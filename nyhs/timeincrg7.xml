			<head>Biographical / Historical</head>
			<p>For the majority of Time Inc.'s existence, the company maintained a strict separation of editorial from the publishing and business side of each magazine, colloquially called the separation of "church" (editorial) and "state" (publishing).  Editorial includes the editors, researchers, and art department. The editorial side reported up to the editor-in-chief and the publishing/business side reported up to the corporate business executive which was the president prior to 1960 and the chief executive officer after. Henry Luce structured Time Inc. this way so that the business side could not (in theory) influence the editorial content of the publications. For example, the advertising sales people could not interfere with a magazine's decision to run an article on the dangers of cigarette smoking, even though it might mean losing millions of dollars in tobacco ads.</p>
			<p>
				<title render="italic">Time</title> is the first magazine created by Time Inc. with the first issue published on March 3, 1923. Time Inc. cofounders Henry R. Luce and Briton Hadden shared the masthead as Editors until Hadden's death in 1929. At this time, John S. Martin became the first Managing Editor of Time with Luce still over him as Editor.</p>
			<p>According to Time Inc., <title render="italic">Time</title> pioneered the news magazine, at least the modern news magazine. <title render="italic">Time</title>'s format of short articles summarizing news events and other items of interest and importance became the standard for later news magazines. Magazine sections included national and international affairs, business, education, science, medicine, law, religion, sports, books, and the arts.</p>
			<p>
				<title render="italic">Time</title> published several foreign-language editions, the first launched in 1941 delivered by air service to Latin America; special issues including the popular <title render="italic">Time</title> Person of the Year (formerly Man of the Year); and <title render="italic">Time for Kids</title>, a children's magazine.</p>

					<p>Otto Fuerbringer started as a writer for <title render="italic">Time</title> in 1942 after working at the St. Louis <title render="italic">Post Dispatch</title>. He served as a senior editor and assistant managing editor, and was promoted to managing editor in 1960. Fuerbringer held this title until May 1968 when Hedley Donovan appointed him as the "chief explorer of Time Inc.'s interests and opportunities in the newspaper field," making him a vice president. This appointment morphed into being the managing editor for the Magazine Development Group. While head of this group, Time Inc. created and first published <title render="italic">Money</title> and <title render="italic">People</title>. Fuerbringer retired from Time Inc. in September 1973.</p>

					<p>While the Otto Fuerbringer Files span his career at Time Inc., the majority of the files date from his role as assistant managing editor and managing editor of <title render="italic">Time</title>.

						<head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
						<p>The Correspondence and Memoranda files were partially processed by the Time Inc. Archives producing the correspondence files titled: Adler, Biographical, Burck, Congratulatory, Pace, Personal, Reese, Time Edit, Toss(?), and parts of General. Some of these files state that they are "from correspondence." Materials remaining in the unprocessed General files are similar to materials found throughout the files created by the Time Inc. Archives which may mean the processing was incomplete. </p>
						<p>General includes letters from subjects of <title render="italic">Time</title> covers (Barbara Streisand and an assistant to Martin Luther King, Jr.); invitations to events and to speak; from various companies including Ford Motor Company; and from social organizations (Harvard Club of New York).   Biographical contains personal correspondence, letters from school acquaintances, and a 1939 article on Fuerbringer from <title render="italic">St. Louis Post Dispatch</title>. Frank Shea was the assistant to the managing editor, and his correspondence primarily contains responses to readers on the behalf of Bernard Auer, Roy Alexander, Fuerbringer during their absences. Toss(?) looks like material weeded out by the Time Inc. archivist for deaccessioning. Personal contains letters to and from family, Harvard Club of New York, and former St. Louis colleagues regarding social events, participation on boards, personal charitable activity, and the handling personal household tasks. </p>
						<p>Other items of interest include an information packet and letter from Ford thanking Fuerbringer for visiting to test drive the upcoming 1964 Ford Mustang; a 1965 letter from <title render="italic">Time</title> writer Henry Grunwald, the future Editor-in-Chief, requesting visas to travel for work.</p>

history of <title render="italic">Time</title> Newstours in Henry Grunwald's files, "the purpose of the Newstour is to give an opportunity to a small group of American leaders to visit areas of the world currently in the news..." While the Newstour is arranged by <title render="italic">Time</title>, each participant pays their own expenses. Newstours includes briefing binders containing itineraries, participant lists, and background information; cables, memoranda, and other correspondence; and notes and other travelogues written by Fuerbringer and other participants.</p>

					<p>J. Dana Tasker handled the retention or disposition of <title render="italic">Time</title>'s cover art. While <title render="italic">Time</title> only acquired the first publication rights for its cover art, it might purchase the original work to gift. Otherwise the artist could sell the original as they wanted. <title render="italic">Time</title> frequently sent as a gift, or presented, cover art to the subject or a related interested party or organization as a gesture of good will, for promotion value, or to continue a relationship with a good source. <title render="italic">Time</title> executives were less likely to gift if they did not think there was any value to the gesture, did not considered the portrait to be a good likeness, if the art was in multiple pieces and therefore not one original to give, or if the artist wouldn't part with it or had another buyer already. Presenters included cofounder Henry R. Luce, Editorial Vice President Eric Hodgins, Publisher P. I. Prentice, or any other <title render="italic">Time</title> employee who had a specific relationship with the recipient. Early cover artists for <title render="italic">Time</title> were Boris Artzybasheff, Ernest Hamlin Baker, Boris Chaliapin, and Guy Rowe.</p>

					<p>J. Dana Tasker's files includes the memoranda, correspondence and invoices related to the retention or disposition of <title render="italic">Time</title>'s cover art. Memoranda from him to Publisher James Linen discuss whether or not original art should go to the subject and the reasons for the decisions. Inventories include reports from the Business Manager James Thomason on covers still in the "bank" for future use with responses from Tasker on which ones to "kill," removing them from storage by returning to the artist or other method. Records also include other interoffice memoranda arranging presentations, correspondence to and from the gift recipients, and framing and shipping invoices.</p>

The majority of prior newstours were organized by <title render="italic">Time</title> Promotion and Public Affairs staff with one in 1995 organized by Corporate Public Affairs.</p>

					<head>Biographical / Historical</head>
					<p>According to an <title render="italic">FYI</title> article published upon her retirement in 1984, Rosemary Frank had been with <title render="italic">Time</title> for 37 years. She first appears on the masthead in January 1947 as an Editorial Researcher. The October 18, 1968 <title render="italic">Time</title> Publisher's Letter states Frank had been a Covers Researcher for four years although she shows up in the records working on covers around 1961. By October 1970, she is listed on the <title render="italic">Time</title> masthead in Covers as part of the Art Department. By the 1980s, Frank is also considered the curator of the <title render="italic">Time</title> art collection.</p>
					<p>Frank arranged travel for artists, tracked their expenses, collected photographs for artists to work from or arranged sittings, scouted galleries for new talent, and screened all unsolicited artwork submitted to <title render="italic">Time</title>. She also served as a contact for the gift of Time Inc.'s cover art collection to the National Portrait Gallery.</p>

					<p>Carbon Files were created by reporters and researchers for every article that ran in a Time Inc. magazine, or in this case every cover created, comprising all the collected research, and retained by that magazine for around 14 months before being turned over to the library and archives. </p>
					<p>Cover Carbon Files include correspondence from the Art Department to <title render="italic">Time</title> Editorial staff Edward Jamieson, James Keough, and Henry Grunwald, <title render="italic">Time</title> Publishing staff, and <title render="italic">Time</title> News Service staff. Besides longtime cover researcher and curator of the <title render="italic">Time</title> cover collection Rosemary Frank, Art Department staff represented include Nancy Atkinson who may have been Frank's predecessor, and cover researcher Nancy Faber.</p>
					<p>Research includes memoranda reporting on statements from the artists (Warhol on his Jane Fonda cover); descriptions of the medium used; color descriptions on the subjects to accompany black-and-white photographs; and correspondence with non-artists to acquire photograph props (hospital for a patient bill; police department for firearms). 1970s files have some information on gifting the cover collection to the National Portrait Gallery.</p>

					<head>Biographical / Historical</head>
					<p>The reports of <title render="italic">Time</title> journalist Rosalind Constable began as an experiment to find content for <title render="italic">Time</title> and <title render="italic">Life</title>. The stated intent was to comment "[On] the contents of the highbrow magazines of England, France and America..." with the first report entitled "Weekly Reports from the Cultural Front." Constable's purview quickly expanded to include publications from and about other countries. The number of magazines reviewed for content were vast and included <title render="italic">Sight and Sound</title>, <title render="italic">La Table Ronde</title>, <title render="italic">The Kenyon Review</title>, <title render="italic">Horizon</title>, <title render="italic">The Cornhill</title>, <title render="italic">Dublin Review</title> and <title render="italic">Japan Quarterly</title>.</p>

				<scopecontent id="aspace_7f7dff342adb6cf357005c172fdf9b6b">
					<head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
					<p>The Rosalind Constable Reports include her weekly reports about cultural affairs and the avant-garde art scene as covered by "the little magazines." Constable wrote on theatre, film, literature, poetry, and art, but also philosophy and intellectualism, and strayed at times into the cultural impact of "bloodsports" and business topics. Examples of report titles include "Science Fiction and the French," "Trends in English Poetry," "The New Religion of Art," and "Democracy is Out." Her later reports include lists of selected New York City cultural events. Also included are memoranda regarding reactions to her reports, requests for specific topics, and publishing statistics.</p>

					<head>Scope and Contents</head>
					<p>Elections Research contains reporting by Time Life News Service on United States presidential nominee conventions and commissioned public opinion surveys focusing on candidates, politics, and elections. The surveys include the full tabulated results and memoranda reports analyzing and summarizing the results. </p>
					<p>While it is not clear who at <title render="italic">Time</title> collected and compiled these materials, some reports are addressed to Assistant Managing Editor Richard Duncan. The firm conducting the surveys was Daniel Yankelovich, Inc., later renamed Yankelovich, Skelly, &amp; White, Inc. (Yankelovich). Some reports are jointly from Yankelovich and the <title render="italic">Time</title> Policy Planning Group. Some reports state they are for <title render="italic">Time</title> Soundings, maybe referring to a magazine section.</p>
					<p>Topics covered by the surveys include social resentment indicator, past voting record, main issues of concern, impressions of prominent people, and opinions on contemporary political and social issues.</p>
