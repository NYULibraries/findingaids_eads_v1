            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Newell Dwight Hillis was born in Magnolia, IA on September 2, 1858. He graduated from Lake Forest College in Lake Forest, IL in 1884 and from McCormick Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Chicago in 1887. In April of 1887, he married Annie Louise Patrick, and later that year he was ordained by the Presbytery of Peoria. After several pastorates in the Midwest, Hillis was called to the Plymouth Congregational Church in Brooklyn in 1899. Plymouth Church was then well known as the Church of clergymen Henry Ward Beecher and Lyman Abbot, whom Hillis succeeded.</p>
            <p>In 1899, after less than a year at Plymouth Church, Hulls withdrew from the Presbyterian Church after writing a letter to the Chicago Presbytery denouncing certain aspects of the Presbyterian Creed. Later in his life he became a Congregationalist.</p>
            <p>While at Plymouth Church Hillis gained in reputation as a preacher, lecturer and author. During his pastorate he published about 1,000 sermons, one each week in the 
                <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph>. Over 20 published volumes by Hillis include collections of his sermons, inspirational works, and a novel. In addition, many of Hillis's addresses were published and distributed as pamphlets.</p>
            <p>In 1915, the failure of Hillis's business ventures and his near financial ruin led to his public "confession" that he had sought material gain, which was unsuitable for a man in his position. His congregation and his colleagues stood by him. Letters of support were numerous and financial assistance was offered by some of his parishoners. Although the publicity which followed the original disclosure was short-lived, Hillis was involved in litigation over this matter for many years with Frank L. Ferguson, former president of the Board of Trustees of Plymouth Church and Hillis's business partner and advisor.</p>
            <p>Throughout World War I, Hillis continued to speak and write extensively on the events of the War. In 1918, he published 
                <emph render="italic">German Atrocities</emph>. His dramatic style of presentation and the sensationalism of many of his "disclosures" about German atrocities aroused a good deal of publicity and ensuing public response.</p>
            <p>As pastor of Plymouth Church, Hillis organized the Henry Ward Beecher Memorial Movement, including the celebration of the Beecher centennial in 1913. He also planned and secured an endowment for the Plymouth Institute, which was well-known for its social service programs.</p>
            <p>Among Hillis's activities outside of Plymouth Church were his involvement in plans for the beautification of Brooklyn, his extensive lecture tours, and his articles and publications on spiritual matters and current topics.</p>
            <p>Newell Dwight Hillis died on February 5, 1929.</p>

            <p>The papers of Newell Dwight Hillis span the years 1883 to 1964. The bulk of the material covers Hillis's life as a clergyman, lecturer and author, particularly during his pastorate at Plymouth Church from 1899 to 1924. The earliest item in the collection is Hillis's 1883 school notebook. Correspondence and papers of his children, Richard Hillis and Marjorie Hillis Roulston, and clippings and ephemera presumably collected by them, make up the small part of the collection that dates after Hillis's death in 1929.</p>
            <p>The collection consists of Hillis's correspondence and writings, business and financial records, ephemera, clippings, scrapbooks, family papers, and photographs. The major activities of Hillis's career that are well documented by the collection are his work in creating the Henry Ward Beecher Memorial and Plymouth Institute at Plymouth Church, and his involvement in World War I, which included two Liberty Loan tours and numerous articles, sermons and lectures on the events of the War and its aftermath.</p>
            <p>Materials relating to these Plymouth Church activities roughly span the years 1906 to 1919 and include correspondence with benefactors, architects, the sculptor Gutzon Borglum, and members of the Church Board, as well as financial records, clippings, and ephemera.</p>
            <p>Papers relating to Hillis's World War I activities can be found in the correspondence, writings, sermons, and scrapbooks. Hillis's consistently strong anti-German stance in his writings and lectures, including disclosures of alleged German atrocities and his attack on the musician Fritz Kreisler in 1917, provide an interesting look at the nature of World War I propaganda. The public response to Hillis as reflected in clippings and the letters that he saved are also of interest.</p>
            <p>In general, Hillis's sermons, lectures, and writings cover many of the major political and social concerns of his times. As such, they provide insight into American society of the early 20th century.</p>
            <p>Correspondence, which covers the years 1892 to 1928, includes letters related to both Plymouth Church business and Hillis's activities outside the Church. Very little correspondence of a personal nature is included. Among those with whom Hillis had an ongoing correspondence over the years were Wilfred C. and Henry Leland (Detroit automakers), Lyman Abbott, General Horatio C. King, and the heirs of John Arbuckle. Arbuckle's heirs, including Christina Arbuckle and Margaret and Martha Janlison, endowed the Plymouth Institute and corresponded frequently with Hillis.</p>
            <p>The collection also includes several letters from J.H. Kellogg of the Battle Creek Sanitarium, and Melvil Dewey, originator of the Dewey Decimal System for library classification, both of whom were friends of Hillis. Letters from Thomas Alva Edison, Booker T. Washington, and William Jennings Bryan can also be found in the correspondence files. A letter from Upton Sinclair in May of 1915 is one of several letters written to and from Hillis regarding his anti-labor stance in the Colorado Mining Strike of that year.</p>
            <p>The scope and content of the writings and sermons, ephemera, clippings, scrapbooks, family papers, and photographs are included in the series descriptions. The collection is arranged into the following eight series:</p>

                    <p>The correspondence covers all aspects of Hillis's professional life. The bulk of the letters fall between 1913 and 1918 and relate to Plymouth Church business, especially plans for the Beecher Memorial and ongoing construction of the Plymouth Institute, and Hillis's personal and business affairs, lecture tours, and publications. A major portion of the correspondence is from parishoners and other followers of Hillis. These are generally letters of support and thanks, or requests for copies of sermons and publications. Hillis's replies to these letters are mostly absent from the series.</p>
