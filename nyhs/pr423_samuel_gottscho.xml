    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Samuel Herman Gottscho (1875-1971) was born in Brooklyn, New York. During his early life, he practiced photography on a part-time basis, deciding to work professionally as a commercial photographer in the 1920s, around the age of 50. Respected as an architectural, landscape, and nature photographer, major collections of Gottscho's work are held by the Library of Congress and the Museum of the City of New York.</p><p>(The above note was derived from Gottscho's entry in Wikipedia.)</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Most of the photographs donated by Elizabeth Barlow Rogers were in frames when donated to N-YHS. These were unframed for conservation purposes by N-YHS conservator Alan Balicki, who stored the photographs with the matting and labeling that accompanied them. The collection was inventoried for this finding aid by archivist Larry Weimer. Added at that time to this collection was a standalone Gottscho photograph from the Photographers File (PR 50).</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of 12 vintage silver gelatin photographs taken in the early 1930s by Samuel H. Gottscho (1875-1971). Ten of the photographs, taken in 1933, are of Manhattan views, and were originally a gift from Gottscho to a Grace Mayer. These include Gottscho's handwritten titles and captions. Generally, these photographs were taken either from an elevated height and show downward sweeping views of the city and wide angles of skylines, buildings, and streets, or ground level, upward looking views of buildings and other features of the urban built environment. </p><p>In addition to the above set, the collection holds two other photographs: one looks east from Manhattan toward Welfare Island (Roosevelt Island) and Queens, and a second is a detailed view within a cemetery on Gardiner's Island in East Hampton, New York.</p>  </scopecontent>
