            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This small collection contains a variety of printed ephemera, including circulars, clippings, fliers, newsletters, typescripts, etc. Many are of a humorous and or satirical nature. The principal themes are expression of opposition to the Vietnam War, and advocacy of greater rights, in particular freedom of speech, for students at the high school. There are also several photographs of a student demonstration and what appears to be a "teach-in."</p>
