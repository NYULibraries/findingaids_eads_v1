            <p>The Edward Leffingwell Jack Smith Curatorial Files contain research material acquired by Edward Leffingwell as he organized the exhibition “Jack Smith: Flaming Creature” for New York’s P.S. 1 Museum and his own record of the exhibition’s development and execution. It includes correspondence, notebooks, printed material, newspaper clippings, audio recordings, posters, flyers and other ephemera. The bulk of collection was created or assembled while Leffingwell was actively planning the exhibition (1993 to 1997), and most of the documents that were produced in the 1960s and 1970s exists here as photocopies – many of which feature Leffingwell’s annotations.</p>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Edward Leffingwell (b. 1941) is an art critic and curator. He received his master’s degree in art history from the University of Cincinnati, with a focus on 19th-Century American portraiture, and then moved to Los Angeles, where he wrote for the 
                <emph render="italic">Los Angeles Free Press</emph> and collaborated with the Abstract Expressionist sculptor John Chamberlain. In the 1980s he was the Director of Programming at New York’s Institute for Art and Urban Resources (now MoMA P.S. 1) and then the Director of Visual Art for the City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, before serving as Los Angeles’s corresponding editor for 
                <emph render="italic">Art in America</emph>.</p>
            <p>Shortly after leaving the Cultural Affairs Department, Leffingwell began research on the experimental filmmaker and performance artist Jack Smith (1931-1989), for what would eventually become Smith’s first career retrospective. “Jack Smith: Flaming Creature” opened at P.S. 1 in October 1997 and ran until March 1998, prompting a feature in 
                <emph render="italic">Artforum</emph> and favorable mention elsewhere. Reviewing the exhibition for 
                <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph>, Holland Cotter wrote that it was “not only an exhaustive archival tour of Smith's career but also a model monographic approach to an artist much of whose primary work was in the ephemeral medium of performance.” In conjunction with the exhibition, Leffingwell oversaw an experimental biography that also served as an exhibition guide, 
                <emph render="italic">Flaming Creature: Jack Smith, His Amazing Life and Times</emph> (from Serpent's Tail Books) and edited a collection of Smith’s writings, 
                <emph render="italic">Wait for Me at the Bottom of the Pool</emph>, (from Serpent’s Tail's New York-based imprint, High Risk).</p>
            <p>Following the Jack Smith exhibition, Leffingwell went to Sao Paolo to cover the emerging art scene for 
                <emph render="italic">Art in America</emph>, and remained the magazine's corresponding editor from Brazil until 2012. Over the course of his career, Leffingwell wrote fourteen books and exhibition guides, as well as dozens of articles about 19th and 20th-Century art, with a strong focus on conceptual works.</p>

            <p>The Edward Leffingwell Jack Smith Curatorial Files are arranged in Leffingwell’s original order, retaining his folder titles and series separations (though in some instances, additional information has been added parenthetically). The files are grouped into two series of manuscript material and a series of audio media that features subseries, as well as an oversize series with two subseries reflecting the original manuscript series separations. Due to the broad date ranges contained within each folder, the first two series have been organized alphabetically, whereas the audio recordings are organized chronologically (where possible).</p>
