<p>The Marion Nestle Papers collection was processed even as Nestle continued to donate her vast book collection to the Fales Library. For the most part, Nestle's book library has been catalogued separately from the personal papers. Books that remain in the collection are either annotated or appeared to be directly relevant to the surrounding printed material. A related name search in Bobcat under "Cecily Brownstone" will retrieve records for the entire library.</p>  </separatedmaterial>

<p>Marion Nestle is a nutritionist, consumer advocate, and academic whose research examines scientific and socioeconomic influences on food choice, obesity, and food safety, emphasizing the role of food marketing.

She is Paulette Goddard Professor in the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health at New York University, which she chaired from 1988-2003.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Marion Nestle Papers document Marion Nestle's career as an author, public figure, and professor in the nutrition, food studies, and public health fields. The collection primarily consists of materials involved in the creation of her books, including Nestle's notes, research files, correspondence, book tour plans, and book drafts. Printed materials including restaurant menus, and food event flyers, and conference programs comprise another significant component of the collection. Nestle's correspondence with other authors, professors, and individuals from the food studies movement as well as materials from her professional roles as the senior nutritionist at the Surgeon General, as a teacher at New York University, the University of California at Berkeley and San Francisco, and as a lecturer at food-related events, colloquia, and symposia constitute a smaller part of the collection. Nestle's role as an editorial reviewer and advisor appear in the correspondence and printed materials she collected. The bulk of Nestle's research files span the years 1980-2013.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>The collection was donated to NYU's Fales Library and Special Collections in several stages by Marion Nestle between 2004 and 2018. The accession numbers associated with these gifts are 2011.159, 2013.159.001, 2013.159.002, 2016.014, 2016.016, 2017.025, and 2018.069.</p><p>Websites were initially selected by curators and captured through the use of  Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In December 2011, https://www.foodpolitics.com/ was added as part of the Food Blogs Web Archive.  In 2016, http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-08-04/one-plus-one:-marion-nestle/7691372/ and  http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/news/oneplusone/video/201608/ONEs_Tx_0508_1000k.mp4  were added to the Marion Nestle Web Archive.
