    <abstract id="aspace_5a0a1a63ab5f31a60a39bb43510875ec">SLAM! (formed in 1996) was a citywide radical student activist group, based at Hunter College, City University of New York (CUNY). SLAM!'s main organizing concern was to stop the budget cuts and tuition hikes at CUNY, but they also addressed various social justice issues, particularly those relating to the ethnically and racially diverse and largely working class student body at CUNY. The records include meeting agendas and minutes, promotional material and brochures, material related to reading groups and fundraising; topical campaign files, including material related to Mumia Abu-Jamal Youth, Rising: Taking Back our Stolen Education, CUNY Coalition for Open Admissions campaigns; documents related programs such as the Summer Youth Employment Program and the High School Organizing Program; commercial and recorded VHS tapes related to Crazy Horse, Nelson Mandela, workers rights issues, 9/11 and global economic theory.</abstract>

There are also some programs and literature for causes SLAM! supported, but these tend to be much more in-depth, such as conference agendas. Additionally, there are a couple folders containing literature and a collection of emails related to the literature or cause the literature discusses.
