            <p>Bob Holman's varied career has been devoted to promoting poetry in American culture. Born in 1948 in Harlan, Kentucky and raised in rural Ohio, Holman attended Columbia College and graduated in 1970 with a degree in English. In 1974 Holman began his ongoing tenure as the director of the Poets Theatre in New York City and began studying with Ted Berrigan and Alice Notley at the St. Marks Poetry Project. He founded the 
                <emph render="italic">New York City Poetry Calendar</emph> in 1977 and acted as its editor until 1980. With his completion of the St. Marks curriculum in 1978 Holman joined the Project's staff, acting as a coordinator, host, and workshop leader from 1978 through 1984. In later years Holman held similar positions at several non-profit poetry groups and institutions such as the Public Theatre and the Whitney Museum, where he acted as curator for a reading series.</p>
            <p>During the 1970s and 1980s Holman was active as a producer/director of and/or performer in a variety of poetry festivals, tours, and other performances in New York City's Lower East Side poetry scene. From 1988 through 1989 Holman organized and hosted the "Poets in the Bars: A Celebration of the Oral Tradition" reading series sponsored by Creative Time with Pedro Pietry. He also helped to reopen the Nuyorican Poets Cafe in 1989 and worked as one of its co-directors until 1996. During his tenure Holman founded a touring company of poets, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe Live! Touring Company, in 1993 and hosted numerous Poetry Slams, a form of spoken word competition he helped to popularize. He was also active in the production and direction of plays, such as those of the "Poet's Theater Festivals" held by St. Mark's and La Mama Theatre between 1988 and 1990. His productions during the Festivals included stagings of Tristan Tzara's 
                <emph render="italic">Gas Heart</emph>, Antonin Artaud's 
                <emph render="italic">Jet of Blood</emph>, Vladimir Mayakovsky's 
                <emph render="italic">Mayakovsky: A Tragedy</emph>, and Alfred Jarry's 
                <emph render="italic">Ubu</emph>.</p>
            <p>Holman's first poetry video, 
                <emph render="italic">sweat'n'sex'politics</emph>, was introduced at The Public Theatre in 1985. The next year he began a two year tenure in the Poetry/Video Learning Project, a part of the New York City Public School system's anti-dropout efforts, designed and produced by Rise and Shine Productions. The program targeted truant high school students and offered them the opportunity to write poems and participate in the production of poetry videos with the assistance of poets. From 1987 until 1995 Holman produced and acted as the host for 
                <emph render="italic">
                    <extref ns2:href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bobholmanpoet?feature=mhsn#g/a">Poetry Spots</extref></emph>, a six season broadcast of video poems on WNYC-TV which received three Emmy awards. During the 1990s Holman also produced a number of poetry television programs for PBS and MTV, including several documentaries regarding poetry in the United States. Among them are PBS' 1990 
                <emph render="italic">Poet in the Third Dimension</emph>, the 1991 
                <emph render="italic">Words In Your Face</emph> directed by Mark Pellington, the 1994 
                <emph render="italic">Slammin'</emph>, and MTV's 
                <emph render="italic">Smokin' Word</emph>. One of the largest of such projects was the 
                <emph render="italic">United States of Poetry</emph>, a critically acclaimed five part television series co-created by Bob Holman and directed by Marc Pellington during 1996 for PBS. The program featured over sixty poets, rappers, cowboy poets, American Sign Language poets, and Slammers. The series received the 1997 International Public Television award, the San Fransisco Film Festival award, and the University of Virginia Film Festival award. In subsequent years the project completed a companion anthology, a home video release from KQED, and a soundtrack CD. Holman also [produced]a digital anthology entitled 
                <emph render="italic">World of Poetry</emph> (worldofpoetry.org) and supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, describes itself as a continuation of the 
                <emph render="italic">United States of Poetry</emph> project.</p>
            <p>In 1995 Bob Holman, Sekou Sundiata, and Bill Adler founded Mouth Almighty/Mercury Records as the world's first major label for poetry CDs, with Holman acting as its Vice-President of Artistic Development until 1999. The label released numerous audio tracks, including works by Sekou Sundiata, Maggie Estep, Wammo, Michele Serros and Beau Sia. Some of its major releases included Allen Ginsberg's 
                <emph render="italic">The Ballad of the Skeletons</emph>, Hal Willner's compilation album 
                <emph render="italic">Closed on Account of Rabies: Poems and Tales of Edgar Allan Poe</emph>, and a definitive four CD William Burroughs box set, which was nominated for a Grammy Award.</p>
            <p>Between 1993 and 1996 Holman was a Professor of Writing at The New School for Social Research, and from 1998 until 2002 a Visiting Professor of Writing and Integrated Arts at Bard College. Holman then shifted to Columbia University's School of the Arts where, as a Visiting Professor of Writing, he taught the graduate course "Exploding Text: Poetry Performance".</p>

Among their contents are recordings of works by poets Maggie Estep, Sekou Sundiata, Allen Ginsberg, and Bill Moyers. The two 16mm film reels are recordings of elementary education films regarding poetry and haikus.</p>
