Five are from George Watt, then in the US Army; three of these are to Milt Wolff. Two letters are about George Watt.

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>From an early age, George Watt (1913-1994) was involved in Communist activities, serving as executive secretary of the Communist National Student League. From 1937-1939, he was a political commissar in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. Watt later served as a sergeant in the Army Air Force during World War II. </p><p>After the war, Watt became an official of the American Communist Party. He was one of a group of party officers convicted of sedition in 1953 (the conviction was overturned on appeal). Watt broke with the Communist Party in 1958. He died in 1994 at age 80.</p><p>Source: NY Times Obituaries, http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/09/obituaries/george-watt-80-hospital-executive.html</p>  </bioghist>
