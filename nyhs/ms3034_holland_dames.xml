                <emph render="bold">The Society of Daughters of Holland Dames, Descendants of the Ancient and Honorable Families of New Netherland</emph> (hereafter “Holland Dames”), was organized on 8 May 1895 and incorporated 9 December 1895 “to perpetuate the memory and promote the principles and virtues of the Dutch ancestors of its members” by collecting and preserving “genealogical and historical documents relating to the Dutch in America,” encouraging “excellence in historical research,” and establishing “commemorative and durable memorials in lasting tribute to the early Dutch settlers.” Similar in aim to the males-only Holland Society of New York (established 1885), the Holland Dames membership is open solely to women over the age of eighteen who can prove descent from an ancestor, male or female, who was born in the Netherlands or New Netherland prior to the 1674 Treaty of Westminster (when the Dutch ceded control of the region to the English), or whose ancestor resided in New Netherland prior to the Treaty of Westminster, or whose ancestor held some official capacity in New Netherland (e.g., a Director General; a member of the Director General’s council; a member of a governmental or religious body; a patroon or freeholder; a commissioner of Indian Affairs, boundaries, or treaties; or a commissioned officer, soldier, or sailor who served in defense of New Netherland).</p>
            <p>In fulfillment of their goals the Holland Dames have placed Dutch-specific monuments around New York City, most notably at St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bowery, where a stained glass window to Peter Stuyvesant (1610-1672), last Director General of New Netherland, was installed above his burial vault in 1903, and at the New-York Historical Society, where a stained glass window entitled “
                <extref ns2:href="http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibit/memorial-henry-hudson-arrival-halve-maen-1609">Memorial to Henry Hudson: The Arrival of the Halve Maen, 1609</extref>,” was installed in the library in 1908. (The Holland Dames later funded the restoration of both windows.)</p>
            <p>From 1915 through the 1990s the Holland Dames provided partial scholarships to American college students of Dutch ancestry. They have supported Dutch historic sites in New York City, such as the 18th-century Hendrick I. Lott House in Marine Park, Brooklyn, and the Brinckerhoff Cemetery, a colonial-era burial ground in Fresh Meadows, Queens. The Holland Dames have hosted visits of the Dutch royal family (by tradition its female members have been honorary Holland Dames), and participated in anniversary celebrations, such as the 2009 Henry Hudson Quadricentennial/NY400, in recognition of their Dutch ancestors.</p>
            <p>The Holland Dames governing board is headed by its Directress General. Twenty-nine women have held that position through 2014:</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The records of the Society of Daughters of Holland Dames span 110 years, from the organization's founding in 1895 through 2015, when the collection was given to the New-York Historical Society. Each Holland Dames officer kept her own records, and reported the activities in her purview monthly or annually. As a result, and because the Society's records were never maintained in a central location, there are decided gaps in coverage. Despite this, the minutes of board and annual meetings provide the best documentation of the Holland Dames' activities and projects, some of which are further detailed in dedicated folders. See, for instance, the papers generated by the 1903 installation of a stained glass window to Peter Stuyvesant in St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery (box 9, folder 18), or the memorial to Society's communal Dutch ancestors proposed for Battery Park, and the ensuing litigation from its designer, sculptor Robert Aitken, who sued for payment (box 8, folder 12).</p>
            <p>Although the collection includes membership registers and printed lists, it lacks the genealogical material supplied by Holland Dames members to prove their Dutch ancestry. Those papers remain in custody of the Holland Dames (

                    <p>This series pulls together varied documents that were stored in loose files and binders. They include correspondence, ephemera, some photographs, clippings, and general subject files relating to Holland Dames activities, events, interests, projects, and outings. The "officers' files" (bulk, 1992-2012), appear to have been assembled by Holland Dames board members, each of whom kept her own records as part of her duties. These include postal and email correspondence, invitations, ceremonial programs, drafts of board minutes, clippings, photographs, and ephemera, such as an orange handkerchief dated "09.09.09" given to invited guests to wave in celebration of the opening of the New Amsterdam Pavilion in Battery Park by Crown Prince (now King) Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands (see box 7, folder 13). The list of Holland Dames Directresses General in the historical note near the start of this finding aid may assist researchers wishing to interpret the material in the officers' files. A small collection of artifacts--largely medals depicting Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands--rounds out the series.</p>
