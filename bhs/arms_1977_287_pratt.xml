    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Calvin E. Pratt (1828-1896) was a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court and resided at 1489 Pacific Street in Brooklyn.  He was born in Princeton, MA, and began studying law in 1849.  He was admitted to the bar in 1852.  Pratt later served with the National Guard of the State of Massachusetts and was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Worcester, MA before relocating to New York to continue legal practice.  He married Susan Ruggles of Brooklyn in 1861.  At the outbreak of the Civil War, Pratt organized the 31st Regiment of the New York Volunteer Infantry, in which he was appointed Colonel.  During the Battle of Mechanicsville in 1862, Pratt suffered a bullet wound to his left cheekbone, which would cause him much suffering throughout the ensuing decades and which was not removed until 1891.  After the War, Pratt returned to practice law in Brooklyn, and in 1865 and 1866 he served as Collector of Internal Revenue for Kings and Queens Counties.  In 1869, he was appointed a Justice of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the Second Judicial District of New York State, a position he held until his death in Rochester, MA.  Pratt was survived by his wife and several daughters.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
