            <p>The conference “New Perspectives on Caribbean Studies: Toward the 21st Century and Prospects for Caribbean Basin Integration,” sponsored by the Research Institute for the Study of Man (RISM) and the City University of New York (CUNY), was held at Hunter College, CUNY, in New York City, from August 28 – September 1, 1984. Vera D. Rubin, Ph.D., founder and director of RISM, Frank McGlynn, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, and Linda Basch, Ph.D., member of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), were the principal organizers of the conference. The Caribbean Studies Association (CSA) provided additional collaboration and support. The conference, which received generous support from the Ford Foundation, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada, attracted 117 participants from the several regions of the Caribbean, the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom. Over 350 people registered for the conference, and many others, primarily students, attended without registering.</p>
            <p>“Pacem in Maribus” (Peace in the Ocean) was chosen as the theme of the conference, to foster an air of cooperation and inclusion, and to establish a framework for exploring relationships between nation and culture, political economy and scientific progress, social organization and the arts, and agriculture and public health. Critical responses to the recently implemented Caribbean Basin Initiative, a United States program for trade provisions with Caribbean and Latin American countries, shaped the primary goals of the conference: to revisit, review and reorient long-standing theoretical issues associated with Caribbean studies. The conference was designed to stimulate direct engagement among scholars working in different countries addressing theoretical and methodological issues with an interdisciplinary focus on the region as an integrated whole.</p>
            <p>More than one hundred prominent Caribbean scholars, government officials and policymakers engaged in a scholarly examination of the economic, political and social issues particular to the Caribbean region. Notable speakers included Michael Manley, former Prime Minister of Jamaica and leader of the People’s National Party (PNP), novelist and poet George Lamming, and anthropologist M. G. Smith.</p>
            <p>Conference sessions consisted of presented papers and panel discussions. Participants interacted as discussants and co-chairs, and took part in question-and-answer exchanges with audience members. In addition to the scheduled sessions, there was a series of informal panel discussions, referred to as “roundtable sessions,” in which two to six scholars discussed significant contemporary issues in the Caribbean. Roundtable sessions were video-recorded with the intention of producing short educational videos on Caribbean issues to be used throughout the CUNY system. Guided by framing questions, roundtable participants reflected on seven main topics: history of the region, artistic culture and politics, the “crisis” caused by multiple development policies in the Caribbean, transnational oil companies in Trinidad, obstacles to socioeconomic and political change, intraregional and international migration, and Haitian political and cultural issues.</p>
            <p>Additional recorded highlights of the conference included an awards ceremony for outstanding achievement in the creative arts hosted by Donna Shalala, former President of Hunter College. Award recipients were Calypso singer Mighty Sparrow (Slinger Francisco) of Trinidad and Tobago, author George Lamming of Barbados, and sculptor Edna Manley of Jamaica, whose award was accepted by her son Michael Manley on her behalf.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The records of the conference “New Perspectives on Caribbean Studies: Toward the 21st Century and Prospects for Caribbean Basin Integration” span the years 1979 to 2008, consist of approximately 17.5 linear feet (29 boxes), and include correspondence, mailing lists, published and unpublished manuscripts, abstracts, curricula vitae, advertisements, annual reports of foundations, artwork, flyers, posters, greeting cards, book reviews, articles, journals, brochures, clippings, conference programs and proposals, maps, press releases, photographs, audio and video recordings, transcripts and ephemera. The material has been organized as 16 series (see Arrangement, p. 6). Specific details of chronological or alphabetical arrangement are included in the scope and content note for each series.</p>
            <p>Series I. Correspondence includes correspondence with many prominent government officials that laid the groundwork for the conference. Series IV. Publicity documents the organizers’ efforts gain support and to promote interest in the conference, and includes meeting minutes, flyers and conference programs, and post-conference articles published by Hunter College.</p>
            <p>Series II and III were removed from the collection. (See “Separated Materials” for details.)</p>
            <p>Series VI. Conference Participant Files contains correspondence between Vera D. Rubin and leading contemporary Caribbeanists. Many of these individuals served as co-chairs, participants, or observers at the conference. The files also include manuscripts and articles written by or about conference participants, previously published book reviews, original artwork, greeting cards, invitations, curricula vitae and posters.</p>
            <p>Additional post-conference reportage can be found in Series VII. Clippings, and photographic materials in Series VIII show highlights of the conference.</p>
            <p>Series XI, XII and XIII contain published and unpublished manuscripts (Mss.) covering an extensive range of issues impacting the Caribbean Basin in the 1980s: social stratification, cultural identity, religion, the effects of migration, the status of health systems, agricultural development, science and technology, and 'political' music and other politicized forms of creative expressions. These series include conference presentations and post-conference submissions for publication. Following Dr. Rubin's untimely death in February 1985, plans for the publication of the conference proceedings by Yale University Press continued until 1987, but ultimately were not realized; Series XII. Yale University Press Manuscripts contains manuscripts prepared for this publication. In the interim, Frank McGlynn published a select number of original manuscripts in December 1986 in the journal Third World Studies (see Series XIII. Published Manuscripts).</p>
            <p>Series XVII. Digitized Audio and Video Recordings and Transcripts contains a three-volume duplicate original manuscript produced for institutional circulation by the Research Institute for the Study of Man (RISM) and InterAmericas, programs of The Reed Foundation. “New Perspectives on Caribbean Studies: Toward the 21st Century and Prospects for Caribbean Basin Integration” Transcripts of the Audio and Video Recordings, edited by Mercedes Duff with Danielle Davenport and Jane Gregory Rubin, is comprised of transcripts and digitized copies of the analog audio and video recordings in Series XVI, prints of video stills and selected photographs from Series VIII, and an index to the audio and video transcripts, photographs, and video stills. Spanish and Haitian Creole audio and video material was transcribed and translated by Danielle Davenport and James Larèche.</p>

                    <p>Approximately 3.5 linear feet (7 boxes), arranged alphabetically by last name. Representing the largest series in the collection, these files were maintained for individuals who presented papers, served as co-chairs or were discussants. The files include correspondence, personal greeting cards, abstracts, curriculum vitae, newsletters, journals and clippings. Items of note include Vera D. Rubin's opening remarks (see Box 12, Folder 130) and articles, book reviews and earlier writings by and about conference presenters. For the original manuscript papers delivered at the 1984 conference, see Series XI. Conference Manuscripts. Duplicate copies of the manuscripts, taken from the Library of Caribbean Research, are listed in the Appendix. A select number of these papers were also part of a planned publication (see Series XII. Yale Press Manuscripts and subsequently published (see Series XIII. Published Manuscripts).</p>

                    <p>2.0 linear feet (4 boxes). Arranged in order of presentation (see conference programs, Box 16, Folder 1). Although some Mss. titles differ from those listed in the conference programs, this series consists of original conference manuscripts. Highlights include the opening remarks by Vera D. Rubin (see Folder 3), original art work, the closing address by former prime minister Michael Manley and papers associated with the award ceremony. Based on the correspondence and tally sheets in this series, some Mss. were revised or formalized after the conference for publication. Several Mss. were not submitted.</p>
