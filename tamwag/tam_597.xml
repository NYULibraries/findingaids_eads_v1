                    <p>Workers Solidarity Alliance is an anti-capitalist, anti-authoritarian organization of activists who believe that working people can build a new society and a better world based on the principles of solidarity and self-management. WSA also publishes ideas and action, which was created in July, 1981 as an independent anarcho-syndicalist semi-annual print magazine. After Workers Solidarity Alliance was founded in November, 1984, ideas and action became the magazine of WSA (with issue #5), and continuing through the publication of issue #17 in 1997. It now exists as a blog on the WSA website.</p>
