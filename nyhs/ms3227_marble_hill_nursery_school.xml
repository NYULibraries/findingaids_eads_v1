    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Marble Hill Nursery School was founded in 1953 as a non-profit, parent-cooperative nursery school to serve families living in the Marble Hill Houses, a NYCHA development in the Bronx. (Although it is technically the northernmost neighborhood of Manhattan, Marble Hill is physically and politically connected to the Bronx as Bronx Community District 8.) Parents assist in school fundraising activities, volunteer in the classrooms, serve on committees, and may choose to serve on the board of directors. The school celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2023. (For more information, see <extref ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="https://marblehillnurseryschool.org/">marblehillnurseryschool.org</extref>.)</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection stems from Evelyn I. Lowell (1918-2016), first president of the Marble Hill Nursery School, and contains foundational documentation she preserved, such as agendas, notes, drafts of committee assignments, correspondence, and budgetary requirements. Also included are proposals for a television program—tentatively titled "Wonderland Playground" and based on the Marble Hill Nursery School model—that Lowell hoped to sell to the CBS and DuMont networks. The collection includes drafts of an article "Playing is Children's Work," a guide for parents interested in establishing nursery schools in their communities, which Lowell unsuccessfully submitted to various publications. A small group of publications on child welfare supplements the collection.</p>  </scopecontent>
