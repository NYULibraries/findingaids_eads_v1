			<head>Historical Note</head>
			<p>For the majority of Time Inc.'s existence, the company maintained a strict separation of editorial from the publishing and business side of each magazine, colloquially called the separation of "church" (editorial) and "state" (publishing). Editorial includes the editors, researchers, and art department. The editorial side reported up to the editor-in-chief and the publishing/business side reported up to the corporate business executive which was the president prior to 1960 and the chief executive officer after. Henry Luce structured Time Inc. this way so that the business side could not (in theory) influence the editorial content of the publications. For example, the advertising sales people could not interfere with a magazine's decision to run an article on the dangers of cigarette smoking, even though it might mean losing millions of dollars in tobacco ads.</p>
			<p>Time Inc. published the first issue of <title render="italic">Life</title> on November 23, 1936. In the initial proposal to the board, the specifications were that it would be the same size as the <title render="italic">Illustrated London News</title>, printed on shiny paper with around 200 high-quality photographs recording significant current news events including detailed captions. Because the suggested price would be 10 cents per issue, the initial title was <title render="italic">Dime, The Show-Book of the World</title>. According to Elson, staff and charter subscribers were asked to submit other names, and the title <title render="italic">Life</title> was suggested by both cofounder Henry Luce's wife Clare Luce and Time Inc. president James Linen's father. Since the name was already in use by another publication, Luce purchased it in order to acquire the rights. </p>
			<p>The first staff members in 1936 were Luce as managing editor with John Martin as an alternate, Daniel Longwell as picture editor, Alfred Eisenstaedt and Peter Stackpole as staff photographers, and Mary Fraser as copy chief.</p>
			<p>For financial reasons, Time Inc. suspended production of <title render="italic">Life</title> as a weekly magazine in December 1972, but began planning a revival almost immediately. The Magazine Development department published the first <title render="italic">Life</title> special in 1973 as a newsstand magazine followed by nine more. Time Inc. revived <title render="italic">Life</title> as a monthly in 1978. In 2000, publication was again suspended, but revived in 2004 as a newspaper supplement. In 2007, Time Inc. completely ceased printing of <title render="italic">Life</title> and created a website for images from the collection.</p>

					<p>Ralph Graves was a long-time reporter then Senior Staff Editor for <title render="italic">Life</title> before being appointed its managing editor in 1969. As Time Inc. suspended publication of <title render="italic">Life</title> in 1972, he was the last managing editor of the original <title render="italic">Life</title>. After the closure of <title render="italic">Life</title>, Graves held editorial positions at the corporate level. He retired from Time Inc. in 1983.</p>

					<head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
					<p>Records includes correspondence and subject files from Ralph Graves during his tenure as Managing Editor of <title render="italic">Life</title> spanning from 1968 to 1973 documenting editorial content and story selection, background information on articles, and the publication process. Some files are from his prior position as Senior Staff Editor.</p>
					<p>The general correspondence contains primarily letters from readers including article suggestions and letters from children as school assignments; invitations; and some correspondence with other Time Inc. departments. Items of interest include an invitation from Roy Disney to attend the opening of Walt Disney World (1971); an advice request from an editor at Screw magazine (1971); and letters from Ray Bradbury offering poems on space exploration for publication (1970). The poems are no longer present and may have been moved to his Bio File in RG 2.</p>
					<p>It is unclear if the empty folders ever contained records, and if they were created by Grave's office or by the Time Inc. Archives. </p>

					<head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
					<p>The majority of this material is from <title render="italic">Life</title> Managing Editor (ME) Jim Gaines, who began in this role in 1989 after serving as <title render="italic">People</title> ME. Other MEs represented in the materials are Judy Daniels and Richard Stolley, who succeeded Philip Kunhardt briefly before Daniels. A container list accompanied the files stating that the materials were sent to the archives by <title render="italic">Life</title> Chief of Research June Goldberg, but not that they are her files.</p>
					<p>Several files refer to <title render="italic">Life Weekly</title>, which is a new iteration of <title render="italic">Life</title> intended to be different from both the original and the revived monthly. The 1990 presentation from Gaines describes it.</p>
					<p>Some folders have <title render="italic">People</title> magazine materials, possibly carried over by Gaines.</p>

					<head>Biographical Note</head>
					<p>Alfred Eisenstaedt was born in Dirschau, West Prussia (present day Tczew, Poland) in 1898 and became interested in photography in his early teens. His interest in photography was interrupted for a time when he was drafted into the German army as an artilleryman. He was injured during his service and sent home for rehabilitation.</p>
					<p>After the war, Eisenstaedt moved to Berlin to work as a salesman and used his free time to study and experiment with photography. In 1927, his photograph of a girl playing tennis was bought by <title render="italic">Der Welt Spiegel</title>, an illustrated weekly, and published as a back-of-the-book feature.</p>
					<p>Eisenstaedt kept photography became a full-time photographer in 1929. His first position was as a special photo reporter for Pacific and Atlantic Photos. In 1931, Pacific and Atlantic Photos was taken over by the Associated Press, and Eisenstaedt remained emploted with the Associated Press.</p>
					<p>In 1935, Eisenstaedt moved to the United States and took a position with <title render="italic">Life</title> by 1936. Eisenstaedt was one of four photographers to work in the original photography department and was a staff photographer for publication of the first issue. After joining <title render="italic">Life</title>, Eisenstaedt became known for his photographs of political leaders and movie stars. In addition to these subjects, Eisenstaedt also photographed America rebuilding after the depression, Japan during the war and post-war era, and the people and rulers of nations throughout the continent of Africa. His best known photograph may be of the Time Square kiss on V-Day.</p>
					<p>Along with having his photographs featured in <title render="italic">Life</title>, Eisenstaedt has also published a number of books including <title render="italic">Witness to Our Time</title>, <title render="italic">The Eye of Eisenstaedt</title>, <title render="italic">Martha's Vineyard</title>, <title render="italic">Witness to Nature</title>, <title render="italic">Wimbledon: A Celebration</title>, <title render="italic">People</title>, <title render="italic">Eisenstaedt's Guide to Photography</title>, <title render="italic">Eisenstaedt's Album</title>, and <title render="italic">Eisenstaedt: Germany</title>.</p>
					<p>Before his death in 1995, Eisenstaedt had completed twenty-five thousand assignments for Life and had received numerous awards for his work. Among the awards he received were Photographer of the Year from the Britannica Book of the Year and the University of Missouri School of Journalism in 1951, the Clifton C. Edom Award for Photographic Achievement from Kappa Alpa Mu Nation Photojournalism Fraternity in 1953, the Culture Prize in Photography from the Germany Society of Photographers in 1962, the International Understanding Award for Outstanding Achievement in Photography in 1967, the National Press Photographers Association Joseph A. Sprague Memorial Award in 1971, and the Lifetime Achievement Award in Photography from the American Society of Magazine Photographers in 1979. Along with his awards, Eisenstaedt was voted as one of the world's greatest photographers in a 1968 poll conducted by Popular Photography and was present with the #1,000,001 Leica Camera by E. Leitz Inc. in 1961.</p>
