Sagalyn for her book "Power at Ground Zero: Politics, Money, and the Remaking of Lower Manhattan," published by Oxford University Press in 2016. Heavily represented in the collection are documents concerning the major institutional players in the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site, such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Silverstein Properties Inc. and other entities associated with developer Larry Silverstein, various levels of government, and others. Also with significant representation in the documents are those concerning the families of those killed on 9/11, cultural groups, civic organizations, urban and regional planning advocacy organizations, and others. The documents include a vast array of Board materials; contracts and other legal documents; arbitration and judicial decisions; presentations, testimony and other position statements; requests for proposals and responses to proposals; analyses, audits and other reviews and assessments; fact sheets, press releases, and other public relations and public engagement documents; economic assessments, project funding mechanisms, and other financial matters; news articles, architectural critiques, and other press and media coverage; and more. The collection also includes chronologies and other work product prepared by Sagalyn and her research assistants. The collection has both paper-based and digital components.</abstract>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes the research files amassed by Lynne Sagalyn for her book "Power at Ground Zero: Politics, Money, and the Remaking of Lower Manhattan," published by Oxford University Press in 2016. The documents include a vast array of Board meeting minutes and resolutions; contracts, agreements, leases, and other legal documents; arbitration and judicial decisions; remarks, presentations, speeches, testimony, and other position statements; requests for proposals, proposals, and responses to proposals; analyses, reports, performance audits, project status, and other reviews and assessments; fact sheets, press releases, publicity materials, and other public relations and public engagement documents; financial statements, annual reports, economic assessments, capital plans and budgets, project funding mechanisms, and other financial matters; news articles, editorials, opinion pieces, architectural critiques, and other press and media coverage; and more.  </p><p>Heavily represented in the collection are documents concerning the major institutional players in the redevelopment of the World Trade Center site (WTC), such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC), Silverstein Properties Inc (SPI) and other entities associated with developer Larry Silverstein, and the World Trade Center Memorial Foundation. Also with significant representation in the documents are those concerning the families of those killed on 9/11, cultural groups, civic organizations, urban and regional planning advocacy organizations, and others. Government involvement from the city level to the state and federal level, including on matters of transportation, historic preservation, and economic revitalization, is also represented. In short, the collection includes all the documents underlying the multi-faceted complexities of rebuilding at the WTC site that Sagalyn harnessed in her writing of "Power at Ground Zero."</p><p>In addition to the source documents, the collection also holds chronologies, press logs, summaries, and other work product prepared by Sagalyn and her research assistants. The collection holds both Sagalyn's paper-based files and her digital files. There is overlap between these, in that some digital content was printed out and included in the paper files. But there is also much that is found in one place or the other because not all digital content was printed and, vice versa, not all printed material is in digital format. See the further note below for more information about specific primary source documents in the collection.<lb/> <lb/></p><p>
<emph render="bold">Bibliography for "Power at Ground Zero": Major Primary Sources</emph></p><p>With her donation to N-YHS, Lynne Sagalyn provided a list of her major primary sources that goes beyond those included in the published book. Following is that list. Some of these can be found within the paper files though likely most others are in digital form. In either case the organization of the following list does not correspond precisely with the organization of the paper and digital files. The body of digital files can be searched using keywords from this list to find particular documents. It was not confirmed by the processing archivist as to whether or not all listed documents are in the collection.</p><p><emph render="bold">Planning for Rebuilding</emph></p><p><emph render="underline">Government Actors:</emph><lb/> <lb/>
