    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Plymouth Church was founded in Brooklyn, New York in 1847 by New England transplants desiring a Congregational church. It was originally located on Henry and Remsen Streets, with a second location in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. Henry Ward Beecher (1813-1887) served as its pastor from its founding in 1847 to his death in 1887. Beecher was regarded as a brilliant orator and abolitionist. Under Beecher's leadership, Plymouth Church expanded its role within the community; the church adopted missions, notably the Bethel Mission, at 15 Hicks Street, in 1866, and Navy Mission, located near the Brooklyn Navy Yard, in 1871. The church also organized auctions where church goers could buy the freedom of enslaved people. Beecher was succeeded by Lyman Abbott in 1887. In 1902, Plymouth Church installed stain glass windows and received a $100,000 endowment as part of the Henry Ward Beecher Memorial Plan. </p><p>Linda Nakdimen is a member of Plymouth Church. She is an acquaintance of Stuyvesant "Peter" Barry and Alice Trumbull (Scoville) Barry, who is the great-great-granddaughter of Henry Ward Beecher. </p><p>For more information on Plymouth Church and Henry Ward Beecher, see the <extref href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/bhs/arc_212_plymouth_beecher/bioghist.html">Guide to the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims and Henry Ward Beecher Collection, 1819-1980</extref></p>  </bioghist>
