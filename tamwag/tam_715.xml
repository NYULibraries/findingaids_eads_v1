    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Cindy Sheehan (b. 1957) is an activist, author, former congressional candidate for California's 8th District, and former gubernatorial candidate for the state of California. Sheehan's anti-war activism stems from the death of her eldest son, U.S. Army Specialist Casey Austin Sheehan (1979 - 2004), who was killed in combat during the Iraq War. In 2005, Sheehan garnered national and international media attention when she established an anti-war encampment, later named Camp Casey, outside of President George W. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas. Camp Casey existed for five weeks, attracting the voices and physical presence of supporters and detractors alike. </p><p>Sheehan is also a founding member of the Gold Star Families for Peace. Established in 2005, this organization is an affilite of Military Families Speak Out and supports families whose loved ones were killed in action during the Iraq War. In addition to her activism, Sheehan has written several books --<emph render="italic">Dear President Bush</emph>,<emph render="italic">Peace Mom</emph>,<emph render="italic">Not One More Mother's Child</emph>,<emph render="italic">I Left My Marbles in San Francisco: The Scandal of Federal Electoral Politricks</emph>, and <emph render="italic">The Obama Files: Chronicles of an Award-Winning War Criminal</emph>-- all of which discuss her political views as a part of her anti-war campaigning. </p><p>In 2008, Cindy Sheehan ran against Nancy Pelosi for a seat in Congress, but was unsuccessful, having received only 16% of votes. In 2012, she was selected as the Vice Presidential nominee for the Peace and Freedom Party. In 2014, Sheehan participated in California's gubernatorial election and lost having only received 1.2% of the statewide vote. </p><p>Starting in 2009, Sheehan began hosting a weekly radio show where she interviewed individuals including Hugo Chavez and Howard Zinn. Sheehan also maintains a blog called "Cindy's Soapbox." </p>  </bioghist>

<p>At the time of accessioning, materials were placed in new acid-free folders and boxes. One notebook with mold was cleaned, and re-filed into Box 6. In 2021, additional archived website was added to the finding aid.</p><p>During summer 2022, the Cindy Sheehan Papers were processed at the file level and related materials were grouped together. The collection was rehoused into acid-free folders and boxes. Some original titles were maintained, however, due to the vague description of most origintal titles, more specific titles were applied, when possible. During processing, duplicate materials were discarded and commercially published materials were removed from the collection.</p><p>New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. 10 optical disks were forensically imaged using FTK Imager, Exact Audio Copy, and Isobusters Pro. After being analyzed by an archivist, 6 of the disks were eventually deaccessioned either due to copyright or lack of data on the disk. </p><p>File titles were reviewed by the processing archivist and when identified as restricted, these materials were physically separated and stored in a designated restricted box (Box 11). The electronic file associated with "Correspondence - Lori Ann Zarlenga -- Medical Records" contains material protected under HIPAA and was also restricted.</p>  </processinfo>
