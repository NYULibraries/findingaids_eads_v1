    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains posters, t-shirts, scrapbooks, and other promotional material primarily related to the gay club scene in New York City during the late 1970s through the 1990s. Materials include event posters for New York clubs including The Saint, Flamingo, Roseland, Roxy, The Ritz, as well as The Palladium in Los Angeles. Of note are materials from The Saint/The Saint at Large, including a copy of their first season party calendar from 1980 and posters from early club events as well as the closing party in 1988. The collection also includes t-shirts from the Better Bodies Gym, The Saint, Ice Palace, and beach clubs. One of the two scrapbooks assembled by Brosnan in this collection documents the gay club scene at The Saint, Flamingo, 12 West, River Club, and Fire Island's Beach through handwritten reminiscences, membership cards, club rules, clippings of articles, promotional flyers, and invitations. Also of note is a Studio 54 membership card and poker chip, as well as clippings about the club. The other scrapbook contains clippings of articles, pins, and flyers related to AIDS activism (including the AIDS Walk), as well as more general articles on gay relationships. Throughout the scrapbook are Brosnan's written comments on the AIDS epidemic during the 1980s and 1990s and the impact it had on himself and his friends. This collection also contains a copy of Brosnan's 1983 Master's Degree thesis <emph render="italic">Homosexuals Remain 'Closeted' on the Job Fearing Discrimination and/or Reprisal </emph>, written while studying at The New School For Social Research.</p>  </scopecontent>
