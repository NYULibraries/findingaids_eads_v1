    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The New-York Historical Society building renovations and maintenance records include files concerning the Central Park West physical plant from the late 1940s and forward to the present. (For records related to the early 1940s and prior, including the construction of the Central Park West building, see the New-York Historical Society original buildings planning &amp; construction records [NYHS-RG 3]). The record group was compiled from various sources and does not necessarily document, or document completely, all renovation work done over the decades. </p><p>One major initiative that is especially well-documented in the record group is the extensive renovation work that began about 1989 and concluded in 2000 with the opening of the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture (Luce Center). These records include planning documents, such as feasibility studies, proposals, and surveys, and implementation documents, such as contracts, change orders, construction meeting summaries, and payment requisitions. There is extensive correspondence with the architects, engineers, and city agencies that funded the project phases of the late 1990s. There are many architectural drawings, though these are related principally to the early planning work of 1989-1990 done by the firm of Allan Greenberg, Architect. In addition to the Luce Center, these records of projects from the 1990s include work related to the renovation of the Luman Reed Gallery, roof, façade, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, and other areas.</p><p>Aside from the capital improvement projects of the 1990s, several other projects, large and small, are documented to at least some extent, such as the initial installation of air-conditioning in the mid-1960s, the application to the Landmarks Preservation Commission to place a railing at the front entrance in the mid-1970s, and the development of the DiMenna Children's Museum in the late 2000s, as well as various unrealized proposals.</p>  </scopecontent>

The distinguishing feature of this series is that each project documented in it includes a relatively small number of records for each project. These projects range from small, highly focused work, such as the installation of railings at the front entrance in the mid-1970s, to large scale work such as the installation of air-conditioning in the mid-1960s. </p><p>The content of the series appears to have been compiled from a variety of sources. Accordingly, the content is uneven and incomplete as to any particular project. Most documents lack fuller context including whether the work described was completed or not. Nonetheless, many documents provide important information about key projects. These include, among others, the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) Photographic Documentation taken in 2008 and 2010 in advance of interior and exterior renovation work done at that time, including in the auditorium; the early concept documents from Lee H. Skolnick for the DiMenna Children's Museum (2008-2010); and concept documents from Donna Lawrence Productions for the Orientation Theater (2008-2011).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_3f9a99c4c34196a93d340ebdca8ad9d2"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series is arranged in rough chronological order.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref19_uf3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Water Main Break</unittitle><unitdate>1938, 1948</unitdate><container id="aspace_8b950446f0b30f104d8d21755ec5c72f" label="Mixed Materials [10170000020040]" type="Offsite-Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_8b950446f0b30f104d8d21755ec5c72f" type="Folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e053553b3f9e32dfcb3cb24b0ca3ceeb"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes photographs of water main and sidewalk excavation (1948).

These included both infrastructure upgrades, such as to the HVAC system and roofing, and to gallery space, notably the Henry Luce III Center for the Study of American Culture (Luce Center), an open storage facility on the 4th floor that opened in 2000. The series includes files of Chief Operating Officer Ed Norris as they related to the three phase construction project that ran from 1994 to 2000. The series also includes earlier planning and project documents beginning in 1989, some of which were accomplished, such as the renovation and re-installation of the Luman Reed Gallery, and others that could not be fully pursued until later in the decade. These earlier files appear to have been compiled at some point from various departments and offices, likely including from President and Chief Executive Officer Barbara Debs (BKD) and from Museum Director Holly Hotchner (HH).</p><p>The series includes studies and assessments, contracts, status reports, meeting notes, correspondence with architects and with principal contractors, payment requisitions and supporting documentation, permits, budgets, schedules, and other documents concerning the planning and implementation of the renovation projects. The series includes many architectural drawings, principally those from 1989-1990 from the firm of Allan Greenberg, Architect (AGA). The series has a few architectural plans related to the the more extensive project work conducted in the second half of the 1990s.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_43855c19ef462969134613abd41a27ba"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series is organized in three subseries:</p><p>Subseries II.A.

The series centers on the work from 1989-1990 of the architectural firm Allan Greenberg, Architect (AGA), and their specialized consultants including H.B. Fishman (roof repairs); Facade Maintenance Design (façade conservation); Ambrosino, DePinto and Schmieder (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), and electrical); Ambient Labs (asbestos remediation); Severud Associates (structural engineering); George Sexton (lighting); and Clayton-Wilson (construction manager). Among the specific areas impacted by these renovations were the Luman Reed Gallery and the Print Room. Some of the contracted work extended to assessments of the townhouse owned by N-YHS at 15 West 76th Street. Additional projects, including those designed by architect Richard Jansen in the early-mid 1990s are also documented. </p><p>The source of the documents is uncertain, but appear to have been compiled at some point from various departments and offices, likely including from President and Chief Executive Officer Barbara Debs (BKD) and from Museum Director Holly Hotchner (HH). Documents include assessments, condition reports, images, correspondence, proposals, budgets and estimates, landmark alteration applications, permits, and contracts. The subseries includes some architectural plans, but see subseries II.C for the bulk of the drawings by Allan Greenberg, Architect.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_20e47e0471180d9ba18562887875cefc"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series is arranged in two sets.

The second set consists of "additional files" found after the first set of documents was processed; this second set is appended to the container list in alphabetical order by subject.</p><p>The material was originally found in three record cartons and appeared to have been previously compiled from a few N-YHS departments or offices. The processing archivist re-arranged the folders to bring like matter together, but left the contents of each folder to remain as found, even where there was overlap in subjects or documents. Documents were re-housed to archival folders; the labels in the container list were transcribed from the original labels.

Phase I involved installing a new roof, waterproofing the facade, upgrading the HVAC system, and overhauling the electrical system. Phase 2 included new modular chilling units and various interior renovations, such as lighting, smoke detection, handicap accessible toilet, altering certain rooms on the 2nd floor, etc. The third phase saw the development of the Luce Center on the 4th floor.</p><p>The subseries includes extensive correspondence with N-YHS's architect for the project, Beyer Blinder Belle; the construction manager, Lehrer McGovern Bovis (also referred to by its later name, Bovis Lend Lease); and the New York City agencies funding the projects, the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Department of Design &amp; Construction. The subseries also includes contracts, status reports and meeting notes, photographs (found in the monthly reports), and change orders. The series includes several of the periodic applications/requisitions from N-YHS for payment from New York City under the project's pass-through contract. These applications include the extensive support documentation of costs provided by Lehrer McGovern Bovis to N-YHS. Not all applications are in the files and in some instances only the requisition to N-YHS from Lehrer McGovern Bovis are in the files.</p><p>The subseries includes the 1993 feasibility study underlying the project work and concept documents for what became the Luce Center. There are only a few architectural drawings for the work done in these phases.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_0a1ae3ef538b542cd62d72e0d3d8094a"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The bulk of the series is arranged in its original order: alphabetical by topic within the three project phases. After processing, a box of related files were found and added to the end of the container under the heading "Additional Files."
