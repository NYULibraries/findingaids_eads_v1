<p>Eva el Masri Sidhom (born Eva Habib el Masri) was a long-time librarian at New York University. Her husband, Youssef Sidhom, was also a librarian at NYU. </p><p>Sidhom was the first woman to attend and graduate from the American University in Cairo. She also earned a M.A. from Smith College in 1934. After completing her degree in Library Science at Rutgers in 1966, Sidhom began working in the NYU library system, first in the Reference Division, then at the Middle East Library, and finally in the Microform room collection. Sidhom was a librarian at NYU for 11 years.</p><p>Sidhom and her husband were active in the Coptic community. They established the Coptic Association of America and helped found the first NYC-area Coptic church in Jersey City in the early 1960s.</p>  </bioghist>
