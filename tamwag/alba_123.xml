        his introduction to Communist politics. Also included is poetry by Amery on both personal

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Alfred Amery was born in 1909 in Newton, Massachusetts. He joined the Navy at the age of
        17. In 1927, he spent three years in Monterey, California where he was a member of a U.S.
        Cavalry unit. In 1930, he returned to Massachusetts to care for his mother and re-joined the
        army in 1932. During the Depression, Amery was introduced to the writings of Marx, Engels
        and Lenin and developed a left-wing political outlook. Since there was little work to be had
        and his only training was in the military, he decided to go to Spain and fight for the
        Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War. As a volunteer in the International Briagdes, he was a
        commanding officer and fought at Fuentes de Ebro, Teruel, Seguro de los Banos, and the first
        battles of the retreats. During the retreats, he became disillusioned and discouraged with
        the leadership of the Brigades and the war and managed to leave Spain by stowing away on a
        British ship. He eventually made it back to the United States and married Priscilla Wright
        in 1941. Wright operated a preschool and daycare center in Pepperell, MA, while Amery worked
        as a carpenter at a paper mill where he helped organize a union. He wrote poetry on both
        personal and political themes and two autobiographical typescripts about his experience in
        the armed forces during the 1920s and 1930s, his service in the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion
        during the Spanish Civil War and his introduction to Communist politics. Even though he
        deserted from the war and had never been a member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (ALBA), he
        maintained rather cordial relations with some ALB veterans was active in the Veterans of the
        Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Amery died in 2004 and his headstone reads “Veteran of the Abraham
        Lincoln Brigade.”</p>
