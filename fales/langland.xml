            <p>After moving to New York City in the 1970s, Langland began working with choreographer and performer Meredith Monk, whose company he later joined. Langland remained a member of the Meredith Monk Vocal Ensemble until 1985.</p>
            <p>During his time in New York City, Langland also studied closely under dancer Allan Wayne. After Wayne's death in 1978, Langland began teaching his technique, under the name "Allan Wayne Work," and continued to develop his work.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Langland has performed at various notable performance spaces and with various performance groups including The House, Danspace, Dance Theater Workshop, LaMama, The Kitchen, and Franklin Furnace, among others.

                    <p>Series IV consists of posters, programs, and flyers for various dance and arts performances and events. It largely consists of material related to New York City venues from the mid 1970s through the 1990s , but also includes other localities. Included in this series is material related to many notable New York City performance spaces and groups, including Danspace, Dance Theater Workshop LaMama, and Movement Research. Due to the nature of the type of material, many of the posters, programs and flyers do not include a year.</p>

                    <p>Oversize Series IV consists of oversize posters for various dance and arts performances and events. It largely consists of material related to New York City venues from the mid 1970s through the 1990s, but also includes other localities. Included in this series is material related to many noted New York City performance spaces and groups, including Danspace, Dance Theater Workshop, LaMama, and Movement Research. Due to the nature of the type of material, many of the posters do not include a year.</p>
