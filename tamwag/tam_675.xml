            <p>This collection consists of material created and collected by the Gay Asian &amp; Pacific Islander Men of New York (GAPIMNY) during the mid-1990s through the present in the course of their social, educational, and cultural programming for gay, bisexual, queer, and transgender Asians and/or Pacific Islanders in the New York City area. Materials created by GAPIMNY include pamphlets, flyers, leaflets, brochures, stickers, photographs, newsletters, correspondence, meeting memoranda, and some artifacts that were used in parades or demonstrations. Many of these materials were used or intended for distribution, with both general informational documents about the organization and materials specific to particular events or individual advocacy campaigns related to issues such as racism, immigration, or public health. The ephemeral formats present display some of the methods by which the organization sought to reach out to and advocate for its membership. Some of the GAPIMNY initiatives documented in the collection include the multilingual “Love Has No Borders” campaign and the “(In)Visibly American” immigration program. The collection also includes magazines, literary journals, and materials produced by related organizations, the most prominent being the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance (NQAPIA). This collection documents individual activists and community organizations providing support and resources for its membership, and addressing concerns of visibility, representation, and marginalization.</p>

            <p>Gay Asian &amp; Pacific Islander Men of New York (GAPIMNY) is a volunteer-run community organization that provides social, educational, and cultural programming for gay, bisexual, queer, and transgender Asians and/or Pacific Islanders in the greater New York City area. In collaboration with other community organizations, GAPIMNY works to provide peer-support, educational resources, and programming on issues such as race, sexuality, gender, public health, and immigration law. GAPIMNY was founded in 1990 by Don Kao, John Chin, and John Manzon. In the early 1990s, GAPIMNY organized with related groups to achieve greater visibility within the LGBT community and protest stereotypical public representations of Asian men and women. As the organization grew, it started hosting workshops for its community, established an online presence, and organized DynasTea, the organization’s featured event from 1997 until 2006. In 2010, the organization debuted a newsmagazine called 
                <title render="italic">PersuAsian</title>. In more recent years, GAPIMNY has increasingly partnered with other organizations to lead workshops and sponsor public programs on issues such as visibility, immigration, public health, and marriage equality. Some such collaborations include the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Asian Pacific American Coalition for Equality (APACE), Asian Media Watchdog, and Asian Queer United in Action (AQUA). Recent programs and campaigns include participation in Chinatown’s Lunar New Year Parade; continued protest over various examples of racial discrimination, homophobia, or transphobia; and DowneTime, a support program to provide a confidential space to discuss identity issues, attend health workshops, and connect with other members of the community.</p>

            <p>Upon receipt, the majority of materials in this collection were loose, unarranged, and in no apparent order. Some like materials had been grouped together (e.g. - selections of leaflets and copies of newsletters), and these groupings were retained as much as possible. The loose material was examined with the intent of keeping materials together if they were created, used, or collected for the same purpose (e.g.- steering committee meeting agendas, “Love Has No Borders” campaign). A partial inventory of the materials was provided by the donors, which was used as the basis for both identification and description of items. Because of the variety of formats and the presence of oversized items, intellectual arrangement does not necessarily reflect physical arrangement.</p>
