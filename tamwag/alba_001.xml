        (1905-1992) was chief nurse and administrator of the American medical volunteers who served
        during the Spanish Civil War. Following the war, Martin worked on the Pribilof Islands in
        the Bering Sea, becoming spokesperson and advocate for the indigenous Aleut sealing
        community. She produced a series of articles and books on Aleut culture and history and
        edited an Aleut language dictionary. In 1950, Martin moved to Cuernavaca, Mexico, a cultural
        outpost for Spanish exiles and American expatriates. During the 1960s, she initiated
        research for a projected book on the participation of the American medical units in the
        Spanish Civil War. Her papers reveal her dedication to amassing the most comprehensive
        record on the role of medical volunteers in Spain. In addition to the diaries, journals,
        clippings, leaflets and other ephemera donated to Martin, the collection includes extensive
        correspondence between Martin and hundreds of medical and combat veterans from around the
        world.</abstract>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Fredericka (Freddie) Imogene Martin - Spanish Civil War nurse, writer, and historian -- was
        born in Cooperstown, New York on June 2, 1905. Her father died in an accident before her
        birth and when she was five her mother remarried. They moved to Oneonta, New York where
        Martin -- a spirited child by her own account -- grew up in a warm and indulgent family.
        Following high school, she lived and worked with the St. Margaret Episcopalian Order of Nuns
        in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in 1925 attended the affiliated nursing school of Christ
        Hospital. She graduated with honors and as a young woman practiced professionally in
        hospitals throughout New York City. As supervisor and head nurse she served on the staffs of
        Bellevue, Fordham, Lying-In Hospital, and Crotona Park Hospital. In 1929, Martin married
        English-born Alexander Cohen. During the early 1930s Martin became an active member in the
        nurses union, attended political sciences classes at the Labor Temple in New York City, and
        began developing her aptitude for foreign languages, learning Russian and Yiddish. In 1935,
        while visiting her in-laws in England she traveled to Germany and Russia. Her time abroad
        awakened her to the growing threat of Fascism. When she returned, a nurses' union colleague
        encouraged Martin to become active in the then nascent Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish
        Democracy. Initially organized by a group of doctors and concerned citizens to provide
        medical supplies, food and clothing to the beleaguered Spanish Republic, by late 1936 the
        Medical Bureau was recruiting personnel to send to Spain as well.</p>
      <p>On January 16, 1937 Martin embarked on the <emph render="italic">S.S. Paris</emph>as part
        of the first American medical unit to Spain. Under the leadership of surgeon Dr. Edward
        Barsky, Martin served as chief nurse and administrator of the American Hospital division.
        The first unit traveled with four ambulances, 12 tons of medical supplies and all the
        necessary equipment to outfit a 50-bed hospital. During her period of service, Martin
        supervised the work of fifty-four nurses, aided in the organization of six American
        hospitals on four fronts, and helped set up a mobile operating unit. She also organized
        literacy classes and trained Spanish women to assume some of the nursing and hospital
        administration duties. Her commanding bearing (at nearly 5'9" she was a full head taller
        than most of her staff), authoritative mien, and maternal attention to both the patients in
        the ward and the nurses under her management, earned her the affectionate appellation of
        "Ma."</p>
      <p>In February 1938 Martin returned to the United States to conduct a yearlong national
        speaking tour, recruiting personnel and raising funds to keep the medical volunteers in
        Spain supplied. During the West Coast stretch of her tour Martin shared the stage with a
        representative of the Catalan government, and writer Dorothy Parker. Following her tour,
        Martin enrolled in the Public Administration program at New York University. Her studies
        were cut short when, in April 1939, she was invited to establish and serve as superintendent
        of a hospital in Greenbelt, Maryland -- a federally funded housing initiative created under
        the Resettlement Administration.</p>
      <p>Martin's union with Cohen ended in an amicable divorce in the late 1930s and she married
        her second husband, Dr. Samuel Berenberg in 1940. In 1941 Berenberg took a medical
        assignment on the Pribilof Islands 300 miles off the coast of Alaska in the Bering Sea. With
        Martin's assistance, Berenberg managed the Fish and Wildlife Hospital on St. Paul Island.
        Martin's work brought her into contact with the indigenous Aleut sealing community,
        non-citizen wards of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Stirred by their struggle for
        self-determination and freedom from decades of discrimination and exploitation (first under
        the Russians and later the American government), Martin spent the next ten years of her life
        advocating on behalf of the community. She came to be regarded as an expert on the Aleut,
        producing a series of articles and books including <emph render="italic">The Hunting of the
          Silver Fleece</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Sea Bears: the Story of the Fur
          Seal</emph>, editing an Aleut language dictionary, and translating numerous manuscripts
        and articles.</p>
      <p>With the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Martin and Berenberg returned to Greenbelt with their
        newborn daughter Tobyanne (named for Toby Jensky and Anne Taft, two nursing colleagues who
        had served with Martin in Spain). They settled in New York City where Berenberg became the
        chief of the Department of Health's Child Health Services and Martin embarked on her career
        as a writer. Following the dissolution of their marriage, Martin moved with the 9-year-old
        Tobyanne in 1950 to Cuernavaca, Mexico. A cultural outpost for Spanish exiles and American
        expatriates, Cuernavaca proved to be a congenial home for Martin. For the next 40 years she
        supported herself as translator, a travel book writer, and an instructor at a Spanish
        language institute, working with her former Medical Bureau colleague and fellow expatiate
        Lini (Fuhr) de Vries.</p>
      <p>When Spanish Civil War combat veteran Arthur Landis published <emph render="italic">The
          Abraham Lincoln Brigade</emph>in 1967, Martin protested the lack of coverage given to the
        medical units and resolved to write a separate history on the Medical Bureau volunteers. In
        a letter to the Rabinowitz Foundation (08/20/1968) requesting funding for this project,
        Martin wrote:</p>
      <p>"To tell the story of [American Medical Bureau] Field Units, their history must begin with
        the account of the organization and activities of the Medical Bureau in the US, the story of
        the Field Units at work in Spain, and their relationships and work with different
        nationalities and Spanish military and civilian organizations, and finally a summary of the
        contributions of AMB saving the lives of civilians and combatants."</p>
      <p>When Spanish Civil War combat veteran Arthur Landis published <emph render="italic">The
          Abraham Lincoln Brigade</emph>in 1967, Martin protested the lack of coverage given to the
        medical units and resolved to write a separate history on the Medical Bureau volunteers. In
        a letter to the Rabinowitz Foundation (08/20/1968) requesting funding for this project,
        Martin wrote: To tell the story of [American Medical Bureau] Field Units, their history must
        begin with the account of the organization and activities of the Medical Bureau in the US,
        the story of the Field Units at work in Spain, and their relationships and work with
        different nationalities and Spanish military and civilian organizations, and finally a
        summary of the contributions of AMB saving the lives of civilians and combatants.This
        ambitious task would occupy her for the remainder of her life. Working chiefly from her home
        in Cuernavaca, Martin set out to amass the most comprehensive record on the role of the
        medical units in Spain. She enlisted the aid of former veterans, friends, librarians and
        archivists to obtain books and articles, locate missing volunteers, conduct research, and
        contribute primary materials and financial aid. She corresponded with hundreds of medical
        and combat veterans from around the world, sending questionnaires and accruing personal
        data. In the early 1970s she traveled through Europe, Israel and the United States meeting
        with former Medical Bureau colleagues, conducting interviews, visiting research
        repositories, and collecting memorabilia and materials for her history. She traveled to
        Spain in 1972 to conduct research and revisited Villa Paz, the lavish estate that during the
        war had served as a front-line hospital.</p>
      <p>Although Martin produced abundant notes and drafted several chapters, struggles with money,
        poor clerical assistance, and failing health hampered her in her efforts to complete her
        Medical Bureau history. By 1982 her attention turned from her writing project to finding a
        suitable repository to administer the materials she had so assiduously collected and
        maintained in her cramped Cuernavaca cottage. In 1986, in recognition for her contributions
        to the Aleut, Martin was made honorary lifetime citizen of St. Paul Island, and was awarded
        an honorary doctorate by the University of Alaska. On October 4, 1992 Martin died in
        Cuernavaca. She was 87 years old.</p>

          <p><emph render="italic">Series I. Medical Personnel: Biographical Files and
              Correspondence 1936-1988.</emph>This series includes correspondence from and
            biographical material on hundreds of medical volunteers from over 25 countries (Includes
            materials written in Spanish, French, Russian, Rumanian and German). Particularly
            informative are questionnaires sent by Martin and filled in by dozens of doctors,
            nurses, ambulance drives and other medical personnel detailing their activities in Spain
            and their subsequent experiences. These also provide data on political affiliations
            before and after the war and personal motivations for going to Spain. Much of the
            correspondence to and from Martin chronicles the later lives of the volunteers and
            offers insights to the range of attitudes regarding Martin's efforts to record their
            work in Spain. Additionally, this series contains materials donated to Martin, including
            Spanish Civil War letters (originals and copies), diaries and journals (typescripts and
            photocopies) personal essays, clippings, leaflets, and other ephemera. Martin also
            collected medical writings and other materials published by the medical volunteers.</p>
          <p>Notable in this series are: English volunteer Monica Milward Barnett's diary
            (transcription), which provides information on the Spanish Medical Aid Committee office
            in Barcelona; John Patrick O'Reilly's handwritten ward instructions from Villa Paz; a
            typescript in English of Mary Bingham de Urquidi's "Mercy in Madrid: a Personal History
            of the Spanish Civil War" (published in Spanish in 1975 under the title <title
              render="italic">Misericordia en Madrid</title>, an English-language version has never
            appeared in print); recollections of Dutch nurse Johana Maas; letters written by Ave
            Bruzzichesi to Dr. Leo Eloesser describing the withdrawal of foreign units from Spain,
            as well as files on Dr. Eloesser which include dispatches to the Medical Bureau from
            Spain; Spanish Civil War documents and Medical Bureau ephemera from Jose Dhaga, a native
            of Peru who volunteered with the North American medical unit; correspondence and
            material related to Alba Novac and her husband William Ryan, a combat volunteer who
            appeared before HUAC as a cooperative witness; files on Frances Vanzant, the only woman
            doctor attached to the American unit; information on George Zlatovski, charged in 1957
            with spying for the Soviet Union; and Helen Freeman's 1949 letters, written from Germany
            while working for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.</p>
          <p>Letters to and from Martin's close friends Anne Taft Muldavin and Toby Jensky offer
            insights on Martin's life and work over a forty-year period. This series also contains a
            biographical file on Martin, notes she took on her return to Spain in 1972, and a
            hospital ward journal she kept in Spain during the war. Research progress reports and
            rough drafts of Martin's manuscript "Proud within Themselves" (her unfinished history of
            the medical units) can be found here.</p>

          <p><emph render="italic">Series II. Medical Subject Files, 1937-1984.</emph>This series
            contains Martin's research files pertaining to medical aid and services in Spain during
            the war. Materials related to the Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy are located in
            this series including research correspondence related to the establishment and structure
            of the Medical Bureau; brochures, press releases, leaflets, and other ephemera;
            information on the merger with the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy;
            and documents related to the passport application policy for Medical Bureau personnel. A
            file of correspondence, notes and written statements offers evidence of Martin's dogged
            efforts to amass and safeguard materials documenting the history of the Medical Bureau.
            The bulk of this series is devoted to files on the dozens of medical sites that were
            established by the International Brigade medical units during the war. Included are
            accounts excerpted by Martin from letters written by medical and combat volunteers
            detailing conditions and staffing, notes, clippings, and printed material related to
            each location.</p>
          <p>There are several research files on the International Brigades medical services, as
            well as information on ambulance donations and ambulance drivers. Photocopies of
            articles from <title render="italic">Ayuda Medica Internacional</title>, the organ of
            the IB medical services, and files on treatment including the utilization of Hiram Orr's
            closed cast system can also be found here. Noteworthy is a hand-drawn diagram of a
            medical facility, circa 1937, headed "Sanitary Service of a Battalion in the Spanish
            Republican Army."</p>

          <p><emph render="italic">Series III. Combat Volunteers: Biographical Files and
              Correspondence, 1937-1985.</emph>This series includes correspondence from and
            biographical material on Spanish Civil War combat volunteers. Although Martin
            corresponded with volunteers from many countries, the majority of these files document
            United States volunteers. Like the medical personnel files, these files include accounts
            of activities in Spain and chronicle the lives of the veterans in their later years. The
            correspondence and other material here also document the fraternal nature of the
            Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB), which provided financial, medical and
            legal assistance to its members. An example of this can be found in Robert Raven's file,
            which includes leaflets and a 1937 fundraising appeal on Robert Raven Rehabilitation
            Committee letterhead requesting aid for Raven who was blinded in Spain. Also notable is
            VALB correspondence related to the deportation of Carlos Soule Echeveria, a Spanish
            national who fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. (Additional material on veterans
            and VALB can be found in Series V: General Subject Files).</p>
          <p>Among the veterans Martin corresponded with regularly were Edward Lending, David
            Miller, Steve Nelson, Mark Rauschwald, Irving Weissman and Randall (Pete) Smith, who
            headed up the veteran's Spanish Civil War Historical Committee. Other correspondents
            include VALB executive secretary Moe Fishman, Canadian volunteer William Beeching, and
            author Arthur Landis, with whom Martin had a heated exchange over the publication of his
            book. Recurring topics include Martin's concerns over finding a suitable repository for
            the Medical Bureau materials, consideration of whether the veterans should assume
            stewardship of their papers, and the establishment of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade
            Archives at Brandeis.</p>

          <p><emph render="italic">Series IV. General Correspondence, 1937-1985.</emph>This series
            consists of Martin's incoming and outgoing correspondence from a range of friends,
            political figures, researchers and former Medical Bureau officers and organizers.
            Included in this latter category are Executive Secretary Herman F. Reissig, Evelyn
            Ahrend Kirkpatrick, James Loeb, Louis Miller, Harold L. Oram, Violet Robbin, John
            Sherman, and Charles Tobach who contribute information on the structure and activities
            of the Medical Bureau in the United States. Other correspondents include: Canadian
            Communist leader Tim Buck and his wife Bess, journalist Herbert Matthews, writer Joesph
            North and his wife Helen, and Gina Medem, author of a book on Jewish participation in
            the Spanish Civil War. Also included is correspondence from historians Gabriel Jackson,
            Peter Wyden, Robert Rosenstone and Herbert Southworth. Of special note is a 1945 letter
            Martin sent to Congressional Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Sol Bloom
            protesting U.S. relations with Franco. Also included in this series are several of
            Martin's address books (with loose notes and lists of addresses) and a number of
            business cards of contacts and friends in many countries.</p>

            Mission, including a donation booklet; and bibliographic sources on the Spanish Civil
            War.</p>
          <p>General materials on veterans and VALB are located in this series. The VALB files span
            the late 1940s through the 1980s. Particularly noteworthy are questionnaires sent by
            Martin and filled out by 36 veterans who were treated for wounds in Spain; memos,
            reports and clippings related to VALB and the Subversive Activities Control Board;
            programs and materials from VALB's 40th anniversary event honoring women; and notes and
            statements clarifying the relationship between VALB and Medical Bureau personnel.</p>
          <p>Much of this series is given over to the copious research notes Martin took at various
            repositories, chiefly at the New York Public Library and Columbia University. Martin
            obtained thousands of pages of photocopies from Columbia University's Spanish Refugee
            and Relief Organization (SRRO) collection in her efforts to document the administrative
            history of the Medical Bureau. [Note: These photocopies have been retained, however
            permission to publish these photocopied materials must be obtained in writing from
            Columbia University's Librarian for Rare Books and Manuscripts].</p>
          <p>The correspondence between Martin and Brandeis University archivist Victor Berch, who
            provided extensive research assistance to Martin, is a useful source of information on
            the course of her work, and on the establishment of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives
            at Brandeis. This series also includes many files of articles Martin clipped from the
            Cuernavaca papers (chiefly in Spanish with some English), mostly on politics and culture
            in Spain during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>

            Brandeis University initially inventoried the Fredericka Martin collection in 1991, five

            retained. These boxes, which were transferred to New York University in January 2001,
            are shelved with the processed manuscript materials in Boxes 32-36; they are available
