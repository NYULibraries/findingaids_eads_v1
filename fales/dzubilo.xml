            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Chloe Faith Dzubilo (1960-2011) was an artist and AIDS and transgender activist.</p>
            <p>Dzubilo moved to New York City from Connecticut in 1982, working at Studio 54 before becoming the advertising director at the East Village Eye. She wrote for and performed with the Blacklips Performance Cult at the Pyramid club and edited the group's zine, Leif Sux, and was in the band Transisters. In 1987 she was diagnosed with HIV when Bobby Bradley, her partner of nine years and founder of the Pyramid Club, died of AIDS. Following her diagnosis, Dzubilo advocated for civil rights, adequate health care and dignity for people living with HIV/AIDS, transgendered people, and drug users.</p>
            <p>Dzubilo studied art at the Parsons School of Design and received an associate degree in Gender Studies from the City University of New York City College in 1999. She served on New York City's LGBT Community Center's Gender Identity Project transgender HIV prevention team, conducting prevention outreach; spoke at conferences and in video Public Service Announcements, and gave workshops for health care and mental health providers. Dzubilo was involved with the political action group the Transsexual Menace, and went on to direct one of the first federally funded HIV prevention programs for transgender sex workers in 1997.</p>
            <p>In 2001, Dzubilo founded the Equi-Aid Project, a Manhattan-based program that specifically helps children who are infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS, as well as other at-risk youth. In 2003, Dzubilo was appointed to the HIV and Human Service Planning Council of New York, an advisory body composed of people living with HIV/AIDS, service providers, and government representatives, charged with ensuring that "people living with HIV have access to appropriate, quality services across the continuum of care, resulting in the best possible health and quality of life."</p>
            <p>Dzubilo died on February 18, 2011.</p>
