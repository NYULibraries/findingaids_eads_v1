            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">The Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, Local 1-S Department Store Workers Union had its origins in efforts to organize the workers of Macy's department store in New York City. These efforts finally came to with the passage of the Wagner Act in 1935 and the establishment of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1938. The union made its first gains among non-selling departments of Macy's in the late 1930s, but by 1943, 54% of the salesclerks voted for union representation. Originally affiliated with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), in the wake of the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, Local 1-S seceded from the RWDSU but re-affiliated in 1955. Most of the material in this collection relates to the 40th Anniversary Exhibits for Local 1-S (1978) and for Local 3, Bloomingdale's, another department store local (1979). Oversized materials include panoramic shots of shop stewards conferences and a luncheon. In addition, Local 1-S scholarship recipients are pictured.</abstract>

            <p>The Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, Local 1-S Department Store Workers Union had its origins in efforts to organize the workers of Macy's department store in New York City. These efforts came to fruition with with the passage of the Wagner Act in 1935 and the establishment of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1938. Sam Kovenetsky was chosen to head the organizing drive. He began to work full-time for the union, along with other organizers including Marcella Loring and Bill Goltz. The union made its first gains among non-selling departments of Macy's inthe late 1930s, but by 1943, 54% of the salesclerks voted for union representation. Through negotiations, Local 1-S bargained for employee benefits and for language that eliminated racial and religious discrimination. Originally affiliated with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), in the wake of the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, Local 1-S and other left-wing locals seceded from the RWDSU but by 1955, 1-S re-affiliated with RWDSU.</p>
