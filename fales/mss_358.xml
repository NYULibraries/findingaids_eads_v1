    <abstract id="aspace_6e1d50dd3a548b0ae28f975a02d0ebb2">American Beat poet Herschel Silverman (1926-2015) was strongly influenced by jazz music and other Beat writers. He read and wrote poetry well into his 80s.
Poet Theodore Enslin (1925-2011) published over 80 books of poetry in his career. He lived the majority of his life in rural Maine, where he farmed and wrote until he passed away at the age of 86.
This collection contains correspondence between Herschel Silverman and Theodore Enslin during the later part of their lives, beginning in 1994 until Enslin's death in 2011. Topics include responses to each other's writings, world events, health, friends, and family. These topics illustrate the long-term friendships of this generation of writers, as they moved into old age and faced challenges both professionally and personally.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>American Beat poet Herschel Silverman (1926-2015) owned a sweet shop/luncheonette called Hersch’s Beehive, in Bayonne, New Jersey for 34 years, while also writing, publishing, and performing poetry at New York clubs. His involvement in Beat culture led to long-lasting friendships with other writers, including Allen Ginsberg and Theodore Enslin. Silverman read and wrote new poetry well into his 80s, and was considered a role model for writers in his New Jersey community.</p><p>Poet Theodore Enslin (1925-2011) lived most of his adult life in rural Maine, while farming and writing poetry. He published over 80 books of poetry, wrote an award-winning newspaper column, and wrote a play produced in New York. Enslin passed away in Maine at the age of 86.</p><p>Sources: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11917494/Herschel-Silverman-Beat-poet-obituary.html</p><p>http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/02/nyregion/poetry-a-beat-poet-behind-the-candy-counter.html</p><p>https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/theodore-enslin</p><p>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/30/theodore-enslin</p>  </bioghist>
