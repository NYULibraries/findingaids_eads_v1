The papers also include files related to Walter’s work as Press Secretary for Robert Morgenthau’s 1962 campaign for New York State governor and as the first Director of Public Information for the newly-formed New York City Department of Highways in 1963-1964. The papers also hold a broad range of New York City-oriented print matter, such as city government reports and local newsletters.

            <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
            <p>Henry (Hank) Walter (1927-2016) joined New York City Comptroller Abraham D. Beame’s staff in September 1970 as Assistant to the Comptroller for Public Relations. In this capacity he wrote speeches for Beame, as well as press releases and messages to groups, and handled select correspondence on public relations matters.</p>
            <p>After attending St. Joseph’s College and Fordham University, and a stint in the Army, Walter’s professional career began in 1953 as a copy boy with the 
                <emph render="italic">New York World-Telegram</emph>. He became a reporter for the newspaper, first on civil service issues, then covering City Hall. He left the 
                <emph render="italic">World-Telegram</emph> in August 1962 to become Press Secretary for gubernatorial candidate Robert Morgenthau. In January 1963, Walter became the first Director of Public Information for the newly-formed New York City Department of Highways. He left the Department in March 1964, joining WMCA Radio as Director of Editorial Research, and was later promoted to Director of Public Affairs for Straus Broadcasting Group, of which WMCA was a part.</p>
            <p>Walter left WMCA in mid-1970 and was hired on to Beame’s staff by his Executive Assistant, Dominick R. Peluso, who was a former reporter himself and knew Walter from their years on the City Hall beat for rival papers. Peluso left Beame’s staff in January 1972 for a job with the Queens Public Administrator, and he was replaced by Ed Katcher, another former reporter. In November 1973, Beame won New York’s mayoral election, and Walter stayed on as a speechwriter for Mayor Beame with the title of Special Assistant to the Mayor. In this position, Walter reported to Press Secretary Sidney J. Frigand and worked with other speechwriters and public relations staff, including the future Lincoln scholar, Harold Holzer.</p>
            <p>Abraham D. Beame (1906-2001) was a graduate of the City College of New York and a Certified Public Accountant who began working for the city’s budget bureau in 1946. Beame was first elected Comptroller in 1962. He left the office in 1965 to run for mayor on the Democratic Party ticket. He lost that election to John V. Lindsay, but returned to public service four years later in January 1970 upon his re-election as Comptroller. In the next election cycle, Beame again ran for mayor, winning this time. He was inaugurated on January 1, 1974. Although his mayoralty had moments of celebration, such as the events surrounding the 1976 Bicentennial of the United States’ Declaration of Independence, Beame’s tenure was marked more by fiscal crises (including the threat of bankruptcy), crime (including the Son of Sam serial murders), the failure to deliver basic services (including the power black-out of 1977), and other troubles. Beame ran for re-election in the mayoral campaign of 1977, but lost in the Democratic Party primary.</p>
            <p>As Beame’s days in office came to a close, Walter transferred in November 1977 to work as a speechwriter for Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, a position he held until 1989 when Goldin left the Comptrollership after a failed effort to win that year’s mayoral election.</p>

            <p>The Henry Walter papers primarily include Walter’s working files from his years as an assistant for public relations matters, especially in connection with speechwriting, for New York City Comptroller (1970-1973) and Mayor (1974-1977) Abraham (Abe) D. Beame. The files include press releases, drafts and final versions of speeches/remarks, mayoral messages/greetings to constituent and other groups, daily press schedules, briefing memos on appearances (e.g., other attendees, important background information, logistics), invitations for Beame to attend events and programs or other documents related to those events, internal memos, city government agency reports, and other materials related to Beame’s public appearances and communications. The collection also holds the public relations work Walter did for Robert Morgenthau during his campaign for New York Governor in 1962, the press releases Walter prepared for the newly-formed Department on Highways in 1963-1964, and other work Walter did in the 1990s.</p>
            <p>The collection holds a rich set of documents related to the Inner Circle annual political parody show. These include programs for all years from 1956 to 1999 and many from 2001-2014, along with seating charts, invitations, tickets, and other documents. Finally, the collection holds an idiosyncratic mix of newsletters, newspapers, commemorative booklets, and other print material on economic, political and cultural matters from the 1950s to 2001.</p>
            <p>The collection also holds Walter’s files from his work from November 1977 to 1989 for Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, but those files are not currently open to research in accordance with the conditions of the collection’s donation.</p>

                    <p>The series includes Henry Walter’s files from his years as an assistant for public relations matters, especially in connection with speechwriting, for Comptroller (1970-1973) and Mayor (1974-1977) Abraham (Abe) D. Beame. The series generally includes three types of content: press releases from Beame’s office and other public statements made by Beame; working files underlying Walter’s public relations activities; and newspaper clippings. The working files include drafts and final versions of speeches/remarks, messages/greetings, daily press schedules, press releases, proclamations, briefing memos on appearances (e.g., other attendees, important background information, logistics), invitations for Beame to attend events and programs or other documents related to those events, internal memos, Walter’s timesheets and daily to-do lists, city government agency reports, and other materials related to Beame’s public appearances and communications. The subject matter primarily concerns city finances, politics, crime, drug abuse, and other such broad issues facing Beame, but also concerns specific events such as the celebration of the nation’s bicentennial in 1976 and the power outage/black-out of 1977.</p>
                    <p>The series also includes some documents, including original correspondence, from the 1960s primarily related to Beame’s positions on tax and revenue public policy matters, and some material from Beame’s post-mayoralty years.</p>

                        <p>The subseries primarily includes Henry Walter’s files from his years as Assistant to the Comptroller for Public Relations, from September 1970 to the end of Abraham (Abe) Beame’s tenure as Comptroller at December 31, 1973. The subseries generally includes three types of content: press releases from Beame’s office and other public statements made by Beame; working files underlying Walter’s public relations activities; and newspaper clippings. The subseries also includes some documents, including original correspondence, from the 1960s primarily related to Beame’s positions on tax and revenue public policy matters; these pre-date Walter’s involvement with Beame and likely were given to Walter in connection with his public relations responsibilities.</p>
                        <p>Press releases are found as four bound annual volumes for 1970-1973 and as unbound, foldered documents for the same years. The two sets appear to be largely identical. One important known exception is that the unbound documents include the press releases issued separately during Beame’s 1973 mayoral campaign and the transition period after his election. In addition to press releases, these documents include other forms of public relations material, such as speeches, remarks, messages, and the like. The sets each have “indexes,” which include a table of contents indicating date and subject matter of the documents. The bulk of the topics concern financial matters, such as bond sales, budgets, New York City's credit rating, governmental unit reorganizations and appointments, mass transit fares, expenses (e.g., Board of Education deficits, process for awarding management consultant contracts), and housing construction. Many of the topics, though financial in emphasis, have broader implications as well, such as drug addiction/drug abuse, the city's costs related to United Nations operations, home rule legislation in the state, proposed Manhattan House of Detention (Tombs) prison annex, and the Yankee Stadium renovation. There are also topics concerning national legislation (e.g., wage and price controls) and international matters, especially with respect to Israel (e.g., support for Soviet Jews, call for a UN investigation into Arab guerilla sabotage against people flying in and out of Israel, providing military jet planes to Israel, remarks at memorial services for the slain Israeli Olympic team members).</p>
                        <p>Working files include a mix of documents, including drafts of speeches and press releases (including unused material), Beame’s daily public schedules, carbon copies of outgoing correspondence over Beame’s or Walter’s signature, Walter’s to-do lists, notes, and time records, clippings, and reports issued by the Comptroller’s Office and other print matter, including the employee newsletter 
                            <emph render="italic">The Comptroller</emph>. One file includes the development of Beame’s mayoral candidacy announcement, with Walter’s observations on the events of that time (March 1973). Threaded throughout the files are glimpses of Walter himself, including carbon copies of short letters to his mother or to friends and professional colleagues. Most of these files are structured chronologically, with all matters from a given period of time (typically one month) filed together. A few files are subject-oriented and include correspondence, press releases, and other documents related to particular topics. These include a compendium of mayoral candidate Beame’s campaign promises and documents related to the efforts of one Abraham Broza to collect signatures on petitions in support of certain of Beame’s positions. These files also include Beame’s correspondence with state and city officials from the late 1960s, that is, prior to his comptrollership, concerning his positions on tax and revenue reform measures.</p>
                        <p>The files of clippings include mostly photocopies of articles from the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, 
                            <emph render="italic">Daily News</emph>, 
                            <emph render="italic">Post</emph>, and other newspapers that concern Beame and New York City issues of interest to Walter as Beame’s public relations assistant. The files are especially extensive for 1973 and include the coverage of Beame’s mayoralty campaign.</p>

                        <p>The subseries of public relations files for the mayoralty years primarily includes Henry Walter's working materials as a speechwriter for Mayor Abraham Beame. The files include drafts and final versions of speeches/remarks, messages/greetings, daily press schedules, press releases, proclamations, briefing memos on appearances (e.g., other attendees, important background information, logistics), invitations for Beame to attend events and programs or other documents related to those events, executive orders, local law public hearing packages, clippings, internal memos, and other materials related to Beame’s public appearances and communications. Subject matter ranges from general issues facing Beame, such as crime, politics, and business/investment climate, to specific concerns of the time, such as the city’s fiscal crisis of 1975, celebration of the nation’s bicentennial in 1976, the city's hosting of the Democratic National Convention in 1976, and the power outage/black-out of 1977. Files from the early months of 1977, during which time Beame ran for re-election as Mayor, include some memos and summaries related to political campaign messaging, but generally there are no extensive campaign-issued documents here. Some files include reports and other print matter and these are noted at the folder level in the container list below. Indexes to speeches/remarks given by Beame are available in the files; these tend to emphasize the group to or occasion on which Beame spoke, not the subject matter. The subseries also holds a small amount of material, such as clippings and reunion plans, relating to Beame but dating from his post-mayoralty years.</p>

                    <p>The series includes documents, much of which was prepared by Henry Walter, of a public relations nature for various public figures, other than Abraham Beame and Harrison Goldin. Most notably, these include Walter's files as Press Secretary for Robert M. Morgenthau during Morgenthau's campaign for Governor of New York in 1962. These files include press releases, speeches and remarks, drafts, correspondence, schedules, and campaign travel arrangements. The series also includes press releases issued by Walter in his capacity as the Director of Public Information for the newly-formed New York City Department of Highways (1963-64). Also from the 1960s is a folder of campaign brochures and other ephemera related to former reporter and Democratic candidate Martin J. Steadman's campaign for Congress from the 4th Congressional District (1966), with a letter from Steadman to Walter thanking him for his help and support during the campaign.</p>
                    <p>The series also includes a small amount of speechwriting done by Walter in the 1990s. These include drafts of remarks concerning retirement financial security by Cuyler Findlay of the AARP Investment Program at Scudder Investor Services (1991) and work Walter did for former Westchester County Executive Alfred DelBello, including drafts of a speech and an article on the international transboundary movement of hazardous waste (1990), business and jobs (1992), and for a public affairs program on Cablevision focused on crime and punishment (1993).</p>
                    <p>The series includes a small amount of miscellaneous documents concerning Walter himself, including his 1960 remarks to the Air Pollution Control Association on the topic "The Role of Public Media"; a guest pass to the 1964 New York State Democratic Convention; his 1970 resume; a letter leading to his hiring on to Comptroller Beame's staff; two family photographs; an "I Care" lapel pin; and other documents.</p>

                    <p>Formed in 1922, the Inner Circle of New York Political Journalists (known commonly as the Inner Circle) is an organization of New York City political reporters and journalists that performs an annual amateur parody show lampooning city, state and national political figures. The show is a fundraiser for charity and has become a major event in which political figures, including the mayor of New York, now commonly perform. Henry Walter was a member and collected materials from the annual shows and those documents form this series.</p>
                    <p>The series includes the programs from the annual Inner Circle shows for every year from 1956 to 1999. For the 2000s, programs are missing from 2000, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013; the final year in the series is 2014. The programs include satirical cover art illustrating the theme of the year's show (which is often linked to a current pop cultural reference), the cast of characters and the performers, the lyrics to the show's many musical numbers, and reference to the commonly-recognized tune to which the lyrics were sung. For most years, the seating chart for the event is also included. The series also holds other documents for many of the years, including dress rehearsal programs (the dress rehearsal was held before the main event for members, family and friends), invitations/flyers (bearing the program's cover art), tickets to the dress rehearsal or President's reception, some scripts, and some miscellaneous documents, such as invitations to members to attend Inner Circle meetings.</p>

                    <p>The series is arranged with the New York City directories first, followed by other print matter. The other print matter is arranged in the numerical sequence (1-255) of the items as found in the inventory provided by a member of Henry Walter’s family. This sequence is generally chronological, except that some oversize items from the 1980s are found at the end of the list. Copies of the detailed inventory are found in the two boxes that hold the other print matter.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                    <p>The series includes a diverse and idiosyncratic mix of printed materials dating from the 1950s to 2001, though mostly from the 1970s and 1980s. Very generally, the material concerns economic, political, cultural, and public policy matters. Most of the materials were created by New York City-based organizations, concern New York City matters, and seem targeted to a New York City audience, but some are of state-wide or national scope. The bulk of the series includes some form of periodical, especially newsletters, newspapers, magazines, and series of technical or policy reports. But with few exceptions there are no extended runs of any of the individual titles; most titles are represented by only a few issues, often only the first number of the title. Aside from periodicals, the series holds a variety of single issue documents of interest, such as commemorative booklets, souvenir programs, annual reports, calendars of events, publicity materials, and the like.</p>
                    <p>Newsletters perhaps form most of the series. These newsletters were created by government agencies, or groups within those agencies, for internal distribution or for the general public; public policy interest groups; political figures; commercial institutions; trade associations; and other organizations. There are also many small newspapers created for distribution within a specific New York City neighborhood, organization, or constituency.</p>
                    <p>A detailed list of the printed material was provided by the donor’s family and is housed with the documents. The container list below summarizes most of these items at the folder level.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these miscellaneous printed material the series also includes several New York City official directories, known as the “Green Book,” from the 1950s to the 1980s used by Henry Walter.</p>
