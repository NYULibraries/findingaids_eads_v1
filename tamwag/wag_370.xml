    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>ACT-UAW Local 7902 (Adjuncts Come Together, in some early contracts they also have gone by Academics Coming Together) represents over 4,000 part-time and adjunct teachers at the New School and New York University. The union was formed in 2002 by adjuncts at NYU, which first ratified their first contract in 2004 and elected their first executive officers in 2005. In 2004, adjuncts at the New School began to negotiate, and reached an agreement with the New School in 2005. The union has successfully negotiated better pay, job security, partially subsidized health care, pension benefits, and promoted transparency within the universities' budgetary systems. In 2015, Tandon adjuncts voted yes for union representation.</p><p>In 2015, academic student workers at the New School began organizing under Local 7902. In 2017, they voted to form a union and went on strike in 2018. They won a contract with the New School. During the COVID-19 pandemic, New School part-time faculty voted to ratify a pandemic recovery plan. In 2022, contract negotiations began for New School and New York University adjunct teachers.</p><p>In 2022-2023, contract faculty at New York University began organizing for NYU administration to recognize their union.</p>  </bioghist>
