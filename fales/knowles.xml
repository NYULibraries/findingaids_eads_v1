            <abstract id="ref363" label="Abstract">The Christopher Knowles Papers contain material relating to the personal and professional life of visual and performing artist Christopher Knowles. Born in Brooklyn, NY in 1959, Knowles connected with avant-garde artist Robert Wilson at age 14, after Wilson heard a tape of Knowles speaking the words of his poem "Emily Likes the TV." They collaborated on many performances pieces, most notably "Einstein on the Beach." Knowles has performed internationally and has had his artwork exhibited in both joint and solo shows at galleries including, but not limited to, the Holly Solomon Gallery, Gavin Brown's Enterprise and the Museum of Modern Art. He continues to live and work in Brooklyn.</abstract>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Born in Brooklyn in 1959, Christopher Knowles is an artist who works within a variety of mediums including performance, poetry, paintings and what are called “typings,” visual pieces created using a typewriter, most commonly with the letter “c” for “Christopher”. In 1973, at the age of 14, Knowles was approached by avant-garde theater director and artist Robert Wilson, who had heard a tape of Knowles reciting his piece, “Emily Loves the TV” and hoped to collaborate with Knowles. Knowles went, with his parents, to a performance of Wilson’s “The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin,” where Wilson brought Knowles on stage to perform what would become Knowles’ piece, “Emily Likes the TV.” This was the beginning of a long friendship which would lead them to collaborate many times over the years, most famously in 1976 on “Einstein on the Beach,” which was also in collaboration with composer Philip Glass and choreographer Lucinda Childs. Knowles lived in Wilson’s SoHo loft and art studio for a time, working with the Byrd Hoffman School of Byrd’s, Wilson’s art and performance collective. Other collaborative work included performances with Cindy Lubar and Richard Kostelanetz.</p>
            <p>Knowles has had a number of joint and solo shows of his visual art at the Kitchen, the Holly Solomon Gallery, the Byrd Hoffman Studio, Gavin Brown’s Enterprise, the Museum of Modern Art and the Louvre. The Museum of Modern Art acquired some of Knowles’ Typings in 2013. Knowles continues to live and work in New York City and travels widely to perform.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The collection contains material pertaining to Knowles professional work as an artist. However, much of that work was done as a young adolescent, which is reflected throughout the collection. His journals are a repository for his artwork as well as his personal life and contain reflections of his exhibited or performed art. There is material relating to the many performances in which he took part, including programs, press, reviews, source material, scripts, photographs and publicity. Some of the performances include "Einstein on the Beach," "The $ Value of Man," "A Letter for Queen Victoria," "Dialog/Curious George," and "Parzival." Many of these were collaborations with Robert Wilson. In addition to the paper material related to his performances, there are video and sound recordings of shows, as well as recordings that Knowles used as a part of his performances.</p>
            <p>Knowles produced a large portfolio of paintings and drawings in addition to his performance art. The collection includes material documenting his exhibitions, both domestic and international, including press, gallery cards, exhibit catalogs and correspondence. There are photographs of his exhibited work, as well as slides, in addition to marker, pen and crayon drawings. Notably, Knowles created what are called "Typings," made with a typewriter and most commonly using the letter "c" to create designs and images. This collection contains quite a few typings, as well as typewritten poetry and some prose.</p>
            <p>Correspondence includes letters, cards and postcards both sent and received by Knowles. Notable correspondence includes Jasper Johns, John Cage, Robert Wilson and Cindy Lubar. Knowles also designed and created a large number of birthday and father's day cards, as well as invitations to his shows and his own birthday parties.</p>
            <p>Photographs include many taken of Knowles and his family, as well of images of his art. There are photographs of performances and rehearsals, international exhibits and shows, in addition to family vacations and his home in Brooklyn. There is a small amount of material relating to Knowles' personal life, including medical and educational information and resumes.</p>

                    <p>This series contains journals and sketchbooks filled by Christopher Knowles. Many contain work referencing larger complete artworks, such as "Curious George," which was a collaboration with Robert Wilson. Done mostly in marker or pen, the journals also include many of Knowles "Top Ten" song lists, which he created listening to WABC DJs. Occasionally, the journals contain typewritten text that was then tapped into the blank book. There are also two books created by Knowles as a young child, with the aid of a parent, using text, drawing and photographs. Additionally, a few of the journals include additions by collaborator Cindy Lubar and Robert Wilson.</p>

Subseries A contains material for performances to which Knowles contributed directly. Subseries B contains material relating to performances in which Knowles was not immediately involved.</p>

                    <p>This series contains material relating to Christopher Knowles' performance art. This includes programs, photographs, source material and posters, as well as some correspondence and press. Many of these performances were written by or originally conceived by others, most prominently Robert Wilson, but Knowles often contributed text or set design, if he was not performing in the piece itself.</p>

                    <p>This series contains original art by Christopher Knowles. This includes drawings and typings as well as poetry and prose. Some of the material relates to completed works of art like his collaboration with Robert Wilson, "Dialog/Curious George," as well as a few pieces that were exhibited in galleries. However, the majority of the material exists independently and should not necessarily be considered complete artworks.</p>

                    <p>This series contains a small amount of material that is not directly related to Christopher Knowles' professional life as an artist. Most material dates from early childhood to adolescence and includes medical material such as neurological exams, as well as information concerning his early education. The only exception to this is the "biography file" which contains resumes in addition to material concerning his family and friends.</p>

Much of the material was used in Knowles performances and are recordings of his own voice, recordings he made off the television and radio, or of ambient noise. There are also sound recordings of his performances.</p>
