    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Hundreds of workers lost their jobs when the Taystee Bakery in Flushing, Queens shut down in 1992. Citing the expense of operating in New York City, the bakery's parent company, Stroehmann Bakeries, moved to Pennsylvania. </p><p>Many of the workers at the now defunct Taystee Bakery joined forces in an attempt to create New York City's first worker-owned commercial bakery. By the fall of 1994, the Community/Labor Campaign to Save Taystee Jobs, Inc. had secured over $250,000 from banks, foundations, and religious organizations. Led by former Taystee workers Lynn Bell and Jennie Call, the nonprofit (sometimes referred to as the New York Bakery Project before the group's official incorporation) focused on finding a site for the new bakery and seeking out investment and partnership opportunities.</p>  </bioghist>
