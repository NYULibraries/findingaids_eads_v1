            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can lead to acquired deficiency syndrome (AIDS), was thought to have begun in New York City’s gay communities in the early 1980s, due in part because of the large number of gay men who lost their lives during the 1980s and early 1990s to the illness. During this time, death was a common outcome. Over the same period, it came to be understood that the illness did not originate with homosexuals, nor was it only impacting them. In early 1992, Gay Men's Health Crisis reported that statewide, over 40,000 citizens had been diagnosed with AIDS. An additional 360,000 more had contracted HIV by that time, as estimated by New York State's Department of Health.</p>
            <p>Brooklyn Historical Society began preparing the exhibition 
                <emph render="italic">AIDS/Brooklyn</emph> in 1991. David M. Kahn, executive director of BHS at that time, had lost his lover Ron Wogaman to an AIDS-related illness earlier that year. With a goal of documenting the crisis in Brooklyn through the material culture, personal narratives and life histories of those living with HIV/AIDS, BHS opened the exhibition in April of 1993. The exhibition not only informed of the experience of people living with the virus, but told of the precipitating factors and collateral effects; the strain on their neighbors, friends and family members, practices and attitudes with regard to drug use and sex, prejudice and discrimination in communities, and activist responses. Until that time, only art exhibitions had been inspired by the calamity of HIV/AIDS. In the museum establishment, BHS was seen as having pushed the boundaries of what an AIDS exhibition could do.</p>
            <p>Simultaneous with the exhibition, the borough of Brooklyn had an estimated 35,000 cases of HIV. There, as in the rest of the nation, the disease had disproportionately affected the African-American and Latino/a communities along with the gay community. Brooklyn, however, was experiencing demographic shifts in the spread of AIDS that differed from the considerable high-impact zone of Manhattan. The disease was impacting women and children in Kings County; over 1800 women were infected in 1992, according to the city's AIDS Surveillance Unit.</p>
            <p>Nationwide, estimated deaths from AIDS peaked in 1995; over 50,000 U.S. residents died that year. Due primarily to multi-drug treatment and lowering infection rates, the number has declined ever since. However, due in part to minimal cultural awareness and dissemination of HIV/AIDS information in impacted communities, that decline has been uneven across different demographic groups.</p>

            <p>The AIDS/Brooklyn Oral History Project collection includes oral histories conducted for an exhibition undertaken by the Brooklyn Historical Society in 1993. The project attempted to document the impact of the AIDS epidemic on Brooklyn communities. Recordings initially made on magnetic tape concerned the epidemic and were with narrators who had firsthand experience with the crisis in their communities, families and personal life. Narrators came from diverse backgrounds within Brooklyn and the New York metropolitan area and had unique experiences which connected them with HIV/AIDS. Substantive topics of hemophilia, sexual behavior, substance abuse, medical practice, social work, homelessness, activism, childhood, relationships and parenting run through at least one, and often several, of the oral histories in the collection.</p>

            <head>Arrangement note</head>
            <p>The AIDS/Brooklyn Oral History Project collection is organized into four series based on format.</p>
            <p>• 
                <emph render="bolditalic">Series 1: Oral Histories</emph> consists of digitized oral history interview recordings. The series of oral histories was largely arranged alphabetically by the narrator's last name.</p>
            <p>• 
                <emph render="bolditalic">Series 2: Oral History Transcripts</emph> includes transcripts of several interviews, also arranged alphabetically by narrator's last name. Interview abstracts are located in the "Summaries" folder in box 1.</p>
            <p>• 
                <emph render="bolditalic">Series 3: Research Materials</emph> is made from what was gathered and generated through the oral history project and exhibition. The materials relate directly to the AIDS epidemic in Brooklyn, as well as to AIDS/HIV in the New York metropolitan area. This series includes magazines, books, pamphlets, articles, biographies, a radio program and resource lists. The research materials are located in three boxes and one binder.</p>
            <p>• 
                <emph render="bolditalic">Series 4: Magnetic Tapes</emph> consists of oral history interview recordings on original videotape and audiotape recordings and duplicate audiotape recordings. The oral history tapes are labeled with narrator names and interview dates, and arranged in an arbitrary order in two boxes.</p>

            <head>Oral History note</head>
            <p>Oral history interviews are intimate conversations between two people, both of whom have generously agreed to share these recordings with the Brooklyn Historical Society archives and with researchers. Please listen in the spirit with which these were shared. Researchers will understand that:</p>
            <p>1. The Brooklyn Historical Society abides by the General Principles &amp; Best Practices for Oral History as agreed upon by the Oral History Association (2009) and expects that use of this material will be done with respect for these professional ethics.</p>
            <p>2. Every oral history relies on the memories, views and opinions of the narrator. Because of the personal nature of oral history, listeners may find some viewpoints or language of the recorded participants to be objectionable. In keeping with its mission of preservation and unfettered access whenever possible, BHS presents these views as recorded.</p>
            <p>3. Transcripts created prior to 2008 serve as a guide to the interview and are not considered verbatim. The audio recording should be considered the primary source for each interview. It may contain natural false starts, verbal stumbles, misspeaks, repetitions that are common in conversation, and other passages and phrases omitted from the transcript. This decision was made because BHS gives primacy to the audible voice and also because some researchers do find useful information in these verbal patterns.</p>
            <p>4. Unless these verbal patterns are germane to your scholarly work, when quoting from this material researchers are encouraged to correct the grammar and make other modifications maintaining the flavor of the narrator’s speech while editing the material for the standards of print.</p>

                    <p>Melinda Broman, a White woman, was forty-seven years old when she was interviewed. Her husband Victor Ockey, who was a hemophiliac, died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1989. He was infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) during a routine blood transfusion in the early 1980s. At the time of this interview, Broman had lived in Brooklyn's Cobble Hill neighborhood since the mid-1980s. Broman's involvement with AIDS was extensive, reaching beyond her relationship with her husband. As a member of the National Hemophiliac Association she has lobbied for increased awareness of the specific plight of HIV+ hemophiliacs. Through her work as a psychologist at Downstate Medical Center and as a member of the Brooklyn Psychological Association she has organized AIDS workshops. She was interviewed primarily because of her personal and professional experience with AIDS issues specific to hemophiliacs.</p>

                    <p>In the interview, Melinda Broman was able to provide a lot of information about what it was to be a heterosexual woman within a straight relationship dealing with HIV/AIDS. She speaks about the lack of support within the AIDS movement and also the lack of support from the hemophiliac community. While Broman found herself often surrounded by gay men within the AIDS movement, she made friends but was not always getting the support she needed. It was different within the hemophiliac community. She felt that fear of HIV/AIDS made the virus an unwanted topic of discussion. Melinda also speaks about being in a serodiscordant couple, the feelings she had about that, and how it related to her dealing with her own non-HIV-related health issues. Interview conducted by Robert Sember.</p>

                    <p>Philip Coleman was fifty-two at the time of the interview in 1992. A gay African-American person with AIDS (PWA), he was born in Harlem, New York, lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan for many years and was living alone in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn. Coleman was a member of Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) and, before he became ill, he used to conduct sensitivity training for volunteers working with gay African-Americans. In 1992, he participated in a HIV positive support group for gay men in Brooklyn. Being gay was Coleman's primary identification. He had been ill for some time and had previously been hospitalized with respiratory and circulation ailments shortly before this interview.</p>

                    <p>In the interview Phil Coleman provides a clear sense of the impact that AIDS has had on the black gay community and on his life. He speaks candidly about what love, sex and relationships have come to mean to him as a PWA. Based on the experiences he had in his support group, he was able to make a few general observations about gay PWAs living in Brooklyn. Coleman shares throughout the interview his thoughts and feelings rooted in the intersectional experience of being Black, gay and living with HIV. He applies his analysis to what was needed in terms of activism, and services, and how racism and homophobia play out in church, in community and elsewhere. Throughout the interview Coleman connects the work he does around his being a gay Black man living with HIV to issues such as ageism, the house music and ballroom dance scenes, and even overlapping activism as it related to Haiti.

                    <p>In the interview as a family, Beverly Rotter, Melissa De La Cruz and Randy Rotter discuss Iris De La Cruz (1954 - 1991) and the powerful mark she made on the world as an AIDS activist, sex worker activist, and writer. They talk about her life and work before HIV and after. Each one remarks in their own way about Iris’ humor, kindness and fierceness as an activist. Melissa talks about what it was to have Iris as her mother. Randy discusses what it was to bond with Iris through humor, and also his anger around her HIV infection. Beverly speaks frankly about being a caregiver and the work that it takes to advocate for someone. Each also speaks about their own understanding of HIV/AIDS before Iris seroconverted (when HIV antibodies are detected) and after. Continuing to do the work of railing against stigma and discrimination, at one point Beverly asserts that the interviewer’s line of questioning is inappropriate and lets him know she will not continue in that direction.

                    <p>At the time of the 1993 interview, Kristy Fernandes was a seven year old girl who had been diagnosed with AIDS two years prior. Carney Fernandes, her father, was at this time age fifty-five. An immigrant from Guyana, he had tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and had been caring for his daughter on his own since her mother's death in the late 1980s. An articulate girl and keenly aware of her situation, Kristy was able to keep up with her school work and had only minor limitations on her daily life. Her father was very knowledgeable about developments regarding AIDS at the time of the interview and was very active in her care. Upon learning of his daughter's HIV status he went back to school to become a nurse. They lived together in an apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>

He was interviewed as a teenaged "activist" after asking PRY for suggestions for one of their high school educators. He worked two afternoons a week; going to high schools, churches, and youth groups, etc., with other teens to conduct workshops on AIDS awareness and safer sex practices. He had no prior personal experience with AIDS, making him distinctly different from most of the other people interviewed for the project. Hargrove went on to serve as director of Project S.A.F.E., circa 2006.</p>

He speaks frankly about his own ideas and judgments about people most impacted by the virus, as well as how proud he is of the level of AIDS awareness among Brooklyn youth. In the interview he mentions some urban myths that surround HIV and what he would like to see the community and the government doing in response to HIV. He also discusses how different members of his family respond to his work, including his brother who also works with Project S.A.F.E. Not living with HIV himself, and having only met relatively healthy people with the virus, Hargrove has a specific view on the epidemic. Interview conducted by Robert Rosenberg.</p>

                    <p>A gay African-American, Christopher Henry found that he was HIV positive four years before this interview. That discovery was weeks before his gay cousin died from AIDS. He moved from his family home in the Bronx into his cousin's house in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1991. Apart from attending support groups at Woodhull Hospital, Henry was not then involved with AIDS-related organizations or activities. Henry did not consider himself an activist per se, as he did not carry banners. Instead, Henry saw himself more as a public intellectual in the making, akin to a celebrity or "public official." He was close to family, had a sense of community, and was raised with a Christian foundation.</p>

                    <p>In the interview, Christopher Henry speaks of AIDS in the interview from the position of a young urban gay man of color; conscious of the role race and ethnicity play in understanding the issues raised by the AIDS crisis. When addressing his personal experience with the virus, whether he is describing his mother's reaction to his status or presenting anecdotes from his interactions with his gay friends, he is particularly forceful and articulate. Henry provides insights into the views of people impacted by HIV in Brooklyn related to the systemic issues of HIV/AIDS. He speaks about HIV being created by the government as well as how the government's inaction impacts care. He talks about the ignorance he sees within his own Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights. He also shares a point of view about the virus that brings together spirituality, gay rights, and race awareness. Interview conducted by Robert Sember.</p>

                    <p>In the interview, Marilyn John speaks extensively on the changes she has witnessed within the Caribbean communities, particularly with regards to sexuality, because of the AIDS crisis. John brings to the conversation her experience from within the Caribbean community, as well as a background and interest in community health. Throughout the course of the interview, John talks about the need for a holistic approach to health (Holistic Methods of Intervention), specifically with a focus on culture and immigration. She also speaks specifically on the need for Caribbean specific cultural training related to HIV. Since her primary interest and expertise is in education, she concentrates on the different approaches she takes to the different needs and characteristics of many of the communities she works with. Finally, she outlines what should be done for Brooklyn's Caribbean communities. Interview conducted by Robert Sember.</p>

Ripp speaks specifically about his understanding of HIV/AIDS as a gay man. Both reflect on being near Michael when he died. Morissey recalls how she came to learn more about homosexuality and HIV/AIDS through her brother and how she was awed by her brother's spirit in the face of adversity. At times, Ripp's and Morrissey's experiences dovetail with one another. Interview conducted by Robert Sember.</p>

The narrator speaks at length throughout the interview about how her partner’s addiction was harder to deal with than his status as an HIV positive person with AIDS. She speaks of a supportive family, a fulfilling work life and a community of people living with and impacted by HIV and addiction. For this narrator, the AIDS crisis was at first something she ignored, then something that was about people who used drugs and were dying, and eventually about other communities such as gay men and other partners of people living with HIV.

                    <p>Barbara Norris was a nurse working at Woodhull Hospital in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, where she worked at the AIDS clinic. Born in Harlem, New York, she moved to Brooklyn when she was married, had three sons, and two grandchildren. At the time of the interview in 1992, she was a woman of Christian faith whose experience with people living with HIV at the hospital helped shape her view on homosexuals, people who do drugs and other members of the community.</p>

                    <p>In the interview Barbara Norris speaks about her experience as a nurse from the 1970s to the early 1990s in Brooklyn, whose work has been deeply impacted by HIV. She speaks at length about the virus’ impact on the people of Brooklyn, who she saw coming into the hospital. At times she briefly mentions differences within the epidemic in Brooklyn compared to Manhattan. Due to the narrator’s long standing perspective as a nurse with various high positions, she is able to share ideas on the role of the hospital within the epidemic and what ought to be happening. Norris also shares insights into the emotional toll the epidemic has on nurses. Interview conducted by Robert Rosenberg.</p>

                    <p>Sixty-one years old at the time of the interview in 1992, Mildred Pearson was an African-American woman from the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. She was born and raised in Brooklyn's Boerum Hill neighborhood. At Cooper Park public housing, she and her second husband Rutledge raised fourteen children born out of three marriages. Her experience as a mother of a gay son who died of AIDS prompted her to join the Brooklyn AIDS Task Force (BATF), using the story of the loss to communicate information about AIDS. Realizing that more than education was needed to meet the emotional stress experienced by persons with AIDS (PWAs) and their families, Pearson left BATF to establish a support group for mothers of PWAs. Mother's Love had weekly meetings for its members/mothers who engaged in extensive outreach work in Brooklyn and the other boroughs. Mildred Pearson died in April, 1994.</p>

                    <p>In the interview, Mildred Pearson discusses the personal knowledge that came out of being a mother of a person with AIDS (PWA) and working as a care provider. Pearson chronicles the experience of discovering that her son Bruce Williams was sick, the efforts in his treatment, and the home care that had a demonstrative effect on his health. In the wake of Williams' death, she recalls getting help from a volunteer who had befriended Williams. She discusses reaching out to tell her story in support of the Brooklyn AIDS Task Force. In search of a support group for mothers that felt more inclusive and diverse, she tells of forming the Mother's Love group. Pearson describes her development into an activist without a hard-edged militant stance. She touches on many bases that reflected society's responses to the AIDS crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Pearson speaks concretely about health care, social services, and the emotions generated by illness and loss. Pearson also recalls sensing a more tolerant period in her Brooklyn youth. Before ending on a note about the strength she receives from her faith, she takes a view on society's ills of homelessness and addiction and relates those challenges to other human losses that her family has suffered.

They met at a Narcotics Anonymous social shortly after they had begun rehabilitation programs for IV drug users. At the time of their meeting, Post already knew he was HIV positive. Wagner was tested a year or two later and discovered that she too was positive. They had both experienced AIDS related illnesses. Post worked as a cab driver, identified as an activist and attended AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) meetings. Wagner had participated in a variety of AIDS support/activist groups. They were both using Gay Men's Health Crisis resources. Her fifteen year old son was living with the couple in a home in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1992. Before their marriage and AIDS, both Wagner's and Post's lives revolved around drug use.</p>

                    <p>In the interview, Kenny Post and Cheryl Wagner share strong opinions about the particular issues that HIV raises for addicts and are critical of many of the programs established for this population. In addition, Wagner is concerned about AIDS as a woman's issue and presents numerous examples, many of them personal, of the ignorance and discrimination faced by women with AIDS. They both are incisively critical of the healthcare and welfare system in New York City and the inadequate and unequal distribution of resources across the boroughs. Finally, they are people with AIDS who are involved in an intimate and caring relationship and their discussion of this aspect of their lives provides a particular perspective on the emotional impact of the AIDS crisis in the twentieth century.

                    <p>An HIV positive and healthy Puerto Rican gay man, Dr. Luis Nieves Rosa was thirty-three years old in 1992. Raised in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, he moved to San Juan in 1977. Being openly gay since age eighteen, he was convinced later that he had contracted the virus through sex in 1985 or earlier. He moved to Brooklyn in 1988 and lived in the Fort Greene neighborhood when the interview took place. From 1988-1990, he was a caseworker for people with AIDS (PWAs) at Woodhull Hospital in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn. It was during this period that his roommate and good friend got sick and died of AIDS, and Nieves Rosa was a major care-partner for him. Later, he was working at the Hispanic AIDS Forum, and was active with Latino Gay Men of New York on gay and AIDS issues. He had completed a doctoral program in social work at the University of Puerto Rico, where he also teaches, and in 2012 he published on the subject of homophobia in universities. As of 2014, he was serving as Director of the Center for Applied Social Research in Puerto Rico.</p>

                    <p>Luis Nieves Rosa is interviewed about his young adult life as a gay man in Puerto Rico and the four years, prior to this 1992 interview, spent in Brooklyn. He speaks generally about the issues of Latino and gay Latino people with AIDS from his work with the Hispanic AIDS Forum. He weaves together four strands of his story: a gay Latin man who is HIV positive (he participated in an experimental drug study), a care-partner for a friend who died of AIDS, and a service provider and activist on AIDS issues.

                    <p>When interviewed in 1992, Willie Sandoval was a forty-one year old Latino person with AIDS who became infected with the HIV virus through IV drug use. He was one of nine siblings (six sons and three daughters) who witnessed and was subjected to his father's frequent episodes of domestic violence and alcoholism. A resident of Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood as an adult, he was diagnosed in 1988 after being hospitalized for a series of illnesses and psychiatric episodes associated with AIDS. Sandoval then lived at his sister's home in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn, but by 1992, he was often staying in the Lutheran Medical Center's AIDS ward. Sandoval worked with a number of organizations (ACT UP, GMHC, church and education groups) in which he was very active. This community and activist work had to be curtailed because of his health. Brooklyn, as a place to live and as a way of life, was very important to Sandoval. He died on September 26, 1992 of complications due to AIDS. His sister, Rita Rodriguez, was forty-three at the time of the interview, and moved out of Brooklyn in 1993.</p>

                    <p>In the interview, Willie Sandoval speaks of the spread of the epidemic through particular Brooklyn neighborhoods--mainly Sunset Park--with an insider's knowledge. His extensive experience in AIDS organizations make it possible for him to draw comparisons between Brooklyn and other parts of the city; ergo he makes some observations about the differences in attitude between Brooklyn and Manhattan physicians dealing with people with AIDS. Sandoval and Rita Rodriguez recall their difficult upbringing, Sandoval's descent into habitual drug abuse, the trauma he caused to family and how family has responded to his illness. They discuss how treatment can be improved and how awareness can address the stigma associated with the virus. Interview conducted by Robert Sember.</p>

He covers the difference for him in what it means to be living with HIV vs. getting an AIDS diagnosis; the choices he had to make about dis-closure with his friends and family on account of his partner’s comfort level; the lack of good services for people living with HIV in Brooklyn; and the impact that living with HIV has had on his personal relationships, his work, sex life, and engagement with the medical profession. Towards the end of the interview, a different interviewer comes in and prompts the narrator to discuss the first person he knew with HIV in Brooklyn and the differences in stigma and care in Manhattan versus Brooklyn.
