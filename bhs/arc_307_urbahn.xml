    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>A. Urbahn and his family immigrated from Germany to New Jersey beginning in the late 19th century, although they periodically returned to Germany before permanently settling in the United States in 1889. They later moved to Brooklyn, possibly following a conflict with a business partner. The family operated the textile manufacturing business A. Urbahn's Sons, which produced a variety of textiles and garments. The <emph render="italic">Textile World's Directory of the Mill Trade in the United States</emph> lists the business's address as 323 Kosciusko Street in 1897, the company relocated to 158 Marion Street by the 1910s.</p><p>Sources:</p><p><emph render="italic">Textile World's Directory of the Mill Trade in the United States</emph>, 1897</p><p>A.
