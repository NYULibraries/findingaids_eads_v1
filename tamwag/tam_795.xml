    <abstract id="aspace_447ea66caa5834c9ba3906eac2880594">Joseph Isaac Siegel (d. 1972) was a railroad switchman from the 1950s through the early 1970s and an active member of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (BRT), and served as his local union's Legislative Representative for a period of time. The Joseph Siegel Collection on the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (dated 1945-1970) consists of materials created and collected by Siegel documenting his career as a railroad switchman and his engagement with the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen (BRT). Materials in this collection include union membership and certification cards, Siegel's 1966 timebook with notations on strikes, a photograph of Siegel and others at a BRT picnic, a BRT button, and a newspaper clipping of Siegel and others known as the "100% Crew" that may have been published in the union publication Trainman News. The collection also includes a typewritten eulogy delivered at Siegel's funeral, and a letter to Siegel from Lewis Strauss, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, responding to Siegel's inquiry about nuclear weapons testing.</abstract>
