    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>According to documents found in the News Service History file within the General File of the Chief of Correspondents Series, <title render="italic">Time</title> hired David Hulburd in Fall 1929 to report news from Chicago. Stationed in a room next to the advertising office, Hulburd was tasked with monitoring the Midwest for news that was worth national attention. Every day, Hulburd would send back bundles of clippings to <title render="italic">Time</title>'s editorial offices in New York, and, if a reporter found a story they were interested in, the reporter would contact the Research Department to follow up with that newspaper or news service for additional details. The Research Department was headed by Mary Fraiser. News agencies contacted included the United Press Association or the Associated Press. If the Research Department received a reply, Fraser would pay the source. To help <title render="italic">Time</title> gain more sources of news, Hulburd began traveling the country in 1935 to set up other news offices to gather regional stories. The first office was in San Francisco and the next was in Los Angeles. </p><p>Fraser recognized that relying on other news organizations for details and reports was unreliable, and <title render="italic">Time</title> did not always receive replies to its queries. Fraser and Hulburd began setting up <title render="italic">Time</title>'s own domestic and international news bureaus in 1937. In a staff memorandum sent out before his retirement, Hulburd noted that Fraser's encouragement and influence was one of the biggest factors in his decision, as well as the decision of other reporters, to work for <title render="italic">Time</title> and put in the effort to build the bureau of correspondents. </p><p>Hulburd was in charge of managing the bureaus and offices throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. For the first few years, the bureaus remained under the Research Department. With the creation of their own news service, <title render="italic">Time</title> began to hire correspondents and stringers and relied less upon the United Press Association. Time Inc. still contracted with the Associated Press for their other publications. In 1941, the news service was placed under the authority of Henry Luce as <title render="italic">Time</title>'s editor. Around this same time, correspondents for other Time Inc. publications began maintaining news desks in the <title render="italic">Time</title> news bureau offices beginning with Rachel Albertson from <title render="italic">Life</title>.</p><p>From 1937 through most of 1945, Hulburd oversaw both the domestic and foreign correspondents. At this point, the size of the bureaus and number of people employed became too cumbersome for one person, and domestic and foreign affairs were separated. The domestic news service remained part of <title render="italic">Time</title>, but was overseen by the senior editors. During the time that the domestic news service was part of <title render="italic">Time</title>, the department under went a number of name changes. In 1951 it was the Newsbureau, but became the U.S. and Canadian New Service.</p><p>The foreign service was moved to Time-Life International, also known as TLI, and was known as the TLI Foreign Desk. The foreign service remained under TLI until around 1954. At this point, the foreign service appears to have been removed from TLI's jurisdiction and became its own department known as the Overseas Bureaus. By 1960, the department's name was changed to the Foreign News Service. During this period, domestic news bureau chiefs were listed as assistant editors at <title render="italic">Time</title> in the department heads lists, but foreign news bureau chiefs were not. Materials within the collection imply that foreign news bureau chiefs were staff at <title render="italic">Time</title> but they did not seem to receive the same status domestic bureau chiefs.</p><p>The foreign and domestic bureaus continued to operate separately until 1962 when they were once again placed under one news chief who also held a position at <title render="italic">Time</title> as an assistant editor. Richard Clurman, who had been chief of domestic correspondents, became chief of both foreign and domestic correspondents. At first, the new united system was known as the <title render="italic">Time</title> News Service but this name was quickly changed to the Time-Life News Service. Despite only have the names of <title render="italic">Time</title> and <title render="italic">Life</title> in the title, the chief of bureaus appeared to oversee correspondents and stringers for all of Time Inc.'s magazines. One such organization was the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title> which was owned by Time Inc. between 1978 and 1981. During the time that Time Inc. owned the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title>, the newspaper operated as a separate organization but did not have any of their own correspondents or stringers. Rather than hiring their own set of correspondents and stringers, the Time-Life News Service provided personnel to work for the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title>, and the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title> paid the Time-Life News Service for their service. While suppling news for magazines throughout Time Inc., the Time-Life News Service remained part of <title render="italic">Time</title>'s editorial operations until 1985 when the news service became part of the Magazine Group. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Time-Life News Service Records contain materials from Time Inc.'s news gathering branch. While the group was mainly a part of <title render="italic">Time</title> magazine, it employed correspondents, stringers, and staff from a variety of Time Inc. magazines and newspapers. Because of this unusual set up of the news service, <title render="italic">Time</title>'s business office was involved in managing the department's finances until Time-Life News Service began managing its own financial records. Since there was an overlap of financial management, Time-Life New Service's financial office, as well as the chiefs of correspondents, some times collected <title render="italic">Time</title> budgets as well as financial documents for Time Inc. subsidies such as the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title>. The staff represented in these documents include Dick Duncan, Murray Gart, Richard Clurman, John Boyle, Emmet Hughes, Manfred Gottfried, Ben Cate, Suzanne Davis, Linda Vartoogian, and Camille Cassata. The record group includes correspondence, dispatches, staff files, notes, interview and speech transcripts, photoes, clippings, budgets, expense reports, policies, and employee lists.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The Time Inc. Time-Life News Service Records were processed by Samantha Brown in 2019. The original folders were retained although some documents were transferred to archival containers in the instances of overcrowding or if no original folders were present. Brown created the inventory and other descriptive notes for the record. Series were created based on the original arrangement of the materials. Within series, materials were arranged in alphabetical order since the original order was unclear. Files retained their original titles, but files with illegible writing or unclear titles were either assigned new titles or had information added to them to clarify the contents.</p>  </processinfo>

By the early 1960s he was promoted to bureau chief. Between 1969 and 1977, Gart served as the Time-Life News Service's chief of correspondents but left this position in 1978 to become the editor of the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title>. Due to financial issues, the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title> folded in 1981.

Originally found with corporate editorial records, these files were separated and placed with the chief of correspondents' materials when it was discovered that Gart was the creator of these records. The type of materials in this subseries are similar to the materials found the General Files subseries within the Chief of Correspondent Files. Contained in this subseries are budgets, marketing reports, popularity reports, industry reports, executive summaries, lists of staff, dispatches, salary reports, affirmative action reports, meeting attendee lists, conflict of interest policy drafts, meeting agenda, and correspondence. Correspondence in this subseries discusses hiring, circulation, contract negotiations, New York City municipal work strikes, travel schedules, discrimination, traineeship programs, budgets and expenses, conflicts of interests, cost control, staffing changes, and lawsuits.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_d94a1283de8e40c0758ca3ebca8226d3"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged

It is unknown if he held other positions at Time Inc. prior to this. Duncan remained in this position until March 1969 when he was transferred to the Ottawa bureau to serve as their bureau chief. In 1972, Duncan disappeared from the department heads list but reappears in 1974 as the bureau chief of Beverly Hills. Sometime between 1974 and 1978, Duncan becomes deputy chief of correspondents and then chief of correspondents. Duncan remains in this position until May 1986.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>Personnel and Organization: Department Head Lists. Time Inc.

While originally thought to be general chief of correspondent files, these materials were found within their own box and had a single creator. There were no other chief of correspondent files other than the ones created by Duncan. The type of materials in this subseries are similar to the materials found the General Files subseries within the Chief of Correspondent Files. Included in this subseries are lists of meeting attendees, biographical data sheets, dispatches, translations of court documents, dinner event menus, a report on background material for the Korean delegation dinner, CVs, travel itinerary, and correspondence. The correspondence featured in this subseries discusses fellowship programs, meetings, new hires, travel plans, stringers, invitations, consultant reports, proposed projects, schedules, and itinerary.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_668ef39afcff07fcc02d42e9de3e2827"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c

Several sets of General Files were found. It is unclear who grouped files from different chiefs together, if an administrator within the Time-Life News Service or the Time Inc. Arhcies is responsible. The separate sets have been grouped together alphabetically as one series. </p><p>Folder titles include a mix of names, places, and subjects. While the Bureau files subseries and Staff Files series contain folders with titles and materials similar to those found in this subseries, the materials have not been interfiled. The main reason that these materials have remained separate is because they were found stored and arranged separately from one another. </p><p>Contained in this subseries are payroll forms, employment applications, resumes and CVs, clippings, invitations, guests lists, dispatches, translated articles, benefits summary  sheets, annual reports, awards ceremony pamphlets, requisition forms, biographical summaries, press releases, conflict of interest and employment policies, department heads lists, error reports, evaluation guidelines, meeting transcripts, photos, negatives, contact lists, prospectuses, list of Time Inc. board members, news bureau surveys and results, distribution lists, financial statements and reports, seating lists and charts, vacation schedules, query sheets, lists of bureau staff, immigration and visa forms, reports on newstour participants, background research reports for newstours, reports attitudes toward <title render="italic">Time</title>, and memoranda and correspondence. The memoranda and correspondence within this series discusses budgets, travel plans, hiring, salaries, contact information, raises, research, bureau operations and updates, costs, article corrections and comments, staffing changes, stringers, job candidates, job responsibilities, meetings, conflicts of interest, masthead changes and acknowledgments, interview requests, job enquiries, meetings, invitations, censorship, story and project proposals, policies, lawsuits, contracts, shipping of supplies, correspondent assignments, newstour proposals, updates on newstours, schedules, and bureau finances.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_d31df24d38740c5fa35c35dc39abc3ef"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c

After 1974, Time-Life News Service had their own business office, but the department does not show up on department head lists in the Time Inc. Reference Files until 1987. Between 1974 and 1987, those who work on the Time-Life New Service finances are not named on department head lists. </p><p>Notable business department staff include Emily Friedrich, Linda Vartoogian, and Camille Cassata. Emily Friedrich does not appear in any department heads lists. Linda Vartoogian is listed in 1972 and 1974 as an assistant to <title render="italic">Time</title>'s business manager but disappears from the lists after that even though she continues to work on the news service finances until at least 1983. Camille Cassata only appears on the 1987 departments heads list as the news service's financial manager, but the materials themselves indicate she may have been working for the news service as early as 1983.</p><p>Citation:</p><p>Time Inc.

The majority of materials featured in this series were collected by Emily Friedrich, Linda Vartoogian, and Camille Cassata, also called Camille Sanabria after she was married, who appear to have worked in <title render="italic">Time</title>'s Business Office and Time-Life News Service's business office. A variety of chiefs of correspondents appear in the records along with business office staff.

The main chiefs of correspondents who were involved in business department affairs were Richard Clurman, Lawrence Laybourne, James Shepley, Emmet Hughes, Murray Gart, and Dick Duncan. </p><p>Included in this series are budget reports, operating statements, financial statements, lists of salary account, bureau financial reports, Washington Star Payment Reports, contracts, lease agreements, clippings, newsletters, Time mastheads, receipts, notes, copies of checks, invoices, photos, negatives, itinerary, fee requisition forms, and correspondence. The correspondence included in this series discuss expenses, budgets, finances, committee meetings, expenditures, travel, allowances, fees, costs, raises, utility costs, financial payouts, financial issues, salaries, severance pay, visas, refugees eligibility, grocery costs, food stamps, doctor's appointments, money requisitions, contact info, and bureau updates. </p><p>Included in this series are two files on the <title render="italic">Washington Star</title>.

Due to the way that the materials are organized, it is unclear who collected or organized the materials. The files included in this subseries include a mix of staff that were currently working for Time-Life News Service when the files were transferred to the archives as well as files for ex-staff and stringers. If a box appeared to have files mainly for ex-staff or stringers then those boxes were separated and placed into their appropriate subseries. The remaining materials do not offer any indication of their original organization and have been interfiled into one subseries. While there are separate series for ex-staff and stringers, people that fall into those categories may be found in this subseries as well.</p><p>Included in this series are payroll forms, dispatches, photos, negative, visa applications, clippings, job applications, timecards, article drafts, post cards, expense reports, allowance forms, benefit claims forms, receipts, invoices, itinerary, biographical data forms, writing samples, check requisition forms, CVs, resumes, college transcripts, list of job candidates, budget reports, reference letters, query sheets, personnel forms, cost of living reports, department of defense accreditation forms, press releases, vacation schedule forms, disability forms, work and rate records, purchase order forms, inventory forms, insurance forms, entry forms, birth certificates, and correspondence. The correspondence included in this series discusses vacations, retirements, raises, overtime, travel, visas, job offers, story suggestions, taxes, allowances, stringers, salaries, communication issues, expenses, advances, debts, office arrangements, insurance, exchange rates, masthead changes, employment verifications, vacations, housing, resignations, bureau transfers, appliance purchases, immigration, revenue, leaves of absence, and meetings.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_edac337fb091994b41c811e8465df9a7"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Arranged

In 1970, Cate was transferred overseas and placed in charge of the Bonn office. By 1972, he had been transferred back to the main offices in New York where he worked as a deputy chief of correspondents through 1974. By 1978, Cate had left his position as deputy chief and became chief of the Chicago bureau of the Time-Life News Service. He remained in this position until 1981 when he became the chief of the Beverly Hills bureau. In 1985, he was no longer listed as a bureau chief in the departments lists and was instead listed as a senior correspondent. After this point, Cate no longer appears in department heads lists. </p><p>Citations:</p><p>Personnel and Organization: Department Head Lists. Time Inc.

The chappaquiddick materials include dispatches, lists of contacts, clippings, car manuals, investigation notes, investigation policies, court hearing and testimony documents, biographical data sheets, lists of assignments, telephone call logs, car accident forms, rental care agreements and correspondence. These materails appear to have been mainly collected by Time-Life News service staff memember Benjamin Cate and focus on the Chappaquiddick incident involving Ted Kennedy. While the materials were mainly collected by Cate, there are also materials from after he left the news service. It is unclear who collected the materials after Cate since they were found with the Laurence Barrett files but appear to be unrelated to those materials. The second set of materials are dispatches with details about Howard Hughes, Jackie Kennedy, Scientology, and United Presidents as well as their wives and cabinent members. While the majority of dispatches were transferred and filed with the editorial reference files when the Time Research Center was created, these were materials were missed and found loose with unrelated corporate editorial files. While these materials may have been found with unrelated materials, they were originally produced and collected by the news service and will be stored with their materials.
