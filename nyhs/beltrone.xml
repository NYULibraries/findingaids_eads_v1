            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The correspondence in the Vincenzo Beltrone Collection spans 1924–1968, but at its core are the letters exchanged between Beltrone and his fiancée (later wife), Kate Felicita Fabian (1903–1969), during his internment as an alien enemy of the United States, 1941–1945. Beltrone and Fabian each wrote often—sometimes more than once per day—to and from the locations of his internment, which changed with dizzying frequency (see the 
                <emph render="bold">Biographical/Historical Note</emph> for places and dates). The letters describe conditions in the camps, Beltrone's health, and endless efforts to clear his name. A number of the letters have been razored or redacted by government censors.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>Some correspondence is with Edward J. Ennis (1908–1990), director of the alien enemy control unit of the Department of Justice, and Howard F. Corcoran (1906–1989), U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>A few letters are from Beltrone’s fellow detainees on Ellis Island, congratulating him on his release. One, from a woman named Gloria McCleod (postmarked 19 June 1945), describes her attempted suicide: “I am sincerly sorry I had to let you see such an unpleasant sight as it must of been to see me jump from the balcony.” Another frequent correspondent in the collection is Raven Poetry Circle founder Francis Lambert McCrudden.
                <emph render="bold">(See Series I)</emph>
                <lb/></p>
            <p>While researching her article “Alien Enemy M68-279: The Unresolved Case of Vincenzo Beltrone,” published in the May/June 1987 issue of 
                <emph render="bolditalic">Attenzione</emph>, Roslyn Bernstein (donor of this collection) requested and received by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) a copy of Beltrone’s WWII Alien Enemy Detention and Internment Case File from the U.S. Department of Justice. It contains correspondence, questionnaires, affidavits, and other documents dating between 1940 and 1947 that tell the complete story of Beltrone's arrest, internment, and eventual release. 
                <emph render="bold">(See Series II)</emph>
                <lb/></p>
            <p>The collection includes typescript and manuscript versions of virtually all Beltrone’s poetry and some of his prose, in Italian and English. He was an active member of the Raven Poetry Circle of Greenwich Village, and some sheets show evidence of having been thumbtacked for display and sale at Raven shows on Washington Square. After her husband’s death, Kate Fabian Beltrone worked to assemble an omnibus edition of his writing called 
                <emph render="bolditalic">Poetic Letters</emph>. This never materialized, apparently, but the projected book was to include 293 poems, some drawn from his only known published volume, 
                <emph render="bolditalic">Eroica and Other Poems</emph> (New York: S. F. Vanni, 1940). The drafts for a number of these sections survive in the collection, but it is unclear at what stage Kate left the project on her death in 1969. There are also photocopies of pages from journals Beltrone kept while serving as a private in the signal corps of the Italian army in Somaliland, 1935–1936, and copies of some of the pro-Fascist editorials he wrote for the newspaper 
                <emph render="bolditalic">Il Grido della Stirpe</emph> [The Cry of the Race]. 
                <emph render="bold">(See Series III)</emph>
                <lb/></p>
            <p>A mix of published material—mostly poetry books (some in Italian) and poetry journals—that belonged to Vincenzo Beltrone and his widow, rounds out the collection. Kate Fabian Beltrone, a poet herself, was a contributing editor to 
                <emph render="bolditalic">PEGASUS: The Poetry Quarterly</emph>, in which she published her late husband’s verse along with her own. A few scattered issues are in box 7, folder 2. The collection also includes two small woodblock printing plate portraits of Beltrone, one of which is reproduced in the 1987 version of Roslyn Bernstein’s article, “Alien Enemy M68-279: The Unresolved Case of Vincenzo Beltrone.”

            <p>Throughout his work and correspondence the artist and poet Vincenzo Nicola Ostilio Beltrone (1895–1950) signed his name multiple ways: Vincenzo N. O. Beltrone, Vincenzo di Beltrone, Vincent Beltrone, and even “N. O. Belzo.” This finding aid refers to him by the name he used most frequently—
                <emph render="bold">Vincenzo Beltrone</emph>—or, simply, Beltrone, but all the variants above (and possibly others) appear on documents throughout the collection.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>Similarly, Beltrone’s second wife and widow was known variously as Kate Felicita Fabian, Kate (or Kay) Fabian, Kate Beltrone, and 
                <emph render="bold">Kate Fabian Beltrone</emph>. This finding aid uses the latter.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>Vincenzo Beltrone was born on 7 August 1895 at Stignano, Calabria, Italy, to Giuseppe and Ildebranda (Cortesi) Beltrone. When he was twelve years old he emigrated to America, arriving at the Port of New York aboard the 
                <emph render="italic">S.S. Sannio</emph> on 26 September 1907. He attended P.S. 7, on Chrystie Street, Manhattan, and later claimed to have graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1914.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>On 5 June 1917 Beltrone registered for the World War I draft, listing his occupation as artist. He entered the U.S. Army on 25 October 1918, serving briefly in the Coast Artillery at Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn. He was honorably discharged for a physical disability on 15 November.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>In December 1923 he made the first of two trips back to Italy to see family (his parents and siblings did not remain permanently in America). A certified copy of his birth certificate in the collection (
                <ref target="ref31">see box 4, folder 4</ref>) dates from this visit. He returned to New York aboard the 
                <emph render="italic">S.S. Duilio</emph> on 21 October 1924.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>At some point Beltrone began writing poetry, but an explosion and fire at his studio (then at 31 West 16th Street) destroyed all the work he had composed by 1 August 1927. He rebounded quickly, though, since he had verse to read at “Poets’ Soiree” in Greenwich Village on the 25th. Also that year, Beltrone was supposedly named “Poet of the New York City School System.” He became closely associated with Francis Lambert McCrudden (1872–1958), founder of the Raven Poetry Circle of Greenwich Village, whose members displayed and sold their works along a fence on Washington Square, charging prices like fifteen cents a poem. The Ravens adopted as their motto Beltrone’s line: “Ink is the silent partner of remembrance.”
                <lb/></p>
            <p>On 6 May 1930 Beltrone married Mary Venezia D’Amato, whom he would divorce on 24 June 1935. In November of that year, he returned for the second time to Italy. Ostensibly he made the trip to settle his late father’s estate, but once there was conscripted to serve—or possibly volunteered—in Mussolini’s army during the Italo-Ethopian War. (His politics were widely known: on 18 June 1934 the 
                <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> labeled him an “artist, poet and Fascist editor.”) Beltrone was stationed in Somaliland between December 1935 and September 1936. A small broadside from this time—“Ai Legionari dei Fasci Italiani all’Estero” (“To the Legions of Italian Fascists Abroad”)—sends the praises of Rome to the victorious forces in Ogaden and Dire Dawa, Ethiopia (
                <ref target="ref31">see box 4, folder 4</ref>).
                <lb/></p>
            <p>Once back in New York—he returned on 1 April 1937 aboard the 
                <emph render="italic">S.S. Conte di Savoia</emph>—Beltrone worked as an information-desk guard for the Italian Pavilion of the 1939 New York World’s Fair. He began the process of naturalization, but his Italian military service and later editorials for the pro-fascist newspaper, 
                <emph render="italic">Il Grido della Stirpe</emph> (“The Cry of the Race”; 
                <ref target="ref62">see box 5, folder 2 for examples</ref>), ended his chances of becoming an American citizen.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>On 8 December 1941, Edward J. Ennis, chief counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, convinced President Roosevelt to extend to Italians the regulations then in place against Japanese aliens, who were being arrested as possible enemies of state. Beltrone was among the first Italians the FBI apprehended that very day “because of the belief that his continued freedom of movement was dangerous to the United States.” (Domenico Trombetta, publisher of 
                <emph render="italic">Il Grido della Stirpe</emph>, was also arrested and indicted as a foreign agent.)
                <lb/></p>
            <p>Beltrone was interned for nearly the duration of World War II, at multiple locations. The dates he stayed at each facility (below) are drawn from his correspondence (

                <lb/></p>
            <p>Beltrone died on 26 January 1950, aged fifty-four. Until 
                <emph render="italic">her</emph> death fourteen years later, Kate worked toward compiling an omnibus edition of her husband’s work, drawn from his sole known published volume,

                    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                    <p>Series I consists largely of the correspondence exchanged between Beltrone and his fiancée (later wife), Kate Felicita Fabian (1903–1969), during his internment as an alien enemy of the United States, 1941–1945. Beltrone and Fabian each wrote often—sometimes more than once per day—to and from the locations of his internment. Their letters describe conditions in the camps, Beltrone’s health, and attempts to clear his name. A number of the letters have been razored or redacted by government censors.
                        <lb/></p>
                    <p>Some correspondence is with Edward J. Ennis (1908–1990), director of the alien enemy control unit of the Department of Justice, and Howard F. Corcoran (1906–1989), U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.
                        <lb/></p>
                    <p>A few letters are from Beltrone’s fellow detainees on Ellis Island, congratulating him on his release. One, from a woman named Gloria McCleod (postmarked 19 June 1945), describes her attempted suicide: “I am sincerly sorry I had to let you see such an unpleasant sight as it must of been to see me jump from the balcony.” Another frequent correspondent in the series is Raven Poetry Circle founder Francis Lambert McCrudden, whose letters are noted in the container list below.</p>

                        <p>Typescript poems from a binder marked “Typed Copy 1945 / 1939-41,” some with handwritten annotations and drawings. The thumbtack holes in at least two sheets—the poems “Hotel Lobby” and “Skyscraper”—as well as the handwritten price (15-cents) indicate they were likely displayed and offered for sale at Raven Poetry Circle gatherings on Washington Square.</p>

                    <p>Series IV contains a mix of published material—mostly poetry books (some in Italian) and poetry journals—that belonged to Vincenzo Beltrone and his widow, the poet Kate Fabian Beltrone. Vincenzo died early in 1950, so anything dating from before then could conceivably have been his.

                        <emph render="bolditalic">PEGASUS: The Poetry Quarterly</emph>, in which she published her late husband’s verse along with her own. A few scattered issues are in box 7, folder 2.
                        <lb/></p>
                    <p>Series IV also includes two small woodblock printing plate portraits of Beltrone, one of which is reproduced in the 1987 version of Roslyn Bernstein’s article, “Alien Enemy M68-279: The Unresolved Case of Vincenzo Beltrone” (box 4, folder 8).</p>
