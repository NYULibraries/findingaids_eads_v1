            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">The New-York Historical Society general correspondence record group contains chronologically arranged communications directed to and from the institution and its officers. The bulk of correspondence through the early twentieth century is incoming only, though some notes, responses, and letterpress copybooks (1876-1911) of outgoing correspondence appear. Carbon copies of outgoing correspondence commonly appear after the early twentieth century. The files are predominated by requests for reference assistance; research reports; inquiries pertaining to membership and library operations; proposals of materials for donation, sale, or transfer; arrangements for lectures, events, and publications; acceptances of election to member or officer positions; financial transactions; requests for material exchanges; and invitations, circulars, and other printed matter generated by N-YHS and outside institutions. Correspondents include N-YHS officers, prominent historians, politicians, writers and lecturers, scientists, genealogists, artists, printers and booksellers, and colleagues from libraries, societies, government agencies, and other organizations.</abstract>

            <p>The record group was physically processed, likely about 1990. In 2015, archivist Brynn White and, in 2016, archivist Margaret Kaczorowski refined the arrangement, integrated additional material, and described the documents in this finding aid. A few additional letters were added in 2017 by archivist Larry Weimer.</p>

            <p>This finding aid relates to just one record group of the New-York Historical Society archives. Although this record group includes the bulk of correspondence incoming to N-YHS throughout its history until 1982, significant correspondence on specific topics to that time can be found in several other N-YHS record groups. Post-1982 correspondence is also found in other record groups. For information about the other record groups and for overall information about the archives, please see the overview

            <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
            <p>The New-York Historical Society general correspondence record group contains the chronologically arranged central files of communications directed to and from the institution and its officers. These files range over almost all of N-YHS’s first two hundred years of existence, from its first full year of operations in 1805 to the end of Director James Heslin’s administration in 1982, though files from 1960 forward are currently restricted. In addition, the record group includes a series of selected letters from notable correspondents that ranges to 2017.</p>
            <p>For the nineteenth century, the bulk of correspondence is incoming, but some notes, responses, and letterpress copybooks (1876-1911), of outgoing mail appear. Most communication is written or directed to the Librarian, as well as other officers. The copybooks and yearly registers of correspondents, beginning in 1876 when N-YHS appears to have formalized a system for retention of correspondence, may serve as a guide to researchers in locating materials related to specific individuals and organizations and these continue through 1908. By the early twentieth century, carbon copies of outgoing correspondence appear regularly and continues through 1982.</p>
            <p>The record group is predominated by requests for reference assistance; research reports; inquiries pertaining to membership and library operations; proposals of materials for donation, sale, or transfer; arrangements for lectures, events, and publications; acceptances of election to member or officer positions; requests for exchanges of material, such as annual reports or other publications; and invitations, circulars, and other printed matter generated by N-YHS and outside institutions.</p>
            <p>Internally produced correspondence includes memoranda such as meeting minutes excerpts, official acceptances and resignations, drafts and notes for deceased member memorials, presentation and resolution drafts, and informal reports on relevant legislation, commissions, funding, finances and investments, acquisitions and donations, buildings maintenance and facilities, and other aspects and issues of operations.</p>
            <p>Correspondents include N-YHS officers, prominent historians, politicians, writers and lecturers, scientists, genealogists, artists, printers and booksellers, publishers, donors, antiquarians, and colleagues from libraries, museums, societies, government agencies, and other organizations. International repositories and individuals, many of whom are honorary N-YHS members, correspond from distant locations including China, France, Portugal, Brazil, and Denmark.</p>

                    <p>The Notable Correspondents series consists of letters removed from the General Correspondence files (see Series III) by prior N-YHS staff based on their perceived value and importance. Correspondents include former American presidents and significant scholars, authors, politicans, journalists, historians, and other figures.</p>
                    <p>A bulk of the letters are acknowledgments of election as an Honorary Member or responses to invitations to deliver a lecture or attend an N-YHS event. The content for every letter in this series is noted in the container list, with the exception of three files arranged and described based on common event or correspondent.</p>
                    <p>Highlights of the series include correspondence documenting the N-YHS acquisition of John Jay Audubon's original 
                        <emph render="italic">Birds of America</emph> watercolor portfolios from his widow Lucy and a letter from Thomas Jefferson Randolph discussing the condition of Thomas Jefferson during the year leading up to his death. Substantive manuscripts include an account by John R. Bartlett of his mid-19th-century travels through Mexico, the American Southwest, and California; report by Amos Kendall on the death of Tecumseh; extrapolation by Orasmus Holmes Marshall of research into the site of La Salle's 1679 shipyard; and contestations by George Gibbs of recent claims on the island discoveries of Christopher Columbus.</p>

                        <p>Incoming and outgoing correspondence with N-YHS Librarian Alexander J. Wall, chiefly tracing the N-YHS reprinting and distribution of a volume of Minutes of the New York Council of Appointments (4/2/1777-3/4/1779) owned by FDR. Also includes research inquiries into seventeeth-century land grant Great Nine Partners Patent and other Dutchess County history; FDR's campaign to create a naval and marine museum in conjunction with N-YHS; and 1931 requests for support of FDR while he is serving as governor. Two letters addressed to N-YHS President John A. Weekes, a cousin of Roosevelt, decline his invitation to serve on the Executive Committee, due to health, and accept election as Honorary Member. Three letters from Roosevelt in regard to FDR sitting for a portrait prior to, and following, his election and inauguration as Governor to be painted by DeWitt M. Lockman for the Society. Portraits were to be exhibited at the Society once completed (see also Box 157 F 7). 34 items [17 originals from Roosevelt]</p>

                    <p>The Letterpress Copybooks series is comprised of five bound volumes containing copies of the New-York Historical Society’s outgoing mail between the years of 1876 and 1913, chiefly written by the Librarian as well as other N-YHS officers; two additional volumes contain the correspondence of 
                        <emph render="italic">Magazine of American History</emph> editor and founder John Austin Stevens for the full year of 1878 and November-December of 1879. The letters are recorded in chronological order, with individual pages containing one to two letters. Registers in the front of the letter books offer accurate lists of recipients recorded alphabetically by last name, alongside the page numbers of relevant correspondence.</p>
                    <p>The general materials appear relatively comprehensive for the 1870s and 1880s, which also frequently feature formal correspondence directed between N-YHS officers, and the 1900s; copies of outgoing mail were less consistently maintained in other years. Series content commonly mirrors the General Correspondence files of Series III, consisting of answers to research, library operations, and membership inquiries; responses to acquisitions proposals and suggestions; acknowledgments of receipt of materials; arrangements for events and publications; and notifications of elections, appointments, resolutions, meetings, lectures, and other N-YHS committee activity. The Stevens copybooks concern various facets of magazine production such as contributor solicitation, research, and more.</p>
                    <p>Notes for each volume identify frequent and/or notable correspondents, as applicable, and break down the page ranges by year for general correspondence copybooks, to provide researchers with a sense of scope for time periods of interest. The letter book registers may serve as a potential guide to the General Correspondence files for researchers interested in specific correspondents, as they may suggest time frames in which people were in communication with N-YHS.</p>

                    <p>The General Correspondence, 1805-1908 series contains chronological files of communications directed to and from New-York Historical Society and its officers, ranging from its founding through the Fall 1908 relocation into its current building on Central Park West.</p>
                    <p>The bulk of correspondence is incoming, but some notes, responses, and copies of letters produced by New-York Historical Society appear (see also: Series II. Letterpress copybooks of outgoing correspondence, 1876-1911). Librarian William Kelby (1893-1898) frequently annotated letters in red pen, while his successor Robert Kelby (1898-1921) often wrote short notes or instructions on N-YHS responses to letters received. Internally produced correspondence includes memoranda such as excerpts of meeting minutes, acceptances of election to an N-YHS office and resignations, drafts and notes for deceased member memorials, presentation and resolution drafts, and informal reports on relevant legislation, commissions, funding, acquisitions, and other aspects and issues of operations. The recurring presence of N-YHS presidential and intra-officer correspondence commences with the tenure of Luther Bradish (1850-1863), and continues more predominantly with Frederic De Peyster (1864-1866; 1873-1882) and John A. King (1877-1900). Until president Samuel Verplanck Hoffman (1903-1912), the officials’ correspondence tone and content remains relatively formal, chiefly concerned with facilities, fundraising, and meeting and committee logistics.</p>
                    <p>Five incomplete registers of correspondence dating between 1805 and 1847 open the series, chronologically listing select letters by date and corresponding parties. Beginning in 1876, N-YHS officers regularly maintained registers recording the senders of letters received, which may be used as guides to the files. The registers appear fairly accurate, but should not be regarded as comprehensive. Notes on the most frequent and/or notable correspondents -- excluding N-YHS officers at the time, whom are implied -- appear accompanying each register in the container list.</p>
                    <p>The files are predominated by letters of acknowledgment or decline for N-YHS membership, committee, and officer election; reference inquiries and research requests; and proposals of materials for donation, sale, or transfer to the institution. The latter may be accompanied by sketches, inventories, and further description; these trace the trends, conditions, costs, and context of N-YHS collection development during this period. A small amount of the submitted materials themselves are present and noted.</p>
                    <p>Correspondence from the first twenty five years of the institution is minimal but by 1840 grows more comprehensive, prolific, and varied, with an increase in lecture proposals and arrangements, publications planning, research reports and funding requests, submissions for presentation before the Society, and general discussion of the services, operations, and activities of the institution. Library staff began to receive a growing number of reference inquiries (commonly relating to family genealogy and military, specifically Revolutionary War, history), space rental requests, and letters of introduction for researchers and potential members. The files also contain event and ticket requests (including election to special committees or delegations), personal information updates such as changes of address and deaths, dues payments and related membership inquiries, news clippings, bills for service, and corrections and commentary on N-YHS published material. These trends continue throughout the series. A select amount of personal correspondence with N-YHS officers appears, with Librarians George H. Moore (1849-1876), a scholar of the history of slavery in New England, and Robert Kelby often addressed on a more intimate and collegial basis.</p>
                    <p>The early to mid-19th-century correspondence files depict the institution as a sounding board for amateur and professional historians and genealogists, who share their investigations with N-YHS both formally and informally, solicited and unsolicited. Many other core correspondents are peers affiliated with related institutions, such as libraries and other historical societies, who often seek advice and material exchanges. The files represent a cross-section of prominent N-YHS members and officers (DeWitt Clinton, Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, Egbert Benson, Gouverneur Morris, Frederic De Peyster, James Beekman, and Hamilton Fish); historians (John Farmer, Jared Sparks, John Russell Bartlett, Edmund Bailey O’Callaghan, George Bancroft, John Law, Frederick Kapp, Samuel Osgood); writers and lecturers (Lindley Murray, Horatio Gates Spaffords, Prosper Montgomery Wetmore, John Watts De Peyster, Pliny Miles); theologians (Samuel Miller, William Bentley); scientists (Henry R. Schoolcraft); genealogists (Robert Dodge, Henry Cruger Van Schaack); printers and booksellers (Isaac Collins, John W. Taylor, Joel Munsell, John H. Hickcox); publishers (George Palmer Putnam, William Henry Appleton); and antiquarians (Samuel Gardner Drake). International repositories and individuals, many of whom are honorary N-YHS members, correspond from distant locations including China, France, Portugal, Brazil, and Denmark.</p>
                    <p>By 1840, N-YHS began efforts to systematize its acquisition of materials, reaching out to state and federal government agencies and other repositories to seek publications and documentation. Around this time printed matter begins to appear and is thereafter interspersed throughout the files. These materials include membership certificates and dues receipts, meeting invitations, deeds of gift, formal acknowledgments of receipt and shipment notices from other repositories, and distribution materials or “circulars” produced by both New-York Historical Society and other institutions, such as the Smithsonian Institute, Maryland Historical Society, Mercantile Library, American Antiquarian Society, and American Philosophy Society. The Society's collecting habits also expand around mid-century to more substantially incorporate painting, sculpture, and other artworks, with the Correspondence files including documentation of these acquisitions and commissions. The Abbott Collection of Egyptian antiquities, acquired by N-YHS in 1860, also incites great interest and inquiry.</p>
                    <p>Over the next several decades, the field of librarianship further professionalizes and libraries, historical societies, government agencies, and other organizations, continue to proliferate and representatives regularly contact N-YHS for exchanges and other professional discourse, data collection, consultation, and collaboration. Colleagues in regular communication include A.R. Spofford, M.M. Bagg, F.D. Stone, Harriet Tenney, Lyman C. Draper, Charles Sprague Smith, Emma Toedteberg, Worthington C. Ford, John Shaw Billings, Isaac F. Wood, Melville Dewey, George C. McWhorter, Brantz Mayer, and other representatives from institutions including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Columbia University, Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institute, Long Island Historical Society, New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, American Bible Society, American Museum of Natural History, Historical Society of Pennsylvania, United States Department of the Interior, New York State Historical Association, Wisconsin Historical Society, New York City History Club, Maryland Historical Society, the Lenox and Astor Libraries, and their successor, the New York Public Library. Founder of the Sons of the Revolution and former N-YHS librarian (1876-1878) John Austin Stevens is a regular correspondent during the tenures of George H. Moore and Robert Kelby.</p>
                    <p>Printed matter and circulars further increase as well, including press kits for travelling lecturers, auctions, and publications and business cards, postcards, and other advertisements, of which many highlight new developments in conservation, photography, and other technology. Solicitations for services, employment, research and organization funding, and real estate sales increase, particularly in the late 1880s as public awareness rises of the organization’s attempts to raise money for a new building, and its subsequent purchase of land uptown. Further materials relate to the N-YHS Publication Fund, including inquiries on purchase, transfer, order, withdrawal, and other shareholder matters. These materials begin appearing around 1885.</p>
                    <p>By the 1890s, the files reflect the growing anxiety over N-YHS leadership and facilities, exclusionary policies, and conflicts over public access to the collections. The early 20th-century finds N-YHS staff preparing for the institution’s centennial celebration while continually refusing acquisition offers in the face of funding demands for the continually stalled building construction and relocation; some Building Fund, Building Committee, and other fundraising related correspondence appears, including that of substantial donors the De Peyster family, Henry Dexter, and Mary Rhinelander King.</p>
                    <p>Prominent historians of the time regularly feature in the files dating from the mid-19th-century through the end of the series: Orasmus Holmes Marshall, Benson John Lossing , Martha J. Lamb, Evert Augustus Duyckinck, Anna Matilda Woodhull, Joseph W. Moulton, James Riker, George Washington Greene, Edmund Bailey O’Callaghan, J. Franklin Jameson, Reginald Pelham Bolton, Jane Meade Welch, Woodbury Lowery, Mary Stoughton Locke, and Mary V. Worstell. Other frequent and notable correspondents from this time period include writers and lecturers (William Cullen Bryant, Henry Steel Olcott, Henry B. Dawson, and Gherardi Davis ); politicians (William H. Seward, John V.L. Pruyn, Smith E. Lane, Asa Bird Gardiner, John Winthrop Chanler, John Bigelow, John Harper Trumbull, and Frederick C. Cook); educators (James C. Welling and John Howard Van Amringe); theologians (Charles Washington Baird, William Reed Huntington, and Horatio Gates Jones); artists (John G. Chapman, George Catlin, Louis Lang, and H.A. McArdle); architects (Edward Lippincott Tilton); scientists (Henry William Ravenel, John William Draper, and Samuel W. Francis); genealogists (Joseph Jackson Howard and Morris P. Ferris); printers and booksellers (Charles Burr Todd, Robert Clarke, John F. Trow, Walter Aldrich, and U.P. James); publishers (G.P. Putnam, A.W. Elson); art dealers (Samuel Putnam Avery); antiquarians (James Carson Brevoort); and contractors of N-YHS (photographers Edward Bierstadt and George C. Dodd, art conservator H.A. Hammond Smith, and fundraiser Frank G. Tilford).</p>
                    <p>The series also documents the many lectures , special meetings, and memorial events hosted by N-YHS, containing print invitations, announcements, RSVPs, delegate and special committee election responses, and arrangements with special guests and speakers (including proposals and direct invitation responses, updates on research and presentation topics, accompaniments such as lantern slides, and subsequent publication of lectures). The files contain considerable amounts of ephemera relating to other institutions and events: tickets and invitations for important events such as the opening of Niagara Falls state reservation and the dedication of the Statue of Liberty, and circulars for Worlds Fairs and other expositions, often accompanying letters of recruitment for N-YHS participation. Late-19th century materials in particular portray N-YHS, its members and its brethren’s advocacy, fundraising, and other participation in movements to commemorate important historical events, figures, and locales through monuments and celebrations. Also included is a series of documentation relating to N-YHS’s advocacy and petition to the state legislature to take firmer action in the preservation of public records, for which a Record Preservation Committee was formed.</p>

                    <p>Although this series includes the bulk of correspondence incoming to N-YHS for the period 1804-1908, significant correspondence on specific topics can be found in other N-YHS record groups. For example, New-York Historical Society original buildings planning &amp; construction records (NYHS-RG 3) includes extensive correspondence concerning the construction of N-YHS’s homes at 2nd Avenue and 11th Street and at Central Park West, as well as the institution’s pursuit of space in Central Park in the mid nineteenth century. New-York Historical Society celebratory and memorial event records (NYHS-RG 12) includes correspondence related to anniversaries and some other special events in N-YHS’s history.</p>

                    <head>Arrangement and Description Note</head>
                    <p>The series is arranged chronologically.</p>
                    <p>Documents and correspondents identified by the processing archivist as being of substance and/or significance to N-YHS institutional history or historical thought are identified in folder-level notes. However, these were identified within the time constraints of processing and so cannot be relied on exclusively by researchers.</p>
                    <p>Some attempt was made to group and note letters related to a similar subject matter or correspondent. All bequests and estate activity are noted after 1890.</p>
                    <p>The majority of pre-1860 correspondence is directly preceded by a typescript of letter contents. Typescripts were generated by former N-YHS personnel, in varying degrees of comprehensiveness and accuracy. Copies or transcripts of select documents from Series I. Notable Correspondents materials appear in the files. Early folders may contain small pieces of scrap paper identifying acquisitions indicated by the correspondence content.</p>
                    <p>Although N-YHS officers began binding incoming correspondence around 1876, it was subsequently disbound at some point by a conservator. Due to damage inflicted by binding adhesive, most materials between 1885 and 1898 are interleaved with bond paper. In other folders, fragile materials have been placed in the back, either interleaved or in an appropriately marked protective sling. Small items such as postcards, tickets, and business cards, are housed in envelopes within their appropriate folders.</p>
                    <p>Prior N-YHS staff further arranged select correspondence between 1860 and 1875 into Executive Committee, Library Administration and Acquisitions, and Museum categories:</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="bold">Executive Committee</emph> files include nomination acceptances and acknowledgments, membership and position inquiries and resignations, dues payments, meeting notices and RSVPs, and other documentation of committee activity.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="bold">Library Administration/Acquisition &amp; Donation </emph>files include catalog and exchange requests; inquiries and advertisements from booksellers, agents, publishers, binders, and printers; requests to visit the library or copy materials; and reference requests, acquisition proposals, and other correspondence relating to books, periodicals, photographs, government documents, pamphlets, and other manuscript materials.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="bold">Museum</emph> files include requests to copy N-YHS artworks, reference inquiries, acquisition proposals, and other correspondence relating to paintings, sculptures, coins, instruments, antiquities, textiles and other artifacts and relics.</p>
                    <p>This subject arrangement has been maintained, though files have been relocated to the end of file runs in their respective years. Researchers should not assume that individual materials have been diligently arranged according to this thematic scheme, and are advised to additionally consult the general files for time periods of interest.</p>
                    <p>It is recommended that researchers interested in ephemera, or seeking circulars or other missing attachments for letters, consult the Undated folders at the end of every year, where much of these materials appear to have been placed.</p>
                    <p>Undated material estimates were made by prior N-YHS staff who performed the original chronological arrangement, presumably based off the original order in which they were found.</p>

                    <p>This series was processed perhaps circa 2000, with documents transferred from original folders to archival containers. In 2015, archivist Brynn White refined the arrangement, integrated additional documents found, and provided description in a finding aid for the series.</p>

                        <p>Includes correspondence between N-YHS Librarian Robert Kelby and long-time member and famed historian John Austin Stevens; letters are mostly of a personal nature and relate to collection development and Stevens's scholarly research. The bulk documents his efforts to commemorate the development of the New York City street grid, including appeals to the city and N-YHS to organize centennial celebrations, the latter at which he ultimately gives a lecture on the topic. Select responses from President Hoffman and other interested parties are also present in the file. (Earlier Stevens letters may be found throughout the Correspondence record group.)</p>

                    <p>N-YHS generally restricts the records of the Board and the Executive Office for fifty years following the conclusion of the tenure of a President and CEO (formerly, Director). Correspondence from 1960-1982 is currently restricted as these files were held in the Director's Office.</p>

                    <p>The General Correspondence (1908-1982) series begins with the summer of 1908, when the N-YHS has officially reopened in its new (and current) building on Central Park West. The majority of correspondence between 1908 and 1926 continues to be offers for donation or purchase; historical and genealogical reference inquiries from across the country and world (many of which it cannot accommodate owing to limited staff); documentation of N-YHS involvement in local events and advocacy for memorials and preservation; arrangements and receipts for various lecturers, services and goods, and materials exchanged with other institutions; and letters concerning membership (dues, member election and acceptance, Publication Fund shares). Toward the end of the 1910s, the Library took on more freelance consultants and cataloging staff.</p>
                    <p>During this time, N-YHS continued to field complaints about its governance and operations (culminating with the Van Rensselaer attacks in 1917), while also extending counsel to emerging societies and other historical institutions. Funding problems abounded, with a prevailing sentiment that upper class New Yorkers, despite widespread interest in local and national history, were not willing to contribute to the sustainability of N-YHS. Some women, youth, and school groups voice a sense of exclusion, while others decry it as an old-fashioned boys club that could be more civic-minded. N-YHS shifted its scope to more strictly address New York state and some larger United States history and focuses its art collecting on portraits of local importance. Photostatting was a prominent technological development, and N-YHS collaborated with a variety of organizations to assemble and share reproductions of old newspapers and other materials. Controversially, the Society continued to pour money into the preservation and cataloging of its Egyptian antiquities (primarily, the Abbott Collection), bringing Caroline Ransom Williams on to the staff for that purpose. A new initiative begun in 1917 was the creation of a Field Exploration Committee; headed by William Calver and Reginald Bolton, the Committee conducted amateur excavations at various New York sites, finding Indian, colonial, and Revolutionary War era artifacts. This series includes extensive correspondence regarding this important period in N-YHS’s history and the new directions it took through the 1920s.</p>
                    <p>Beginning in the latter 1920s, there was an increased interest of organizations to preserve and celebrate places of historical consequence. The N-YHS served at the forefront of this preservation movement, and N-YHS’s efforts and activism would continue throughout the 20th century. N-YHS provided documentation and illustrations from its collection to Colonial Williamsburg’s restoration project, including to T.R. Goodwin (Director, Department of Education). Notably, N-YHS was involved in the preservation efforts of Castle Clinton (see also Series V), Fort Ticonderoga, the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument, and the Schenck Homestead (Brooklyn). Notable correspondents include Robert Moses, Stephen H. Pell, Robert F. Wagner, and the New York Historical Association. The bulk of correspondence of incoming and outgoing responses from Librarian Alexander J. Wall (who was appointed Director in 1937) continued to be exchanged with patrons, historians, genealogists, vendors (book and art dealers), and outside institutions (e.g., American Antiquarian Society, Chicago Historical Society, Colonial Williamsburg, Library of Congress, Massachusetts Historical Society, Metropolitan Museum of Art, American Museum of Natural History, New York State Historical Association, Smithsonian Institution, Sons of the American Revolution). These matters included reference inquiries (particularly genealogical, Revolutionary War related, or concerning New York City or State); invitations to commemorations; personal information including change of address and death announcements; and continued exchanges with other museums and historical societies. Lecture proposals were arranged between N-YHS and lecturers Poultney Bigelow, Harry T. Peters and many others. N-YHS continued to be involved with historical events and commemorations across New York State and the country by loaning materials or advising (e.g. George Washington Birthday Bicentennial, the American Revolution Sesquicentennial, United States Constitution Sesquicentennial, 1939 New York World’s Fair).</p>
                    <p>By 1937, as a result of several large bequests to N-YHS (in particular the Elizabeth Gardiner Thompson estate), the institution was able to proceed with a major building expansion and renovation, during which time the building was closed for over a year. Many materials were moved offsite during reconstruction, including the Egyptian collection which was loaned and ultimately sold to the Brooklyn Museum. N-YHS was therefore able to make more storage room for collections related to New York history, such as a separate room for the Bella Landauer Collection. Other additions to the museum included new lighting following a trip abroad by Director A.J. Wall and George Zabriskie (Treasurer) to study proper lighting of European museums. Continuing up through the 1940s, storage continued to be problem for the museum’s growing collections; letters exchanged concern Philip N. Youtz being commissioned as Architect for unrealized plans for a further expansion of the building to encompass an Education Building. The N-YHS’s quest to be recognized as an educational museum had finally been realized in 1928 when the museum was declared a tax-exempt educational institution. This recognition opened the door for generous donations, and allowed the institution to take a more involved role in reaching out to schools and students in the city. In the following decades, N-YHS played a large role in furthering the education of students by offering programs, classes, film series, and the distribution of half tone reproductions of portraits, early views, and objects owned by the Society. The correspondence consists of letters from school children with historical-related questions, as well as thank you notes for tours of exhibitions or talks. The N-YHS welcomed and accomodated children even during challenging times, such as a school strike in 1968.</p>
                    <p>When America entered World War II, the N-YHS took an active part in efforts at home. In 1942, N-YHS formed the Museums Committee of the American Red Cross War Fund. Comprised of 26 institutions, the Committee took part in a community effort to protect area buildings and people from potential air raids or fires. N-YHS opened a part of its building as a Red Cross surgical dressing unit. Essentially, museum functions were directly affected by the war with considerable staff reductions (resulting in fewer exhibitions), and precautions taken to ensure the safety of collections with off-site storage and the covering of skylights. A.J. Wall (Director) took an active role in collecting information from state organizations in regard to the protection of state records during war time. The correspondence includes rich material concerning these wartime concerns and preparations.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the series, letters provide insight into the production of the various publications produced by the N-YHS, including the Edwin Smith Surgical Papers translated and edited by James H. Breasted, Williams Sawitzky's monograph on the artist Ralph Earl, and N-YHS's 
                        <emph render="italic"> Dictionary of Artists in America 1564-1860</emph> (George C. Groce and David H. Wallace). Included among these publications are the
                        <emph render="italic"> Quarterly</emph> journal, reports, annual reports, and meeting minutes. Financial and real estate matters will give researchers a sense of the decisions the institution made over the years with regard to purchases, sales, and other matters (e.g. mortgage certificates, sales of properties owned by N-YHS, investments, securities, and taxes). Frequent correspondents concerning finances include N-YHS Treasurers Frederic D. Weekes, R. Horace Gallatin, Thomas Streeter, George Zabriskie, and William Van Alstyne. Bequests are noted in the series, as are additions to significant library collections (e.g. those from Bella C. Landauer, Leonidas Westervelt, Thomas O. Mabbott, Katherine Prentis Murphy, and Harold Seton).</p>
                    <p>Further information about documents and correspondents identified by the processing archivist as being of substance and/or significance to N-YHS institutional history or historical thought are identified in folder-level notes in the container list.</p>

                    <head>Arrangement Note</head>
                    <p>The series is in original order. Although the central correspondence files were maintained in alphabetical order by correspondent, it appears that at various points in time the files were emptied of most older correspondence and new alphabetical files were started with new incoming letters. Consequently, the series includes 18 of these “sets” or batches of correspondence, each set advancing chronologically from 1908 to 1982. Each set holds at least two years of correspondence (e.g., 1927-1929; 1930-1932), but several hold more years (e.g., 1960-1963; 1975-1979). This is especially true of the first set which ranges from 1908 to 1926. In order to keep a reviewer oriented to which set they are viewing in the container list, the entries include an opening reference (e.g., Correspondence 1908-1926. Bab – Bap; Correspondence 1946-1947. As-Az). In short, a researcher looking for correspondence to/from John Doe over an extended period of time will need to look for the “D” folder under multiple sets/time periods.</p>

                    <p>These materials bring together various general topics on issues that the N-YHS was involved with in the early 20th century, as well as matters that involved the institution directly.The bulk of materials consist of correspondence, however, there are also other formats such as index cards, photostats, newspaper clippings, and personal notes written by staff members.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Almanac Requests</emph> (6 folders): This collection consists of correspondence, lists, photostats, index cards, and two notepads that A.J.Wall (Assistant Librarian, N-YHS) received and created for his survey on almanacs published in New York between 1694 and 1850. As the collection consists of such varied formats, the collection contains four separate entries in the finding aid. The 3 x 5 index cards were sent to A.J. Wall from outside libraries and institutions, and these cards contain the bibliographical information of the almanac (title, year, page number) and printer information. Many cards contain extensive information about the almanacs (such as Leeds, Poor Roger, and Poor Thomas Improved), and descriptions of advertisements as they appeared in the almanac. Several cards contain abbreviations for all the institutions that provided information, and these abbreviations are listed on the lower portion of many cards received by the N-YHS. A folder labeled Miscellaneous contains materials such as notepads that Wall used to capture information and photostats of

                        <emph render="bold">Castle Clinton Matter </emph> (6 folders): This collection consists of letters, newspaper clippings, radio addresses, and other materials that document the efforts of N-YHS to preserve the building known as the West Battery, Fort Clinton, Castle Clinton, Castle Garden, and, finally, the Aquarium following the aquarium's relocation in 1941. The majority of the collection consists of correspondence between N-YHS and other historical, city, and state organizations that supported the preservation of the building, and a movement was formed to block the Commissioner of Parks Robert Moses's plan to demolish Castle Clinton. One organization, The Fine Arts Federation of New York (FAFNY) sponsored a competition for designs of Battery Park in response to the plans proposed by Moses and the Parks Department. Correspondence between the N-YHS and FAFNY discuss this competition, and the potential for the N-YHS to preserve the designs for future use or interest. Included are a Program of Competition for the Selection of an Alternative Design for the Development of Battery Park and a folded plan entitled 
                        <emph render="italic">Site Plan of Battery Park for the Purposes of This Competition</emph> [a second copy of this plan is available in the N-YHS main collection] in Folder 3.</p>
                    <p>The collection also includes two sets of index cards of alphabetical listings of names and addresses of those who sent in letters and were involved in protests for Saving the Aquarium; some index cards also include quotations in support of preservation and suggestions to the N-YHS in its quest to preserve the building. While Moses would determine the fate of the building upon completion of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, he did not feel the building was “worth restoring.” There is extensive correspondence between the N-YHS and the Board of Estimate (a governmental body responsible for budget and land-use decisions), and includes the stenographic record of the proceedings before the Board of Estimate on October 11, 1945 with participation of Commissioner Moses, R.W.G. Vail , George A. Zabriskie, and George McAneny (President, American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society). Of interest is a June 26, 1941 radio address given by A.J. Wall (Director, N-YHS) to "Save the Aquarium Building," in which Wall condemns the proposed removal of the aquarium and subsequent destruction of the fort as concerning not only the city but the nation as a whole. Wall encouraged those listeners also opposed to the destruction to write to the N-YHS, and those letters are located in Folder 1. Other notable correspondents include Harold I. Ickes (Secretary of the Interior), Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, J.A. Krug (Secretary of the Interior), Mayor William O'Dwyer, Hugo E. Rogers (President, Borough of Manhattan) and R.W.G. Vail (Director, N-YHS).</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Requests for "Famous Historical Personages &amp; Scenes"</emph> (7 folders): The materials in this collection consist of chronologically arranged letters and index cards from various schools and teachers across the country requesting a series of 62 illustrations of "Reproductions of Famous Historical Personages &amp; Scenes." Among the illustrations were distinguished Americans and relics contained in the N-YHS collection. The reproductions were sent free of charge to all schools (many of them rural) who requested them. In addition to teachers and educators, lawyers, engineers, and other disciplines requested the illustrations. Organizations such as the Young Men's Christian Association and Brooklyn Children's Museum in New York are also examples of institutions that requested these illustrations. Several letters in Folder 3 were kept together, as these were requests by students putting together scrapbooks of New York in their classes. Box 357 consists mainly of 3 x 5 index cards of requests sent between 1936 and 1939 from schools and teachers from around the country for the set of illustrations. N-YHS responded fairly quickly to these requests, however, at times there was a time lapse in responding due to a shortage of the materials available.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Thompson Property at East Hampton, Long Island</emph> (9 folders):</p>
                    <p>This collection consists primarily of correspondence and attendance records as well as other materials such as service estimates, expense statements, architectural drawings, and exhibition brochures. Early correspondence exchanged between A.J. Wall, (Director, N-YHS), realtors, The Bank of New York, and others discusses the closing on the property by the N-YHS, insurance (fire and war damage), and tax policies. There is extensive correspondence between the numerous caretakers and the next Director of the N-YHS, A.J.Vail, on the general maintenance of the property (landscaping, grounds), costs related to heating the building, salaries of employees hired to care for the property and collections, and other personnel related matters. Reports sent from Garrett H. Winter (Superintendent, N-YHS) informed the Director of any issues at the homestead either related to the property itself or with staff. There is also correspondence about donations made to the museum and letters exchanged with the 
                        <emph render="italic">East Hampton Star,</emph> a local paper to publicize the homestead and its exhibitions. Other correspondence discusses the setting up of the museum to welcome student groups, Girl Scouts, and organizations such as the East Hampton Women's Club. The museum's curator, Katherine Wellenkamp, and Donald A. Shelley (Curator of Paintings and Acting Museum Curator) exchanged several letters in regard to attendance records, and the tensions that arose between Wellenkamp and the caretakers Mr. and Mrs. Testa. Wellenkamp also promoted the museum in the community through publicity in the local paper, the

                        <emph render="italic">Annual Guide Book of the Long Island Association.</emph>. Several highlights include a brochure of the Thompson Homestead Memorial containing a brief history and summary of each exhibition room and several letters discussing the donation of three spoons dug up on the property from Native American graves when the house was being erected in Folders 6-7.</p>

                    <p>The materials in this collection consist of correspondence between the N-YHS and the Internal Revenue Service's Treasury Department concerning tax-exempt status and the documentation to maintain that status over the course of several decades. Included are letters in regard to Section 214 (a) (10) of the Revenue Act of 1924, Section 231 (6) of the Revenue Act of 1926, Section 101 of the Revenue Act of 1936, and section 170(b)(1)(A) (vi) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

                    <p>This series consists of seven distinct topics that were discovered separately from the earlier correspondence records in Series I-IV. These materials bring together various general topics on issues that the N-YHS was involved with, such as Castle Clinton, as well as matters that involved the institution directly. These aforementioned materials include patron requests, tax information, and a satellite museum located in Long Island during the 1940s. The topics and their respective historical notes are listed as follows:</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="bold">Almanac Requests</emph> (6 folders): In 1917, A.J. Wall (Assistant Librarian, N-YHS) began compiling a survey of almanacs published in New York covering the years 1694-1850 for his book, 
                        <emph render="italic">A List of New York Almanacs, 1694-1850</emph> published in 1921. In conducting his survey, Wall contacted many repositories across the city, state, and country, including universities (such as the University of Pennsylvania, Yale University Library, Rutgers College Library) and historical societies (American Antiquarian Society, Essex Institute, Historical Society of Pennsylvania). Wall was interested in the following information: titles, compilers' names, imprint, and paging of the almanac. Included in this series is a draft of the book that offers insight on the results of Wall’s efforts located in Folder 9. In the draft’s preface, Wall stated that a number of almanacs prior to 1800 did not survive, however this information was still included in the book. Wall also noted in the preface that almanacs "reflected the spirit of the times," and provided not only weather predictions but entertainment and scientific knowledge.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="bold">Castle Clinton Matter</emph> (6 folders): Fort Clinton was built in 1807 and designed by architect John McComb, who designed City Hall. The fort was built to pair with a similar fort on Governors Island in anticipation of the War of 1812. Named in honor of Mayor Dewitt Clinton, Castle Clinton chiefly served to keep the enemy out of New York’s inner harbor during the war. In 1823, the castle was renamed Castle Garden. Between 1823 and its closing in 1941, the Castle served many functions as a center of the city's public and social life, first as a place of entertainment and then for the latter half of the 19th century as an immigration center that welcomed immigrants to America. Finally, from 1890-1941, the building housed the New York Aquarium that welcomed close to two million people annually.</p>
                    <p>Following the relocation of the Aquarium to Coney Island in 1941, Castle Clinton closed and its fate was left in question. While the structure was extensively altered and roofed over to a height of several stories, the original masonry fort remained. The building was subsequently threatened to be demolished by the Commissioner of Parks Robert Moses to make way for the construction of a Brooklyn-Battery Bridge and redesigning of Battery Park. Together with public sentiment and the support of many influential historical institutions and museums across the country, the N-YHS took on an active role in preventing the destruction of Castle Clinton. Staff members such as A.J. Wall (Director, 1937-1944), R.W.G. Vail (Director, 1944-1960), George A. Zabriskie (President, 1939-1947) took part in hearings, organized committees, and wrote articles to newspapers publicizing the issue. Due in large part to these efforts, the building was saved and designated a Historic Landmark in 1946. Castle Clinton was restored to its original design by the National Park Service and in 1975 the landmark reopened as Castle Clinton National Monument.</p>
                    <p>The N-YHS formed a committee consisting of various representatives of historical institutions (including the State Historical Association and the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society (ASHPS) to consider the preservation of Castle Clinton and other historic buildings in New York. A movement to evoke public opinion to save the building was spearheaded by Robert Cameron Beadle, Publisher and Editor of the Manhattan Chronicle, in the formation of the "League to Save Fort Clinton," a volunteer membership organization designed to save the building from destruction. Many of the League's efforts were publicized through articles written in the Manhattan Chronicle, and led to signed petitions by the public. Construction of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel ceased during the years America engaged in World War II, and when construction resumed in 1945, the N-YHS once again took efforts to prevent the demolition of Castle Clinton. When the New York City Tunnel Authority altered the ventilating shafts from the site of the fort to the center of Battery Park, the N-YHS argued that this relocation removed the grounds for destroying the fort (a suggestion proposed in 1942). In light of this information, the N-YHS requested that the Board of Estimate withdraw any "permission it may have given to demolish Castle Clinton." In August 1946, Congress passed H.R.5125 authorizing the establishment of Castle Clinton as a National Monument.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Requests for "Famous Historical Personages &amp; Scenes"</emph> (7 folders): Between the years 1928-1939, the N-YHS made available free of charge to schools and educators across the country (plus shipping expenses) a series entitled, "Reproductions of Famous Historical Personages &amp; Scenes." This set of 62 illustrations was considered a valuable resource in the classroom and school library, particularly for rural schools, that engaged students in American history. Many schools subscribed to the National Educators Society and International Index File from the Executive’s Guild, services which listed materials sent free to schools by various governmental agencies and business organizations. Other disciplines, such as lawyers and engineers, also requested these illustrations. These illustrations were often mounted in classrooms or used during class to illustrate historical lessons and talks on various subjects, and several schools made these sets available in their school libraries to be examined by both faculty and students. Many of the requests came from Oklahoma, as recommended by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. Teachers and schools were very appreciative of this gesture in thank you letters of appreciation for these illustrations that would assist in bringing to life the history of the United States and engaging students.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="bold">Thompson Property at East Hampton, Long Island</emph> (9 folders): In 1941, the N-YHS purchased property located on Ocean Avenue in East Hampton, Long Island, to create a satellite museum that would operate during the summer months. The property belonged to Charles G. Thompson who himself purchased the property in 1893 from the Satterthwaite Estate. Alterations were made on the property between 1803-1894 from plans furnished by McKim, Mead &amp; White, Architects. The house was a two and a half story, semi-colonial dwelling containing 16 rooms and three baths, and the two acre property included a barn. The N-YHS named the house the Thompson Homestead Memorial, and opened it as an extension of the main institution dedicated to American history. A dedication ceremony was held on July 25, 1942, in which the Mayor Judson L. Banister, President of N-YHS George Zabriskie, and many N-YHS staff and friends of the society attended the dedication.</p>
                    <p>Over the course of its existence as a museum, there were several caretakers of the property and are listed in order of employment: Nelson Osborne, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Howe, Mr. and Mrs. John Weinman, and finally, Mr. and Mrs. Louis Testa. The caretakers took attendance, maintained the home, and kept A.J. Wall (Director, N-YHS) apprised on the condition of the estate, landscaping changes, weather activity, and personnel matters. A.J.Wall was also made aware of any issues at the property through reports sent by Garrett H. Winter (Superintendent, N-YHS). At this time, the N-YHS also hired Katherine S. Wellenkamp as Curator of the Thompson Homestead Memorial, and among her tasks was the submission of attendance records to Wall. Wellenkamp also promoted the museum in the community through publicity in the local paper, the
                        <emph render="italic"> East Hampton Star</emph>, and left postcards in area hotels for out-of-town visitors. In addition to out-of-town visitors, the museum welcomed students and organizations such as Girl Scouts, and served as a meeting place for the East Hampton Women’s Club. When it was open, the museum would have several exhibitions on display with themes such as early New York and costumes and relics of American Indians. During fall and winter months, the N-YHS Museum Committee closed the homestead as it was challenging to secure coal during these months while the country was at war. Summer attendance remained low, and in 1946 the N-YHS decided to sell the property as it had become expensive to maintain. During the process of selling the homestead, several letters from various realtors informed the N-YHS that the asking price was steep, and therefore made the property difficult to sell at the original asking price near $40,000. The asking price was reduced to $25,000 and eventually sold in June 1946 to Ivan Barrington White, and household goods from the museum were sold to N-YHS staff members.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="bold">U.S.Treasury Department--Tax Exempt Material</emph> (9 folders): The N-YHS was recognized as an educational institution by the state in 1928 (established when the State Legislature passed Chapter 208 of the Laws of New York State for 1928), even though Federal laws already recognized the institution as educational and therefore tax-exempt. The N-YHS considered itself an educational institution for the following reasons: it was open free to the public; maintained a library; art gallery and museum; provided lectures for members and their friends; public and private schools brought its students to the library as part of the school curriculum; and that the library was used by students from all over the world. With this state law, bequests became tax-exempt, and this led to many years of generous donations. To achieve tax exempt status, or to determine "the deductibility of contributions to the N-YHS", the institution was required to submit its purpose, activities, and affidavit showing the character of the organization, financial statements showing the sources of its income and its disposition (among other requests) and attach the institution's charter or articles of incorporation and bylaws. Upon receipt of this information, a ruling would be made. The N-YHS maintained its tax-exempt status for many decades, and in the late 1960s filed a letter with the U.S. Treasury Department requesting a ruling that N-YHS qualified as a "publicly supported" organization under section 170(b)(1)(A) (vi) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>

                        <p>In 1917, A.J. Wall (Assistant Librarian, N-YHS) began research to compile a list of almanacs covering the years 1694-1850 published in New York. In conducting his survey, Wall contacted many repositories across the city, state, and country asking them to check their collections to see if they held any almanacs published in New York. The bulk of these materials are from 1918, and consist of the research for a book that Wall ultimately published in 1921 entitled,
                            <emph render="italic"> A List of New York Almanacs, 1694-1850.</emph> Wall reached out to 75 libraries and private collections, and relied on the assistance of these librarians to supply data concerning their collections. Wall was interested in the following information: titles, names of compilers, imprint, and paging of the almanac. Included is a draft of the book dated 1920 in Folder 9 that offers insight on the results of Wall’s efforts.
