    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Bronx Teen Resource and Referral Network, formerly the Bronx Teen Pregnancy Network, was established in February, 1983, as a result of the large number of teen pregnancies in the area. The Network functioned as a self-selected coalition of organizations, institutions, individuals, whose primary objectives were: the provision of information and referrals, identification of gaps in services, establishing a linkage system which would expedite appropriate and effective referrals and serve as a forum for resource sharing and joint planning and activities. The idea came from a group of social workers who decided to set up a Network in each of the five boroughs. The Bronx Teen Resource and Referral Network was the last one to survive.</p><p>The mission of the Bronx Teen Resource and Referral Network was to promote communication, networking, coalition-building and support among service providers and youth; and serve as a resource for the provision of education, cultural enrichment, research, technical assistance in support of service needs of young adults. Information and referrals, resource sharing, delivery and coordination of services, education, training, and advocacy are major goals of the Network. They had a quarterly newsletter that was tied to the information given at the Network meetings.</p><p>The Bronx Teen Resource and Referral Network closed in January 1996 because of lack of funding.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>This collection consists of the records of the Bronx Teen Resource and Referral Network from its founding in 1983 to its closure in 1996.  The largest portion of the collection relates to the organization's unceasing search for funds (contracts, grants, proposals, and related material).  However, there is also significant coverage of the Network's activities and programs that provided education, support, and guidance to teenagers in the Bronx, particularly on the topics of pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases.  The files of executive director Agnes Cooper Dennis are especially well-represented, as is the Better Bronx for Youth program.</p>  </scopecontent>
