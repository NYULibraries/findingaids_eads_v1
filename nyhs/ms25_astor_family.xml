<p>For years, the Astor family was the wealthiest family in the world thanks to both the fur trade and real estate market.  </p><p>The Astor family was established in New York City by John Jacob Astor in 1784.  Although Astor bought his first piece of land in 1799, he derived most of his wealth from his American Fur Company (founded in 1808) until the 1830's.  At that point, foreseeing the rapid northward expansion of New York City, Astor began to buy and develop large tracts of Manhattan real estate.  </p><p>His son, William Backhouse Astor, followed in his father's footsteps, and was rumored to know every single inch of land in his possession -- not as farfetched as it sounds, as he kept precise books detailing these properties which can be found in this collection.  </p><p>The Astor family largely remained in New York, although in 1891, William Waldorf Astor moved his family to Britain, creating an Astor lineage in Europe. Even after moving, William Waldorf Astor kept a close eye on the family's real estate dealings, depending a great deal on correspondence between John Coode-Adams, his London agent, and C.W. Baldwin, his agent in New York.  Many of their letters concerning the business transactions of the Astor family are also found in this collection of documents.  </p><p>The family's land holdings were not limited to New York, and they had properties stretching across the country to Oregon, where there is a city named after the original trading post John Jacob Astor had established in 1811, <emph render="italic">Astoria</emph>, located at the mouth of the Columbia River.</p>  </bioghist>

In March, France declared war on Russia, marking the start of the Crimean War.  Astor's prediction of US neutrality proved true.</p><p>3.William Backhouse Astor's Letterbook, dated 1859-1864.  There are two letters addressed to Salmon P. Chase, the Secretary of Treasury in Abraham Lincoln's cabinet, regarding transfer of moneys.  (Pages 187 and 278) In a letter to his friend Robert Neilson in November, 1862, Astor makes references to the new form of currency (the 'Greenback') that had been released in April of that year and assures him that the banks would be able to cover this expansion.  He also comments that the banks had been the government's principal creditors since the 'rebellion commenced.' Civil War. (Page 270)  In another letter to Neilson, Astor comments on the Astor library, still a relatively new institution at the time, encouraging him to return for a visit as there were more volumes than when Neilson had previously visited it.</p><p>4.

One of the infamous deals made was lending money to his friend Aaron Burr who needed quick cash to flee the country after shooting and killing Alexander Hamilton.

shop in Fulton Market on Bowery Street.  Henry was actually the first Astor to look to real estate for profit, investing the money earned from his business into land, which he later urged John Jacob to do when his younger brother began making a comfortable living for himself.  He and his wife Dorothea were childless and happily took the young man in.  When Henry passed away, he left the control of his estate to John Jacob and are included in the Astor Family Papers.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_ref297_8yt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Henry Astor
