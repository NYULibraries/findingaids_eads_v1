            <abstract id="ref1661" label="Abstract">Sol Gorelick (1916-2004) was a social worker and union activist. He began his career with the City of New York in 1940 as a caseworker at the Brownsville Welfare Center. He would work with the city's welfare departments in Brooklyn until his retirement in 1980, also working at the Boro Hall Center and Fulton Center. The range of city documents maintained by Gorelick include memorandums, correspondence, procedural manuals, and educational materials. They document the city's bureaucratic culture, labor relations, unemployment, social conditions, health and healthcare, and housing in mid-20th century Brooklyn. Gorelick was a union member throughout his career with the city. His longest membership was with the Welfare Local 371 of AFSCME, District Council 37. He was a member during the union's tempestuous 1960s, which saw tense contract standoffs with the city, strikes, competition with the rival Social Service Employees Union, and the eventual merger of the two as the SSEU Local 371. Union materials include those documenting committee and chapter activities, negotiations, and recruitment. Gorelick was also active in professional organizations and advocacy groups, including the National Association of Social Workers and the Brooklyn Tuberculosis and Lung Association. Documents from these organizations and others illustrate how a social worker's activism could span work, union, volunteer, and professional activities.</abstract>

            <p>Sol Gorelick (1916-2004) was a social worker and union activist. He began his career with the City of New York in 1940 as a caseworker at the Brownsville Welfare Center. After an absence to serve in World War II, Gorelick returned to the Department of Welfare. He would work with the department and its successor, the Human Resources Administration, until his retirement in 1980. Gorelick worked at several welfare (also termed income maintenance) centers in Brooklyn including the Boro Hall Center and the Fulton Center, for which he was director.</p>
            <p>Gorelick joined the United Public Workers union when he started with the city. Following the UPW's dissolution amid the CIO's anti-Communist purges, Gorelick would join the Welfare Local 371 (later the Social Service Employees Union Local 371) of AFSCME, District Council 37. During the 1960s Gorelick served as a vice president of DC 37.</p>
            <p>Gorelick was also active in many other profession organizations and advocacy groups, including the National Association of Social Workers and the Brooklyn Tuberculosis and Lung Association.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>These papers document the career, labor activities, and activism of Sol Gorelick.</p>
            <p>The largest series is comprised of documents from government entities concerned with social welfare. Most come from Gorelick's employer, the New York City Department of Human Resources, and its predecessors. These materials document the procedures and results of the city's welfare programs. The city's bureaucratic culture profoundly impacted its relationship with its employees and welfare clients. The resulting body of directives, memorandums, and correspondence show all facets of this experience. Because of welfare's relationship with other areas, the collection also illustrates unemployment, crime, and housing conditions in mid-20th century Brooklyn, with Brownsville being particularly well-represented.</p>
            <p>Gorelick was a member of Social Service Employees Union, Local 371, which represented employees in the City of New York's welfare departments. A significant portion of the collection documents this local, its predecessor unions, and its parent union, AFSCME, District Council 37.</p>
            <p>The collection also gives insight into trends in the profession of social work, and shows how an individual's activism could span work, union activities, and professional organization participation.</p>

            <head>Processing Information note</head>
            <p>The collection was partially processed sometime between acquisition and 2013. By all appearances, multiple individuals worked on the collection. Their level of coordination is unclear, and their interventions may have taken place years apart. Materials were foldered and arranged alphabetically in one series, and a folder-level inventory was published. Processing had not been completed, however. Several boxes were foldered but not included in the inventory, and three boxes were entirely unprocessed. Based on these unprocessed boxes, it appears that the materials likely arrived at the repository roughly sorted by organization, and that the arrangement seen in the inventory and most or all folder titles were archivist-devised.</p>
            <p>The most recent processing actions were undertaken in 2013. At this point all finding aid notes were written and files were arranged in four series. Some folder titles were edited or consolidated for clarity or consistency, but existing folder groupings of materials were largely maintained. Three boxes of entirely unprocessed material were foldered and inserted into the appropriate series. Two of these boxes were mostly material for the City, State, and Federal Social Welfare Programs series and one was for the National Association of Social Workers series. Folders containing personnel files and clients' welfare records were restricted and physically separated from other materials.</p>

                    <p>Sol Gorelick began his career with the City of New York in 1940 at the Brownsville Welfare Center and retired in 1980. During this time, the city's departments concerned with welfare (also termed income maintenance) and social services saw many reorganizations and policy changes based on the city's social conditions, forces within the government, and trends in the field of social work.</p>
                    <p>Consistent with national trends, New York City's government welfare programs were solidified as a result of the New Deal programs of the Great Depression. The 1935 Social Security Act included funds for unemployment and the Aid to Dependent Children program (later Aid to Families With Dependent Children). Funding came from the federal government and states. States and local governments administered the program.</p>
                    <p>By the 1940s, the Department of Welfare was one of many New York City government entities providing social services. In 1966, a merger of various social welfare agencies created the Human Resources Administration. While the Department of Welfare was included in the merger, its commissioner retained some autonomy from the Human Resources Administration until the positions of commissioner and administrator of the Human Resources Administration were finally merged in 1970.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                    <p>This series contains materials from Gorelick's tenure with the City of New York. It primarily consists of City of New York documents, but also contains information and instructions from state and federal social welfare departments. The series contains materials from the 1940s-1980s, but the bulk are from the 1960s-1970s.</p>
                    <p>The City of New York was an extremely bureaucratic entity, an attribute that fundamentally shaped its labor relations with social service employees and the relationship between welfare clients and city employees. The memorandums, directives, and correspondence found here illustrate working conditions of social service employees and processes for administering welfare (also termed income maintenance). Because the need for welfare was connected with many other social issues, these records illustrate social conditions in mid-20th century New York City, including poverty, health, housing, employment, and crime.</p>
                    <p>The Fulton Center, on Willoughby Street in Brooklyn, and the Boro Hall Center on Jay Street in Brooklyn are particularly well-represented. Gorelick held several positions at Boro Hall and was director at Fulton during the 1970s. The Brownsville Center is also represented to a lesser extent. These local centers were where clients interacted with the city's policies.</p>
                    <p>Departments are arranged alphabetically, but due to the evolution of the city government, similar functions are represented by content generated by different departments. The functions of the Department of Welfare would gradually be moved into the Department of Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services, which was created in 1966 and fully consolidated in 1970. The local centers, such as Fulton, Boro Hall, or Brownsville, were at times under the auspices of the Department of Welfare, the Department of Social Services, or the Human Resources Administration.</p>
                    <p>Advocacy and professional organizations for government employees are also included in this series. These include the Department of Welfare's branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Association of Supervisor's of the Department of Welfare. This group, formed "to advance professional growth and to protect the Civil Service rights of members," illustrates the often fine line between professional organization and union activities.</p>

                    <p>Sol Gorelick had a long and active involvement in public social service workers' unions that coincided with a particularly tempestuous period for labor relations with the New York City government.</p>
                    <p>Gorelick joined the United Public Workers union upon starting work at the Brownsville Welfare Center in 1940. The UPW would be expelled from the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1950, during the CIO's anti-Communist purges. In its wake, two unions sprang up to represent workers in New York City's Department of Welfare: the American Federation of Labor-affiliated Social Investigators Union, Local 1193 and the CIO-affiliated American Civic Employees Union, Local 371. With the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955, these two unions came together to found the Welfare Local 371 within the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, District Council 37. Gorelick served as a vice president of DC 37 in the 1960s.</p>
                    <p>The 1960s were a period of great tension between AFSCME and the City of New York. Many caseworkers, particularly at the Brownsville Welfare Center, felt that AFSCME, DC 37 was not aggressive enough in its negotiations with the city. During a 1961 dispute between AFSCME and the city, this group petitioned the city to form a separate union. Happy to undercut AFSCME, the Department of Labor granted the request, and the Social Service Employees Union was formed. In the following years both the SSEU and Local 371 would compete for members in the Department of Welfare.</p>
                    <p>The SSEU called a walkout in 1964, and held a strike in 1964-1965 that Local 371 joined. During this strike Gorelick was sent to jail for resisting a judge's order. The SSEU initiated a sit-in 1966 that DC 37 and the New York City Central Labor Council were eventually dragged into to protect bargaining rights. The subsequent loss of this strike, along with changes to practices in the department, led to the weakening of the SSEU. They began merger talks with Local 371 in 1968. When an agreement was reached in 1969, the Social Service Employees Union, Local 371 was formed within AFSCME, DC 37.</p>
                    <p>Gorelick remained a member of the union until his retirement 1980, and participated in DC 37's community activism beyond that.</p>

                    <p>This series documents Sol Gorelick's union activities during his tenure with the City of New York's social service departments. It contains a wide range of documentation, including meeting minutes, contracts, forms, pamphlets, fliers, newsletters, conference materials, and correspondence. The best represented unions are the Welfare Local 371, the Social Service Employees Union, Local 371, and their parent organization American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, District Council 37.</p>
                    <p>Gorelick joined the United Public Workers union when he joined the Department of Welfare, and there is one folder of materials regarding this union. The Welfare Local 371 of AFSCME, DC 37 (1955-1969) is particularly well-represented. These materials include negotiation documentation, contracts, publications, and committee materials. There are six folders of material on the Social Service Employees Union (1961-1969), that for a time competed with Local 371 for members from the Department of Welfare. In 1969, Local 371 and the SSEU merged. The resulting union, SSEU Local 371 is also well represented. Documentation includes the local's newsletter, chapter and committee materials, and leaflets. The is also a significant amount of material form AFSCME, DC 37, the AFL-CIO-affiliated parent union of Local 371 and SSEU Local 371.</p>
                    <p>There is small amount of additional material from other social service locals, unions outside of the social services, and peace advocacy activities in the trade union movement.</p>

                    <p>Gorelick's involvement in community work and engagement with progressive causes went beyond his professional and union activities. This series documents additional organizations and subjects that Gorelick was involved with or monitored. Types include neighborhood and community organizations, social work professional organizations, nonprofit social service organizations, health and healthcare, politics, peace, and education.</p>
                    <p>The Brooklyn Tuberculosis and Lung Association is particularly well represented. Gorelick was active in the leadership of the organization, and served as secretary and president. Materials are mostly from the 1970s and encompass the full range of organizational and informational documents, including correspondence, pamphlets, the 
                        <title render="italic">In Short</title> monthly newsletter, meeting minutes, audits, clippings, and documents from other organizations concerned with eliminating tuberculosis and smoking.</p>
                    <p>A notable amount of material documents activism in the United States opposed to Augusto Pinochet's 1973 coup in Chile. Social workers' professional organizations, unions, and groups throughout the left advocated for intervention to prevent human rights abuses. These materials contain publications, clippings, correspondence, and other material from groups concerned with the situation in Chile.</p>
