    <abstract id="aspace_b08fe901d0ac9bba568ffe6d8b6e0374">Approximately 100 black-and-white photographs of the construction of the George Washington Bridge (opened 1931), connecting Manhattan with New Jersey, and the Triborough Bridge (opened 1936), connecting Manhattan with the Bronx and Queens. The photographs were taken by Frank J. Trani (1902-1981), a civil engineer for the Port Authority of New York, who worked on both projects. Also present are two periodical clippings that feature a photograph of Trani on the George Washington Bridge, a 442-page report published soon after that span's completion, and digital versions of the physical images in the collection, as well as additional digitized views and biographical documentation.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Frank J. Trani, born "Francesco" Trani in Messina, Sicily, in 1902, came to New York as an infant with his family. A graduate of Cornell University (1924, 1927), Trani worked as a civil engineer for the Port Authority of New York. Among their many infrastructure projects, he was involved in constructing the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel. Trani died in Drexell Hill, Pennsylvania, in 1981. [See his obituary in the <emph render="italic">Philadelphia Inquirer</emph>, Friday 16 October 1981, p. 37, and "The Man on the Bridge," a biographical sketch by his son-in-law, Walter Fox, from the Fall 2011 issue of <emph render="italic">Italian America</emph> (copies of each in Folder 8).]</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of approximately 100 black-and-white photographs (most measure 3 x 5 inches; some are slightly larger or smaller) taken by Frank J. Trani (1902-1981), a civil engineer for the Port Authority of New York. Trani worked on construction of the George Washington Bridge (opened 1931), connecting upper Manhattan with Fort Lee, New Jersey across the Hudson River, and the Triborough Bridge (opened 1936; renamed for Robert F. Kennedy, 2008), connecting Manhattan, the Bronx, and Queens across the Harlem River, Bronx Kill, and East River. The George Washington Bridge photographs, taken between 1928 and 1931, document the raising of its piers, anchorages, and towers, its girders being hoisted into place, and its cables being strung. Trani himself appears in a number of views, one of which illustrates a 1929 article in a periodical called "Construction Methods." The same image, edited to include additional figures, illustrates an undated magazine story called "Strong Arms" (clippings of each publication are found in Folder 2). Supplementing these photographs is a 442-page report replete with maps, diagrams, expenditures, statistics, and images: <emph render="italic">George Washington Bridge Across the Hudson River at New York, N.Y.</emph>, reprinted from <emph render="italic">Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers</emph>, vol. 97 (1933). Trani's Triborough Bridge photographs, taken in 1935, show similar views of the construction methods employed on that project. Refer to the container list for transcriptions of Trani's descriptive captions.</p>  </scopecontent>
