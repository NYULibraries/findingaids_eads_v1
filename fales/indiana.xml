            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Gary Indiana (real name Gary Hoisington) was born in 1950 and brought up in Derry, New Hampshire. He and an older brother were raised by his parents, Cecile and Carol Hoisington. In his twenties, he moved to Berkeley and changed his name to Indiana. After two years, Indiana relocated to Boston, where he worked in various capacities before returning to California, this time to Los Angeles where he wrote for punk zines. After a 1974 car accident, he decided to leave for New York, where he became immersed in the downtown arts scene.</p>
            <p>In the 1980s, Indiana wrote for 
                <emph render="italic">Artforum</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Art in America</emph>, among other magazines. He also acted in a number of German and American films, notably working with Dieter Schidor and other members of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's circle. From 1984 onward, Indiana wrote art criticism for the 
                <emph render="italic">Village Voice</emph>, establishing the uncompromising journalistic style that would become his trademark. During this time he was also very active in the theater, working closely with Bill Rice and Taylor Mead, among others, in both his own plays and others'. Notable plays by Indiana include 
                <emph render="italic">Alligator Girls Go to College</emph> (1979), 
                <emph render="italic">Curse of the Dog People</emph> (1980), 
                <emph render="italic">Phantoms of Louisiana</emph> (1981), 
                <emph render="italic">The Roman Polanski Story</emph> (1981), and 
                <emph render="italic">Roy Cohn/Jack Smith</emph> (1992).</p>
            <p>In the late '80s, Indiana published two short story collections, 
                <emph render="italic">Scar Tissue and Other Stories</emph> (1987) and 
                <emph render="italic">White Trash Boulevard</emph> (1988), immediately followed by his first novel, 
                <emph render="italic">Horse Crazy</emph> (1989). In addition to his critical writing, Indiana published novels throughout the 1990s, often writing fictionalized accounts of real-life murder cases like that of Andrew Cunanan in 1999's 
                <emph render="italic">Three Month Fever</emph>.</p>
            <p>Indiana continues to publish fiction work and write for a variety of publications on art, film, literature, and politics. 
                <emph render="italic">The Guardian</emph> has called Indiana "one of the most important chroniclers of the American psyche."</p>
