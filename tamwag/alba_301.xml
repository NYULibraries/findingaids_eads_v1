    <head>Content Description</head>
<p>The Samuel Waitzman Papers (dated 1937-1945) contain several handwritten journals and notebooks written during Samuel Waitzman’s service fighting for the international brigades in the Spanish Civil War (1937-1938) and letters and clippings sent to his sisters during his deployment as a soldier in Europe during WWII (1943-1945). Waitzman’s journal entries are inconsistent in their frequency, and in many cases the exact date of his entries is difficult to discern. His entries are largely reflective and include detailed descriptions of his day-to-day experiences, rather than a comprehensive account of his time in the Abraham Lincoln Brigades. Correspondence in the collections primarily consists of letters written to his sister Dorothy during World War II, which discuss the fighting Germany and leave time he spent in Paris, France. Waitzman also sent his sister clippings from <emph render="italic">Stars and Stripes</emph>, the daily newspaper of U.S. armed forces in the European Theater operations. Other correspondence includes two letters to his sister Freida “Fritzie,” which discuss the progress of the Allied troops and her upcoming marriage.</p>  </scopecontent>
