    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The bulk of this collection consists of the personal correspondence, both sent and received, of Lieutenant General James Guthrie Harbord, primarily known for both his military career and position as President and Chairman of the Board of Radio Corporation of America (RCA).</p><p>The papers range in date from 1923 to 1947, which roughly spans from the time Harbord accepted his position at RCA to the time he died. The collection was organized and maintained by his secretary, Mary Millea, who worked by his side for nearly 25 years. Though the records were housed in Harbord's office at RCA, the collection does not specifically relate to the business practices or Harbord's employment at RCA.</p><p>Instead, the bulk of this collection is comprised of mail sent to Harbord from either his close companions, often politically active former military men themselves, or solicitations for Harbord's support, endorsement, or participation in various capacities related to his military and RCA careers. Frequent correspondents include General Malin Craig, Colonel John Alexander Cocke, Captain Hamilton F. Corbett, Captain John H. Craige, General Charles G. Dawes, Colonel John Bankhead Magruder, Frank E. Mason, Captain Charles Matthews, General George S. Patton, General Philippe Petain, and General John J. Pershing. Harbord's responses mostly appear via carbon copy, though there are many handwritten notes meant to be transcribed at a later point, and generally appearing in tagalog. Also included are several typewritten drafts of articles, manuscripts, speeches, funding and financial reports, project proposals, and testimonials written on behalf of individuals and/or causes advocated for by Harbord.</p><p>Among the miscellaneous personal contents among the papers are lawsuits against Harbord in his capacity as investor, chairman, or board member of various associations, and an additional lawsuit filed by a former employee of the Harbords who was injured in their home after a fall downstairs in the dimly-lit servant quarters. Other legal and institutional documents include blueprints; university curricula, initiatives, and degree planning, including that of Trinity College, University of Virginia, and West Point among many others; and legislative bill proposals.</p><p>Additionally, a large portion of this correspondence is dedicated to Harbord's extensive involvement in philanthropy, political associations, and extracurricular clubs. His wide ranging areas of interest and commitment are spread across committees as varied as the Senior Golfers Association and the Adventure Society, which sponsored leisure trips and dinners abroad, to the Leprosy Eradication Fund and Moro Educational Foundation, which fundraised for boy schools in the Philippines, as well as the National Republican Club and Sentinels of the Republic, which both sought the incorporation of conservative politico-economic values into U.S. education, government, and military.</p><p>Some of the largest categories of correspondence, in fact, are grouped by subject rather than by correspondent. These sections are banks, bank deposits, congratulations, dinner, expense accounts, memberships, miscellaneous, publicity, Republican campaign, and photographs. "Memberships" is the largest category among them with multiple subsections organized by association, but several of the other categories are also subdivided by topic, occasion, or correspondent. "Memberships" in this collection refers to any association, event, fund, committee, or group which Harbord was directly a member, officer, donor, or contributor of some sort, as well as those that solicited his participation.</p><p>The sheer volume of correspondence in this collection reflects Harbord's status and fame. In nearly every box are requests for Harbord's autograph, photograph, appearance at an event, or input on political, economic, and social issues, specifically related to the Republican campaign and counter-New Deal. Many solicited his advice on the state of U.S. fiscal and military issues. Clearly a well-known and popular figure, Harbord is referenced regularly in newspapers and journals of the time, which appear in this collection through the many different clippings sent to Harbord.</p><p>The correspondence files also contain an array of ephemera from the era including but not limited to poetry; chain letters; dinner menus; hotel, club, gym, and resort brochure; car and travel catalogs; advertisements; postcards; radiograms; Western Unions; photographs; birthday and holiday cards; event invitations; birth announcements; postcards; brochures; political and economic pamphlets often related to war, finance, patriotism, and philanthropy; newspapers; and magazines.</p><p>Letters from several significant correspondents, including General Pershing, Brigadier General Charles Dawes, Dwight Morrow and Theodore Roosevelt, are foldered separately.</p><p>In addition to general correspondence, the collection includes some military papers (cablegrams, diaries, and materials from the Philippines), copies of Harbord's speeches and addresses, and correspondence and other papers relating to Harbord's book "The American Army in France." There is also a diary Harbord kept during WWI and several travel diaries.</p><p>Areas of interest to researchers might include interwar and WWII social milieu; American socialism, nationalism, and imperialism; New York upper class; history of Republican party; development of institutions and philanthropic associations; military culture; and corporate culture and the development of capitalism. There are often frank discussions of cross-class relations, and ethnographic understandings of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, and age which might also be of value to those researching the period.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Early life</emph></p><p>This collection consists of correspondence and other papers of James Guthrie Harbord, a prominent New Yorker, World War I General, and President of the Radio Corporation of America ("RCA"). Harbord was born in Bloomington, Illinois on March 21, 1866. His family then relocated in a covered wagon to Lyon County, Kansas in 1878. A biographical cartoon published in the January 1930 edition of  <emph render="italic">The American Magazine</emph> mentioned that the family moved again so that he and his sisters could attend college. Harbord frequently recounted that during the move, he was personally responsible for leading the family cow 70 miles from the old home in Manhattan, Kansas. </p><p><emph render="bold">Early Military Career 
</emph><lb/></p><p>Harbord graduated from Kansas State Agricultural College in June 1886. He became interested in the military life through his experiences with the college drill squad. Harbord went on to hold every military rank, up to and including major general, and was decorated twelve times.</p><p>He enlisted in the United States Army as a Private on January 10, 1889 and retired as Major General on December 29, 1922, and in the meantime participated in both the Spanish American War and World War I.  On January 10, 1889, he enlisted in Company A, 4th Infantry, and he served as an enlisted man in Washington Territory and Idaho. Harbord was promoted to second lieutenant on July 31, 1891, as number one of the class appointed from the ranks that year, and was assigned to the Fifth Cavalry. In that unit,  he served in Indian Territory, Kansas and Texas. He became a Distinguished Graduate of the Infantry and Cavalry School in 1985. He then served as a Major in the Second U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, the Torrey Rough Riders, raised in the Rocky Mountain States in 1889. On July 1, 1898,  Harbord was promoted to First Lieutenant for the 10th Cavalry on July 1, 1898, serving in Alabama and Texas. He received his first overseas appointment in Cuba, in the Adjutant General Departments of Santiago, Puerto Príncipe, and Eastern Cuba.</p><p>On January 21, 1899, he took an extended leave to marry Emma Yeatman Ovenshine, daughter of Brigadier General Samuel Ovenshine. He also served in the Philippines as Assistant Chief of the Philippines Constabulary from 1903 to 1913, until terminating service with the Philippines Government under the operation of the "Manchu Law" on January 1, 1914. Various papers and  articles on the Philippines are included in the collection. In 1914, he commanded the unit defending the California border at Calexico. In 1916, he was on the Mexican border with General John J. Pershing, pursuing Pancho Villa. </p><p><emph render="bold">Service During World War I
</emph><lb/></p><p>Harbord is perhaps best known for his service in World War I. A significant portion of the correspondence in the collection contains anecdotes about the War as well as personal letters to  his wartime colleagues. He attended War College in Washington between 1916-17 and was then selected by Colonel Roosevelt as a Brigade Commander in the division which Roosevelt hoped he would be allowed  to raise for World War I. When this plan did not materialize, he accompanied General Pershing to France, at the same receiving a promotion to Lieutenant Colonel on May 15, 1917. He served as such during the period of organization of the American Expeditionary Forces until May, 1918, and received another promotion to Brigadier General, National Army, in August, 1917. Assigned to the Marine Brigade of the 2nd Division in May, 1918, General Harbord commanded it in the Verdun Sector and during the fighting in the Bois de Belleau and at Bouresches, during the stand of the 2nd Division near Chateau Thierry, which stopped the German advance on Paris in June 1918. He was then promoted to Major General, National Army and assigned to the Second Division on July 14, 1918, serving as commander during the Soissons Offensive in the great battles of July 18th and 19th. </p><p>In recognition of his ability for organization, General Harbord, on July 29, 1918, was assigned to command the important Services of Supply. His effective work aided materially the efficiency of the A.E.F., and he continued in this command until May, 1919. He was then re-appointed Chief of Staff, A.E.F., and served in this capacity until August, when he was sent by the President of the United States to the Near East as Chief of the American Military Mission to Armenia. </p><p>The collection includes correspondence with General MacArthur, General Pershing, General Patton, General Petain of France, as well as other key military figures of the 20th Century. </p><p><emph render="bold">RCA Years
</emph><lb/></p><p>After several other domestic appointments, Harbord retired from the military on December 29, 1922 to become President of the Radio Corporation of America. This was perhaps a disorienting move for Harbord, because he apparently didn't even know that RCA existed when Owen Young first asked him to become director. He twice declined, but finally accepted the position, thereby  giving up any opportunity he may have had to receive the highest military title. He accepted the position after Secretary of War Weeks pointed out the great service he could render by improving the nation's communication facilities. After seven years as President, he was made Chairman of the Board of Directors of RCA on January 3, 1930. Several important developments occurred at RCA while Harbord was Chairman. In 1926, RCA began television broadcasts and formed NBC, and in 1928, RCA was one of four corporations that jointly formed RKO Pictures. In 1929, RCA acquired the Victor Talking Machine Company (maker of the "Victrola") and became RCA-Victor.  He held numerous other directorships, including the directorship of New York Life Insurance Company and  the Santa Fe Railroad.  Harbord also received a lot of attention in the popular press after he joined RCA, and was the subject of numerous magazine articles and biographies. Harbord retired from the position in 1930. </p><p>During his years as a civilian, he enjoyed traveling, both abroad and in the western United States, riding, golf, and spending time with extended family. Harbord had no children of his own. While he was Chairman of RCA, Harbord lived on Dogwood Lane in Rye, New York. His first wife died of tuberculosis in 1937, and he married his second wife, Anne Lee Brown, in 1939. In 1925, he wrote a memoir, <emph render="italic">Leaves From a War Diary</emph>, published by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., 1925, which contains his experiences during the War. He also wrote two other books about his wartime experiences: <emph render="italic">The American Expeditionary Forces: its Organization and Accomplishments</emph>, published by Evanston in 1929, and <emph render="italic">The American Army in France</emph>, published by Little Brown &amp; Co. in 1936. Harbord continued to serve in a consulting role for the military during his years with RCA, often receiving requests for his opinion from high-ranking military officers. Harbord remained as Chairman of the Board for RCA until 1947, retiring shortly before his death. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.</p>  </bioghist>

job in the Philippines, and heavily dissuades him from taking the mayorship of NYC, given that he already has all the important commercial and political connections from RCA post)/ Also include Harbord's draft of a eulogy for Pershing, whose death was in 1948. In it, he mentions the tragic fire at el Presidio, Pershing's earlier home: "I was at the Presidio of San Francisco during the tragedy which in 1915 robbed [Pershing] of his young wife and three little girls."</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref1230_2vc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence with General Pershing</unittitle><unitdate>1940-1941</unitdate><container id="aspace_18f4eaaea9f4ec2f3ca297eb0ecae2b8" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 8454]" type="Offsite-Box">54</container><container parent="aspace_18f4eaaea9f4ec2f3ca297eb0ecae2b8" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1231_g0v" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence with General Pershing</unittitle><unitdate>1936-1939</unitdate><container id="aspace_8d949c3fcbb478474572c4279a38c762" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 8454]" type="Offsite-Box">54</container><container parent="aspace_8d949c3fcbb478474572c4279a38c762" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1232_j3q" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence with General Pershing</unittitle><unitdate>1933-1935</unitdate><container id="aspace_284337360c7d00d5f008d8c05418f49e" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 8454]" type="Offsite-Box">54</container><container parent="aspace_284337360c7d00d5f008d8c05418f49e" type="Folder">11</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1233_lo5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence with General Pershing</unittitle><unitdate>1930-1932</unitdate><container id="aspace_7f4a9611eed19bd34c0234f2713fb033" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 8454]" type="Offsite-Box">54</container><container parent="aspace_7f4a9611eed19bd34c0234f2713fb033" type="Folder">12</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1239_cjx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence with General Pershing</unittitle><unitdate>1925-1929</unitdate><container id="aspace_a62116dd4e62327278216a9820e9dc91" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 8454]" type="Offsite-Box">54</container><container parent="aspace_a62116dd4e62327278216a9820e9dc91" type="Folder">13</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1238_xf4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence with General Pershing</unittitle><unitdate>1918-1924</unitdate><container id="aspace_3fe284913514e54ee4ec36741a915a33" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 8454]" type="Offsite-Box">54</container><container parent="aspace_3fe284913514e54ee4ec36741a915a33" type="Folder">14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1241_6l1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Morrow Correspondence </unittitle><unitdate>1926-1930</unitdate><container id="aspace_9bb8df0fe5541869033faf1b400b03b5" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 8454]" type="Offsite-Box">54</container><container parent="aspace_9bb8df0fe5541869033faf1b400b03b5" type="Folder">15</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1242_k6t" level="file"><did><unittitle>Morrow Correspondence </unittitle><unitdate>1924-1926</unitdate><container id="aspace_3ffdcc51a49846162848944d262c0d4d" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 8454]" type="Offsite-Box">54</container><container parent="aspace_3ffdcc51a49846162848944d262c0d4d" type="Folder">16</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1243_c8i" level="file"><did><unittitle>Theodore Roosevelt Correspondence </unittitle><unitdate>1917-1919</unitdate><container id="aspace_e883f3df930fe3baa5d07c6142513171" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 8454]" type="Offsite-Box">54</container><container parent="aspace_e883f3df930fe3baa5d07c6142513171" type="Folder">17</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8003ceb50bdbffd17373c48cd1407f86"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes ten letters from Theodore Roosevelt to Harbord, and one letter from Roosevelt's son Archibald, along with Harbord's responses.

There is also one folder of military photographs and a folder of pamphlets.</p><p><emph render="bold">Cablegrams</emph></p><p>Cablegrams A 813-A 2099 (boxes II.1-2) are cablegrams received by Harbord which primarily relate to personnel concerns. Earlier cablegrams mostly center around logistics (shipments, production, training, payments, replies to queries) while later cablegrams are mostly concerned with discharge, messages to soldiers, and verification of soldier status (location, health, condition, rank, citizenship).</p><p>These cables are organized topically by individual date and labeled with alphanumerical code, typically ranging 1-2 pages in length per topic group. Each cable is subgrouped into numbered paragraphs which represent separate messages. </p><p>Each of these cables is signed by Kerr, McCain, or Harris; several messages from March, Marcorps, Baker; others include Williams, Garfield, Goethals, Keppel, Dockery, Pershing, Crowell, Biddle, Wheeler, Marks. The messages are addressed to "Pershing Amexforce" General Headquarters A.E.F.</p><p>A significant number of cablegrams are absent, noted only by alphanumeric code on otherwise blank sheets, noting that there were "no copies made." Most of these cablegrams refer to "casuals" or "casualties," though others are simply marked "confidential."</p><p>The majority of cablegrams are seeking/relaying orders about personnel; procedure; release of and communication with prisoners; requests for money and/or goods; discharge of soldiers; aid for military families of fallen soldiers; notifications sent to soldiers while abroad (mostly related to death of family members); foreign infantrymen &amp; U.S. naturalization/citizenship (Mexican, Cuban, Swedish, Norwegian, Spanish; Panamanian, Danish, Russian, Colombian, Netherlands, Brazilian, Portuguese, Bulgarian); officers available to work different positions (veterinarian, ophthalmologist, flight surgeon); delays in mail; hospital organization; service award and rank
 announcements; requests for more officers; expense reports; machinery requests; shipments of Christmas presents; deaths from disease; epidemic in France; transportation authorization (including of military wives and children); funds transferred to Commanding General trust in Paris; prevention of disease spread upon reentry to U.S.; new system for baggage records (in response to lost baggage complaints); reassignments/moving of officers; statements to be read to soldiers; missing cabled money to soldier; verification
 of status of health and/or causes of death; Christmas greetings from Baker and March; service records; issues with notifying family of death/illness; uniform regulations; employment of soldiers; YMCA and other welfare organizations; suitable soldiers; special assignments for soldiers continuing military service (ex: American propaganda balloons); hiring of artists overseas for lack of camera coverage; "handling soldiers of enemy-alien birth."</p><p>Cablegrams with prefixes CA and CP (end of box II.2-II.3) include three alternate types of cablegrams different from the above type, though they still follow the chronological and alphanumeric code system. CA  and CP cablegrams are sent via courier rather than cable, and both sets are addressed to the Commander in Chief or Commanding General from the Adjutant General and copied to Harbord in his capacity as Chief of Staff to Pershing. The CP cablegrams are drafts to be reviewed and sent out. Most of the CP cablegrams are in letter-form with much more detailed explanation or requests. </p><p>The first folder in box II.3 is comprised of cablegrams from Pershing to Harbord. These are often denoted as "extract cablegrams" and are also in longer, letter-format. These cablegrams are primarily concerned with logistics about troops and supplies. There are also multiple requests for more men of specific positions and at least one request for women stenographers, typists, and clerks.</p><p>The last three folders in box 3 are comprised of cablegrams received and sent about urgent need either for supplies or conditions of living (primarily in prison or aboard ships). Urgent supply needs include medical, artillery, clothing, uniform, beds, horses, lithographs, and cameras among other materials. Most of the messages are complaints or concerns about morale and/or health risks, but most of these claims are decided to be unfounded.</p><p>SOS (Services of Supply) cablegrams in boxes II.4-II.5 are sent and received directly by Harbord, addressed and signed by him and the Adjutant General. These are primarily concerned with logistics of supplies, specifically artillery, machine, animals.</p><p><emph render="bold">Reports</emph></p><p>Reports and memorandums were generally authored by Harbord and cover a variety of military topics as indicated by the titles in the Box and Folder list.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref847_taf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cablegrams
