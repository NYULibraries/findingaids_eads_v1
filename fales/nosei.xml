            <p>Based in SoHo for fifteen years, Annina Nosei Gallery moved to Chelsea in 1995, closing in 2005. The gallery was instrumental in introducing the work of Neo Expressionist Italian and German figurative painters, as well as young American painters, to a market largely dominated by minimalism and conceptual art. From its inception until its closing in 2005, the Annina Nosei Gallery continued to promote young, emerging artists. 
                <lb/>
                <lb/> Annina Nosei was born in Rome, Italy. She received doctorates in literature and philosophy from the University of Rome, where she studied under the art historian Giulian Carlo Argan and wrote her thesis on Marcel Duchamp. She received a Fulbright in 1964 to study in the United States, where she taught at the University of Michigan and later at UCLA, St. John's University in Manhattan, and Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn. 
                <lb/>
                <lb/> While teaching at UCLA in 1965, Nosei met the art dealer John Weber, to whom she was married from 1966 to 1973. Her first gallery experience was in helping to organize and install exhibitions at Weber's gallery in Los Angeles. In 1979, Nosei began to show and deal art in a loft owned by Larry Gagosian at 421 West Broadway, New York City, across the street from the Leo Castelli Gallery. In 1980, Nosei opened her own gallery in SoHo at 100 Prince Street. In 1995, the gallery moved to 530 West 22nd Street, in Chelsea, and closed in 2005. 
                <lb/>
                <lb/> Nosei is known for being the first dealer to represent Jean-Michel Basquiat from 1981 to about 1983, and for providing him with materials and a space to work in the basement of the gallery. Though known primarily for representing German and American Neo-Expressionists and Italian New Image painters, the Annina Nosei Gallery represented and exhibited a diverse range of artists, such as Ghada Amer, Julio Galan, Tsibi Geva, Graciela Hasper, Barbara Kruger, Robert Longo, Alan McCollum, Shirin Neshat, and Jenny Watson.

            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>Series were created by the archivist based on discussions with Annina Nosei and on a careful appraisal of the material. Each series reflects an explicit function of the Annina Nosei Gallery in its daily activities of taking artworks on consignment; of buying, selling, and shipping artworks; of planning and executing exhibitions in its gallery space as well as at museums, art fairs, and other galleries; and of managing, promoting, and paying represented artists. Every effort was made to retain the original order of the files. The subseries reflect the titles and organization of records by the gallery. 
                <lb/>
                <lb/> Almost all subseries titles were originated by the gallery as it created and maintained its records (and were printed on hanging files in labeled file cabinet drawers or on labeled boxes). The following four subseries were created and named by the archivist in an effort to simplify access, protect materials, and organize miscellany:</p>
            <p>
                <lb/>Series III, Subseries D 
                <lb/>Series III, Subseries E 
                <lb/>Series IV, Subseries G 
                <lb/>Series VII, Subseries C 
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                <emph render="bold">Folders:</emph> Original folders were replaced with acid-free folders. Unless in brackets, all folder titles are taken from the original folder. A folder label in brackets is a label supplied by the archivist, either because the material was not foldered or because the original folder was unlabeled. The archivist has striven to replicate the gallery's naming conventions where they could be discerned.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>Each folder in the archive holds the entire contents of an original folder. If there was more material in an original folder than would fit in a new folder, that material is divided between two or more folders, each folder bearing the original folder's name followed by the convention "[1/4]," "[2/4]," etc. If two different folders share the same name, each will be followed by a number in brackets denoting its position in a series/subseries (e.g., "[1]," "[2]," etc.). 
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                <emph render="bold">Binders:</emph> Unless in brackets, all binder labels are taken from the original binders. All materials separated from binders are foldered according to their original grouping in a single binder sleeve (most of which contained several items). 
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                <emph render="bold">Photocopies:</emph> All thermal paper has been replaced with a photocopied surrogate. Original folders bearing writing have been photocopied, and the photocopy has been placed at the end of the new folder. Items bearing sticky notes were photocopied, the sticky notes were removed, and the photocopies refiled with the originals (usually attached to it with a plastic clip).
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
                <emph render="bold">Dates:</emph> All dates are approximate and provided by the archivist based on a cursory glance at the contents of each folder.</p>

Each entry in each ledger gives the inventory number, the artist's name, the work's title, the date the work was received by the gallery, the year the work was executed, the size of the work, the artist's price, the consignee, the work's medium, the gallery's suggested price, amount owed to the gallery, and the work's current location including to whom it sold or if it was returned to the artist.</p>

                        <p>According to the gallery, Collector's Books and Artist Books are different forms of the same function. At a cursory glance, Collector's Books comprises ledgers that seem to document what artist's work (by invoice number) was sold to what collector (whether individual or institution), while Artist Books comprises small spiral-bound notebooks listing the names, addresses, and phone numbers (sometimes in the form of business cards affixed to the pages) of persons and institutions interested in purchasing the work of certain artists. Often in Artist Books, a name and address will be accompanied by a note that reads "interested in 'X work of art'." 
                            <lb/>
                            <lb/> The ledger sheets in Collector's Book A-I and Collector's Book J-O are from National brand top-lock post binders. Collecto'rs Book P-Z is from a Six Star brand top-lock post binder.</p>

That arrangement has been replicated here at the folder level. The labels "Collector's Book A-I," "Collector's Book J-O," and "Collector's Book P-Z" were copied from labels on the binders themselves.</p>

                        <p>According to the gallery, Collector's Books and Artist Books are different forms of the same function. At a cursory glance, Collector's Books comprises ledgers that seem to document what artist's work (by invoice number) was sold to what collector (whether individual or institution), while Artist Books comprises small spiral-bound notebooks listing the names, addresses, and phone numbers (sometimes in the form of business cards affixed to the pages) of persons and institutions interested in purchasing the work of certain artists. Often in Artist Books, a name and address will be accompanied by a note that reads "interested in 'X work of art'."</p>

                        <p>Folders in this subseries were stored in two different ways: the majority filed alphabetically in filing cabinets and the rest filed by artist in cardboard boxes and letter boxes. Since, according to Annina Nosei, the only reason for the different filing systems was lack of space in the filing cabinets, folders from boxes are interfiled alphabetically with the folders from the filing cabinets.</p>

                        <p>This subseries originally comprised one binder per artist. This original arrangement has been preserved while the visual materials were transferred to new, archivally sound sleeves and rehoused in acid-free binders.
                            <lb/>
                            <lb/>The original binder labels have been reproduced here, except for what appears between brackets ("[ ]"), such information was provided by the archivist for ease of use.
                            <lb/>
                            <lb/>Some transparencies were originally sleeved in mylar, labeled, and placed in one of eight numbered pockets in a single mylar sleeve. For preservation reasons, the original sleeve was discarded. The transparencies are placed in archivally sound plastic sleeves, and a note is included that reproduces the original numbering, usually in the form, "From Binder Sleeve Pocket Numbered 'x.'"
                            <lb/>
                            <lb/>Many of the original sleeves in the binders contained several [elements]. Each [element] has been separated out, placed in its own sleeve, and placed in a new binder following a cover sheet giving the original binder sleeve's order (e.g., Binder Sleeve 2/7), the series and subseries, and the name of the artist as it appeared on the original binder.
                            <lb/>When an original sleeve or binder pocket contained a large majority of paper-based [elements], everything in that sleeve or pocket was removed and placed in a folder that can be found in ["Subseries D: Material Separated"]. 
                            <lb/>
                            <lb/>If the original sleeve or pocket contained a large amount of photographic material as well as paper-based material, then the paper material is removed to a folder labelled with the binder's name followed by the phrase "
                            <emph render="italic">From</emph> Binder Sleeve x/y," and the photographic material is resleeved and arranged as described above.
                            <lb/>In some cases, a binder sleeve with four pockets will contain four or more 3"x5" transparencies in plastic sleeves with a card or sticker taped to the sleeve giving the piece's name and dimensions. Each individually sleeved transparency is taken out of its sleeve and placed in an archival three-pocket mylar sleeve. The original plastic sleeve, if it has bears notations, is placed in the same sleeve as the transparency, along with the card or sticker that bears infomation on the artwork pictured.</p>

                        <p>Subseries comprises material separated from Series III, Subseries C, due to some aspect of the material that made it unsuitable to be placed in a binder.</p>

                        <p>The order of folders in this subseries follows the order of binders in Series III, Subseries C. Each folder represents one binder sleeve; for example, when all the material has been removed from the ninth sleeve of the "Pizzi Cannella" binder in Subseries C, it is placed in a folder, which is then labeled "Pizzi Cannella [Binder Sleeve 9/12]." When only 
                            <emph render="italic">some</emph> of the material is removed from a sleeve, it is noted in the folder title as "[From Binder Sleeve x]" (e.g., Pizzi Cannella [From Binder Sleeve 4/12]").</p>

                        <p>Polaroid photographs were originally sorted with dividers. The original order has been maintained, including the dividers. The labels of the dividers have been preserved here. Where Polaroids from one artist were found under another artist's label, or when there are no labeled dividers (as in the beginning of Binder BC), the artist's name has been provided in brackets by the archivist to aid the researcher.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Exhibition Records:</emph> Subseries A-G comprise what the gallery termed "Exhibition Records," a term denoting all materials produced and collected in connection with a specific exhibition. These records were originally sleeved in binders. Material has been removed from binder sleeves and binders and placed in folders and boxes. Titles of binders have been retained in the titles of subseries. 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/> Materials in these subseries are arranged in the order in which they were filed in their original binders, which is reverse chronological order for each binder. The binders (subseries) themselves have been ordered chronologically by the archivist. 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/> Each folder represents a specific exhibition (e.g., all of the material relating to the Barbara Kruger March 5-26, 1983 show is put into one folder), regardless of how many binder sleeves the material orignally occupied. Most binders were accompanied by a list of binder contents listing the exhibitions included in the date range for that binder. These lists, where available, were used by the archivist to create folder titles. Where these lists were absent, the archivist has supplied folder titles by referring to the chronological lists found in the yearly catalogs for the gallery. 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/> Some consecutive exhibitions are represented by very little material. In such a case, that material is placed in a single folder, which is labelled with the artists' names and show titles separated by semicolons (e.g., "[Stephen Mueller; Keith Milow; Group Show; Keith Haring]"). 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/>
                        <emph render="bold">Catalogs:</emph> Subseries H comprises catalogs created by the gallery to accompany each exhibition. 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/>
                        <emph render="bold">Guest Books:</emph> Subseries I comprises guest books signed by gallery patrons.</p>
