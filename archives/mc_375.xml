    <head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head>
<p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl. Certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content. Full-Text searches of archived websites are available at https://archive-it.org/organizations/567.</p><p>Facebook is inconsistently captured and plays back. Majority of 2022 Facebook crawls were performed with Webrecorder to resolve capture problems from initial captures.</p>  </phystech>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>Websites were initially selected by Aleksandr Gelfand from September 2013-January 2014 through the use of Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Intial description and processing of this collection was performed in Archive-It by Aleksandr Gelfand and Shannon McDonald in circa 2014. The collection is made up of four Archive-It collections: Student Blogs Web Archive, Student Organization Event Ephemera Web Archive, Student Organization News Web Archive, and Online Communities Web Archive. In 2022, the four collections were arranged into four series in ArchivesSpace and description was standardized across the collection.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains websites related to student organizations and activities at New York University, the bulk of which come from 2013-2015. Blogs and other websites cover news from around the university and New York City, as well as advice for current and prospective students. Some websites cover events that student organization put together, as well as NYU student organizations in the news. News coverage includes topics such as NYU Greek life, NYU alumni, the Objectivist Club, and LGBTQIA+ community. Events include music and theater performances, club meetings, fundraisers, and conferences. There are many Facebook pages in this collection, modelled off websites and blogs such as Craigslist Missed Connections, Humans of New York, or Overheard in New York but about NYU and its students.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>This collection was created by the University Archives in 2013 to collect a sampling of student organization activities in the mid 2010s. The websites in the collection were derived from club lists found at the Office of Student Affairs, yearbooks, and Google search results.</p>  </bioghist>
