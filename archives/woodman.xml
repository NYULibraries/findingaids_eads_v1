            <head>Biography of Joseph Edmund Woodman</head>
            <p>Joseph Edmund Woodman was a professor of geology at New York University's School of Engineering for 29 years. Born in Newbury (now West Newbury), Massachusetts on July 4, 1873, Woodman received his preparatory education from Phillips Andover and graduated in 1892 with majors in both Arts and Science. He attended Harvard University for his undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees. After the completion of his studies, he was appointed Professor of Geology at Dalhousie University, where he became a full professor and head of the department. He excelled in the field of geology and eventually became a mining geologist before succeeding James J. Stevenson as Professor of Geology at NYU. During his time at NYU Woodman became a pioneer in his field, writing extensively on geology, meteorology and aeronautical meteorology. From 1926 to 1938, he held a special lectureship in meteorology, and from 1935 to 1938, he served as a director of NYU's meteorological observatory. He eventually became the head of the Department of Geology and was named Professor Emeritus of Geology upon his retirement. Woodman was respected by both his colleagues and his students, as is exemplified in the many letters from colleagues and students lamenting his retirement. Woodman passed away on May 19, 1939.</p>
