    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Louis Sherry, a noted "society caterer" in New York City during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, was born in St. Albans, VT in 1855. From a young age he was interested in hotels and restaurants. His first job was as a waiter at the Brunswick Hotel. He brought such dedication to this position that the manager of Hotel Elberon, in Elberon, NJ, took note and invited Sherry to oversee the Elberon's dining room and kitchen during the summer season. Sherry excelled in that appointment, and with the wages he earned he opened his first restaurant in New York City at 36th Street and 8th Avenue. As his goal was to eventually compete with the city's most fashionable restaurants, including Delmonico's, Sherry committed to using only the best ingredients and techniques possible. Sherry embraced innovative approaches to cake and pastry decoration to attract clients, and maintained this growing client base by actively seeking out knowledge about the latest culinary innovations and trends.</p><p>As Sherry's business grew and he began serving numerous members of the elite and "ultra fashionable" New York City "four hundred," he was compelled to move his business uptown three times, finally settling at 44th Street and 5th Avenue. It was at this location that Sherry's status as a society caterer was confirmed when Mrs. Astor held a ball at his establishment. Countless social events, including dances, important dinners and debutante presentations, were held at Sherry's restaurant. Among his patrons were J.P. Morgan, James Hazen Hyde, James Roosevelt, Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt and Mrs. William Vanderbilt. </p><p>Sherry eventually closed his restaurant and ballroom in 1919. Almost immediately Louis Sherry, Inc. was established to continue the catering business, which became a joint venture with the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Sherry passed away due to illness in 1926 at the age of 71.</p>  </bioghist>
