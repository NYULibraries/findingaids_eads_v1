    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The School of Architecture and Allied Arts was established as a department of architecture in 1926 under the leadership of architect E. Raymond Bossange. Two years later, the University established a College of Fine Arts (which the department of architecture was a part of) and elevated Bossange to its deanship in 1930. In 1935, the College was renamed the School of Architecture and Allied Arts. The School was closed in 1941.</p><p>Source:</p><p>"N.Y.U.
