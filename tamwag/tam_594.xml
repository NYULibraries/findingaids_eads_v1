            <p>Victor Navasky, highly regarded journalist, editor, author and educator, is best known for his close association with 
                <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph>, America’s longest continuously published weekly magazine. He was its editor from 1978-1995, publisher and editorial director from 1995-2005, and is now publisher emeritus. He has also written a number of award-winning books and contributed articles and reviews to numerous magazines and journals. Navasky is Professor of Journalism and Director of the George Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism at Columbia University and serves as Chairman of the Columbia Journalism Review.</p>
            <p>Victor Navasky was born in New York City on July 5, 1932, the son of Macy Navasky and Esther (Goldberg) Navasky. His father ran a small clothing manufacturing business in the Garment District. From kindergarten through fifth grade, Navasky attended the Rudolf Steiner School and then the progressive Little Red School House and Elisabeth Irwin High School. After graduating in 1950, he went on to Swarthmore, where he earned Phi Beta Kappa honors and a degree in 1954. His majors were English Literature and Political Science, with a minor in Philosophy. A stint in the Army followed (1954-1956). He was stationed at Fort Richardson in Alaska.</p>
            <p>After his military service, Navasky took advantage of the GI Bill to enroll at Yale Law School, earning his LLB in 1959. While at Yale, he and a friend, Richard Lingeman, started a magazine of political satire, 
                <emph render="italic">Monocle</emph>, which they continued through mail subscription after graduation. They also published 
                <emph render="italic">The Outsider’s Newsletter </emph>and then 
                <emph render="italic">The Radical Sporadical</emph>, with the last issue in 1965.</p>
            <p>Navasky worked for a short time as a speechwriter for G. Mennen Williams, then governor of Michigan, and, after moving back to New York in 1960, began freelance writing for various publications, principally for 
                <emph render="italic">The New York Times Magazine</emph> where he became an editor in 1970. In 1971 Navasky published 
                <emph render="italic">Kennedy Justice</emph>, an account of Robert Kennedy’s tenure as Attorney General. It was a finalist for the 1972 National Book Award. By that time he had started a new book, 
                <emph render="italic">Naming Names</emph>, the outgrowth of an article on the Hollywood Ten that he wrote earlier for 
                <emph render="italic">The New York Times Magazine</emph>. 
                <emph render="italic">Naming Names </emph>would be published in 1980 and win the National Book Award in 1982.</p>
            <p>During the 1970s, while working on 
                <emph render="italic">Naming Names</emph>, Navasky coordinated the New York senatorial campaign of Ramsey Clark, wrote a monthly column (“In Cold Print”) for the 
                <emph render="italic">New York Times Book Review</emph>, and taught for a time at New York University in its adult education program, as well as at a number of other colleges and universities. One course, for example, at Wesleyan University in Connecticut, focused on informers and cooperative witnesses. Navasky was the Ferris Visiting Professor of Journalism at Princeton (1976-1977).</p>
            <p>In 1978, Victor Navasky became editor of 
                <emph render="italic">The Nation </emph> and, in 1995, its publisher and editorial director. Those responsibilities were handed over to Katrina vanden Heuvel in 2005, and Navasky became publisher emeritus.</p>
            <p>In 1984, Navasky (with Christopher Cerf) published 
                <emph render="italic">The Experts Speak: The Definitive Compendium of Authoritative Misinformation</emph> and, in 2008, in a similar vein, 
                <emph render="italic">Mission Accomplished! Or How We Won the War in Iraq</emph>, each book a compilation of the collective wisdom of many individuals presumed to know what they talking about, but who get it very wrong. Navasky won a George Polk Book Award in 2005 for 
                <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion</emph>, part memoir and part meditation on opinion journalism. He released 
                <emph render="italic">The Art of Controversy: Political Cartoons and Their Enduring Power</emph> in 2013. His most recent publication is an eBook, 
                <emph render="italic">The O’Dell File</emph> (2014).</p>
            <p>Victor Navasky has been married since 1966 to Anne (Strongin) Navasky. They live in New York City and have two daughters, Miri and Jenny, and a son, Bruno.</p>

            <head>Processing Information Note</head>
            <p>Upon receipt, the collection had no consistent overall arrangement, although there were numerous groupings of related material. Several file structures existed such as Navasky’s “New Nation” file and a large sequential file focused on opinion journalism. The folders in these groups were not always contiguous. There were several sections of folders that were somewhat alphabetical. Many boxes contained loose material, some unfoldered, while the content of others was clearly arranged and labeled. Related items were often found scattered throughout the boxes, with pockets of discernable organization. These were physically and intellectually brought together and described. A series arrangement was imposed by the archivist based on aggregation of materials with similar titles and related content, creating individual series for major aspects of Navasky’s career and for his published works that are most strongly represented in the collection. Original folder titles were used to the extent possible. Clarification was added as necessary. In addition to the arrangement and descriptive work, a number of items required cleaning. Fragile material was photocopied. The collection was rehoused in acid-free folders. Appropriately sized boxes were utilized for oversized materials some of which had been folded and compressed.</p>

            <p>In 1976, Victor Navasky donated the papers associated with his book, 
                <emph render="italic">Kennedy Justice</emph>, to the John F. Kennedy Library. The collection of more than 22 linear feet contains research materials, drafts, interviews, notes, and correspondence and may be accessed at

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection provides a broad view of Victor Navasky’s life, his interests, and his work. It contains personal items from as early as his time in the third grade at the Rudolf Steiner School, as well as school and military records, family correspondence, and samples of his earliest writings. Material in the collection describes his first venture as an editor and publisher with the satirical journal, 
                <emph render="italic">Monocle</emph>, and recounts the history of 
                <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph> and Navasky’s association with the magazine. Among the books he has written or co-authored, three warranted individual series in the collection -- 
                <emph render="italic">Naming Names</emph> (Viking Press, 1980); 
                <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion</emph> (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005); and 
                <emph render="italic">The Art of Controversy </emph> (Knopf, 2013). Each of these series contains extensive research material and varied products of Navasky's writing process, such as notes, outlines, drafts, typescripts and galley proofs. Much of his other work is represented in the series "Other Navasky Writings," including his first book – 
                <emph render="italic">Kennedy Justice</emph> (Atheneum, 1971). The series also contains articles, essays, plays, and speeches, some with background research and other relevant items. There are materials drawn from Navasky’s continuing career at Columbia University and, also, a large series containing a wide range of subject files representing either research for books, articles, speeches, or lectures, or merely items collected based on Navasky’s personal interests.</p>
            <p>Correspondence appears across the collection, in almost every series. Among the varied items are personal letters; communications with research sources and subjects, and with writers, publishers, editors and others involved in Navasky's many projects and activities. There is also 
                <emph render="italic">Nation</emph> correspondence, both internal and external. Correspondents include many who are well-known, such as William F. Buckley, John Henry Faulk, Henry Kissinger, Molly Ivins, Anthony Lewis, Gus Hall, Elie Wiesel, Merle Miller, Sally and Cedric Belfrage, Hal Holbrook, and Merle Miller. There is also correspondence to which Victor Navasky is not a party. Examples include exchanges involving Albert Maltz, Dalton Trumbo, and Ring Lardner Jr.; also between Alice Orans and Frank Donner. Among the highlights are photocopies of many letters written to early editors of 
                <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph> from such notables as Clarence Darrow, John Maynard Keynes, Felix Frankfurter, H.L. Mencken, Franklin Roosevelt, Margaret Sanger, Cordell Hull, and many others.</p>
            <p>Some of the topics and individuals may be found across multiple series. Navasky's association with 
                <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph>, for example, has its own series but related materials also form a large part of the research for 
                <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion</emph>, and references to 
                <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph> appear in other series as well. Similarly, materials concerning Alger Hiss can be found in numerous places. Although there are brief mentions in the series for the 
                <emph render="italic">Monocle</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Naming Names</emph>, most is to be found in materials associated with 
                <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion </emph> and in the subseries "Articles and Essays – Alger Hiss". There are also Hiss items and research on Soviet espionage in "Subject Files". The Rosenberg Case, another of Navasky's long-time investigative interests, appears in research files for both 
                <emph render="italic">Naming Names</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion</emph>; in the articles subseries (a 1975 book review of 
                <emph render="italic">We Are your Sons</emph>); in subject files; and in the audio-visual material. Among other individuals who may be found across series are Carey McWilliams (
                <emph render="italic">Naming Names</emph>, as well as
                <emph render="italic"> A Matter of Opinion</emph>,) John Henry Faulk, Christopher Hitchens, and Alexander Cockburn. Researchers interested in a specific topic or individual should search across all series.</p>
            <p>The collection contains significant audio-visual material. Of particular interest are audio recordings of a number of interviews Victor Navasky conducted for 
                <emph render="italic">Naming Names</emph> and a special event sponsored by The Nation Institute, "A Conversation with I.F. Stone at 80."</p>

                    <p>The initial series in this collection contains a variety of personal materials as well as biographical articles, resumes, and interviews. There are many items associated with schools Victor Navasky attended, beginning with work he did in the third, fourth, and fifth grades at the Rudolf Steiner School, and continuing through the Little Red Schoolhouse, Elisabeth Irwin High School, Swarthmore and Yale. It is clear from the material that he has continued his involvement with many of these institutions. There are also newsletters, yearbooks, and other items from his summer camp experiences at Camp To-Ho-Ne in the mid-1940s. Correspondence is of a personal nature, much of it consisting of family letters exchanged with his parents whom he refers to as “M &amp; M.” There are military records, along with examples of his early writing while stationed in Alaska. Several folders contain health-related materials, a good deal focused on arthritis. Navasky has dealt with rheumatoid arthritis for many years. Personal ephemera (including family members' ration books from 1943,1944), awards of various kinds, and a number of personal photographs are also included in the series.</p>

                    <p>Because portions of the Camp To-Ho-Ne material were very fragile, it was necessary to create photocopies. The originals are contained in Box 1 Folders 11 and 12; however, researchers should reference the photocopy surrogates located in Folders 13 and 14.</p>

                        <p>This subseries is arranged with other 
                            <emph render="italic">Nation</emph> materials as it provides a look at the magazine's early (pre-Navasky) years. It is likely, however, that its content was gathered as research for Navasky's book, 
                            <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion</emph>, which devotes much attention to the history of 
                            <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph>.</p>
                        <p>Highlights of this material include correspondence (mostly photocopies) associated with previous Nation editors and publishers and involving such notables as Clarence Darrow, Albert Einstein, Fiorello LaGuardia, John Maynard Keynes, Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt, Stephen Spender, Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, and Adolf Hitler. There are also editorial memos; the unfinished draft of a book being written by Freda Kirchway, “The Nation – 1918 to 1958, Outline of a Book”; a variety of articles and speeches; the transcript of an oral history by Carey McWilliams; and a 1939 survey of 
                            <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph> subscribers conducted by Elmo Roper. Materials concerning 
                            <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph>’s financial history are also of interest.</p>

                        <p>Materials in this subseries reference several court cases that involved 
                            <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph>. The most extensively represented case is 
                            <emph render="italic">Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc., et al. v. Nation, et al.</emph>. The case stemmed from the appearance of a verbatim excerpt from a leaked copy of Gerald Ford's unpublished memoir,
                            <emph render="italic"> A Time to Heal</emph>, in the April 7, 1979, issue of 
                            <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph>. The excerpt dealt with Ford's unprecedented pardon of ex-president Nixon. While 
                            <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph> felt that this was "fair use", Harper &amp; Row saw it as copyright infringement. The District Court ruling for Harper &amp; Row resulted in a financial settlement. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, however, reversed that decision. The case was finally settled by the US Supreme Court in Harper &amp; Row's favor. The collection contains documents from all three courts along with other materials related to the case.</p>

                        <emph render="italic">Monocle</emph>, a magazine of satire and social criticism that Navasky and several friends founded and published while they were at Yale Law School and for some time after. In addition to correspondence and other relevant material, there are articles about 
                        <emph render="italic">Monocle</emph> and a number of full issues.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="italic">Monocle </emph>struggled financially and, in an attempt to keep the magazine going, the group initiated a related enterprise – 
                        <emph render="italic">Monocle</emph> books (which they called Pentacle Books). Their plan was to come up with ideas for books that didn’t require authors; find trade-book publishers who were willing to pay for and publish them; hire researchers to do the work; and then use the profits to keep 
                        <emph render="italic">Monocle </emph>afloat and pay themselves. The book packaging effort produced more than thirty books. Many of these books are included in the series, along with background material. Among these, in Box 18, Folder 23, is their single bestseller – 
                        <emph render="italic">Report from Iron Mountain: On the Possibility and Desirability of Peace</emph>. Published in 1967 by Dial Press, it purported to be the suppressed work of a small government group whose outrageous conclusions were presented in bureaucratic prose with lots of actual footnotes. It was such a successful satirical spoof that some groups, particularly conspiracy theorists, continue to reject the numerous admissions and explanations of its authors and contend that it is the work of an actual secret government panel. In his book, 
                        <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion</emph>, Navasky provides the full story of what the 
                        <emph render="italic">Guinness Book of World Records</emph> calls the “Most Successful Literary Hoax.”</p>

                    <p>Published in 1980, Victor Navasky’s second book,
                        <emph render="italic">Naming Names</emph>, is an investigation of the blacklist period in Hollywood. The topic had interested Navasky for some time and, while writing 
                        <emph render="italic">Kennedy Justice</emph>, he began to focus this interest on the role of the informer. An article in 1970 for the 
                        <emph render="italic">New York Times Magazine</emph> – “To Name or Not To Name" - was followed by a contract for 
                        <emph render="italic">Naming Names</emph>. Although not working on the book exclusively, Navasky spent much of the next decade doing research and writing. He interviewed more than 150 actors, writers, directors, and producers, as well as lawyers and agents, conducting detailed research on events and individuals as he sought to capture the context and pressures of the period as experienced by those who lived through it. The book was well reviewed and won a National Book Award in 1982 when the paperback edition was published. This series, the largest in the collection, contains a great deal of research material; intermediate writing products – notes, drafts and proofs; and various related items dated after the book’s publication, such as reviews and correspondence.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains research material of various types including correspondence; articles (many annotated by Navasky); court documents; bibliographic note cards, topical research (e.g., censorship, anti-Communism, Smith Act); and interviews or parts of interviews in various formats. (Note that in Series X: Audio-Visual Materials, researchers may access a number of recorded interviews with individuals such as Albert Maltz, Fred Donner, Estelle Foreman, and Leo Townsend.)</p>
                        <p>Of those affected by the blacklist, the most extensively represented in the subseries are Elia Kazan, Arthur Miller, Albert Maltz, and Tony Kraber, although there is a wealth of material on numerous others. Copies of HUAC testimony are available for a number of those who were called to appear before the Committee.</p>
                        <p>Of particular note is a series of questionnaires whose respondents include Ring Lardner Jr., Will Geer, Elia Kazan, John Houseman, Lester Cole, and many others. These documents were made available by Robert Vaughn, the American actor best known for his television role in the 1960s series 
                            <emph render="italic">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</emph> and his Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor (1960) in 
                            <emph render="italic">The Young Philadelphians</emph>. Vaughn had continued his education during his acting career, earning a PhD from the University of Southern California in 1970. His dissertation, which he published as a book in 1972 (
                            <emph render="italic">Only Victims: A Study of Show Business Blacklisting</emph>) was based on original research, primarily questionnaires and interviews. Duplicates of the questionnaire responses were given to Victor Navasky in 1975.</p>
                        <p>In addition to actual research, this subseries contains materials created in support of the research. Examples include his address book at the time, calendar pages, correspondence, expense sheets, and documentation of a trip he made to California in June of 1976.</p>

                    <p>What was initially proposed as a long essay, a third person meditation on the role of opinion journalism, became, instead, a first person series of what Victor Navasky calls “misadventure stories.” 
                        <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion</emph> is part history, part memoir, part organizational biography, and a paean to journals of opinion. Winner of the 2005 George Polk Book Award, Navasky describes the book's evolution in a 2004 speech (see Box 46, Folder 21).</p>
                    <p>This series includes a significant amount of research material. Contained in two subseries, the research covers a wide variety of topics and individuals. There are also products of the writing process, such as drafted material and a typescript, as well as exchanges with various individuals who were editing and fact checking. Post publication and publicity materials are also included.</p>

                        <p>This subseries consists of a group of file folders (more than five linear feet), with original numbers and titles, containing material on the topic of opinion journalism, presumably research for
                            <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion</emph>. There are folders for 
                            <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph> and for many other journals of opinion. In addition, the material covers such topics as objectivity, ideology, bias, censorship, ethics, and the publishing business in general. In the folders labeled "Individuals" may be found research on journalists, pundits, editors, publishers and writers of all kinds. There are a number of folders containing untitled notebooks.</p>
                        <p>Not all of the sequential numbers appear in the list of folders (4,16,17,and 20 are skipped). It is possible that these had been removed or, perhaps, the material was re-labeled and used in some other context.</p>

                            <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion</emph>. It consists of articles, correspondence, interviews, publications, and court documents. The philosopher Jurgen Habermas and his views on the role of opinion journals make an appearance in this subseries. Not only did Navasky collect material about Habermas, he also corresponded with, visited and interviewed him for the book. Considerable material on Alger Hiss appears in the subseries and may be seen in multiple chapters within the book, most extensively in Navasky's discussion of his clash with Allen Weinstein over Weinstein's 1978 book,
                            <emph render="italic">Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case</emph>.</p>

Note that many of the original folder titles refer to "Book 4" which appears to have been the working title for

                        <p>The writing process subseries contains drafts, edits, reviewer comments, notes, and many illustrations, some in color. Within the folders of illustrations, there are numerous duplicates. There are also illustrations that did not appear in the final book. Of interest are the many changes Navasky made to the structure of the book during the writing process. It should be noted that some of the drafts are incomplete. (The working manuscripts reflect the use of Microsoft Word's change tracking feature.)</p>

                        <p>In 1976, Victor Navasky donated the bulk of his papers associated with the book, 
                            <emph render="italic">Kennedy Justice</emph>, to the John F. Kennedy Library. A copy of the deed of gift and an initial list of folder titles are included in this subseries. There also remain in this collection one complete draft with editors’ annotations (1971), a set of proofs, several folders of research material, sections of the book that were printed in the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Post</emph>, and numerous reviews.</p>
                        <p>The subseries also includes material associated with two books Navasky co-authored with Christopher Cerf – 
                            <emph render="italic">The Experts Speak, The Definitive Compendium of Authoritative Misinformation</emph> and 
                            <emph render="italic">Mission Accomplished! Or How We Won the War in Iraq: The Experts Speak</emph>. Each book contains a compilation of quotes by “experts” who turned out to be completely wrong. In addition to contracts, reviews, notes, and other related materials, there are several annotated drafts of the Iraq edition.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains articles, essays, book reviews, letters to the editor, and similar writings by Victor Navasky, a representative sample of Navasky's output but, by no means, all of it. Research material, correspondence, drafts, notes, and other associated items are included with some of the articles. There are pieces from as early as 1958. Among the publications represented are the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Times Magazine</emph>,

                            <emph render="italic">The Plain Dealer</emph>, and 
                            <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph>. Many of Navasky's "In Cold Print" columns from the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Times Book Review </emph>are included. Articles written by Navasky also appear in other series, as appropriate.</p>
                        <p>A Navasky article -- "Ronald Reagan and the Supremes" -- appeared in 
                            <emph render="italic">Esquire</emph> magazine's April 1987 issue. In addition to a copy of the piece, this subseries contains a great deal of associated research material, covering not only judicial appointments but many other aspects of Reagan's time in office.</p>

                        <p>The amount of material associated with Navasky's Alger Hiss-related articles warrants its own subseries, although much of it is focused on a single piece - "The Case not Proved Against Alger Hiss." The article is a critique of Allen Weinstein’s 1978 book, 
                            <emph render="italic">Perjury: the Hiss-Chambers Case</emph>. Navasky conducted extensive research and interviews in preparation for the article, which appeared in the April 8, 1978, issue of 
                            <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph>. Not only does this subseries contain material associated with the article's research and writing, it also includes relevant items subsequent to its publication. An example involves Sam Kreiger, one of the individuals interviewed by both Weinstein and Navasky, who brought a libel suit against Weinstein in 1979. There are documents from 
                            <emph render="italic">Krieger, Sam v. Allen Weinstein et al.</emph> which include Weinstein’s deposition and a transcript of Weinstein’s interview of Kreiger.</p>
                        <p>Navasky continued his criticism of Weinstein’s work in a 1982 essay “Weinstein, Hiss, and the Transformation of Historical Ambiguity into Cold War Verity,” which is included in a 1982 book edited by Athan G. Theoharis titled 
                            <emph render="italic">Beyond the Hiss Case: The FBI, Congress, and the Cold War</emph>. Correspondence, notes, research materials and working drafts are included.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains Navasky materials relating to Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, where he directs the George Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism. Highlights include a series of lectures by editors, writers, art directors, and publishers from magazines such as 
                            <emph render="italic">Vanity Fair</emph>, 
                            <emph render="italic">The New Yorker</emph>, and 
                            <emph render="italic">Harper's</emph>. The lectures, delivered as part of the George Delacorte Lecture Series, became chapters in 
                            <emph render="italic">The Art of Making Magazines</emph>, edited by Navasky and Evan Cornog (Dean of the School of Communication at Hofstra University and former publisher of the 
                            <emph render="italic">Columbia Journalism Review</emph>).</p>
                        <p>There are also materials associated with Navasky's Magazine Workshop in which students create and publish a complete magazine from scratch. Titled 
                            <emph render="italic">The New York Review of Magazines</emph>, it is a magazine about magazines. Workshop materials and full issues are contained in this subseries.</p>
                        <p>Of particular interest, in Box 75, Folder 31, are items involving Victor Navasky's 2006 appearance on Bill O'Reilly's television show - 
                            <emph render="italic">The Factor</emph>. O'Reilly contends that there is a liberal bias in the hiring of teachers at the Columbia University School of Journalism. Navasky denies the existence of bias. The folder contains materials used in preparation for the appearance and, also, threatening email recieved by Navasky.</p>

                    <p>This series contains material on a wide range of topics of interest to Victor Navasky. Some of the individuals, events, and issues might appropriately be arranged with a previous series, or with more than one. An example is the U.S. Postal Service. Navasky’s initial postal concerns began during his 
                        <emph render="italic">Monocle </emph>days; his involvement in postal service issues continued and was detailed in 
                        <emph render="italic">A Matter of Opinion</emph>. Similarly overlapping topics are included in "Subject Files" along with many that are clearly stand-alone in nature.</p>
                    <p>The series also includes material from several legal cases. 
                        <emph render="italic">Navasky, Victor S. v. Central Intelligence Agency</emph> involved an attempt by Navasky to obtain all documents relating to clandestine book publishing activities of the CIA; he was unsuccessful. 
                        <emph render="italic">Rancho La Costa v. Penthouse</emph> was a libel action brought by the owners of the La Costa resort against 
                        <emph render="italic">Penthouse</emph> magazine. Victor Navasky served as an expert witness.</p>
                    <p>During 1994, Navasky took a sabbatical from 
                        <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph> for research and initial work on a book about opinion journalism, planning to spend six months as a visiting fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School and the next six months at Columbia University’s Freedom Forum Media Studies Center. His plans changed somewhat as it was in 1994 that he unexpectedly agreed to become owner and publisher of 
                        <emph render="italic">The Nation</emph>. Within this series are materials from his somewhat modified Harvard experience and also from the Freedom Forum.</p>
                    <p>Other series highlights are the FBI files of I.F. Stone; materials for a class Navasky taught at New York University in the Spring and Fall of 1973; correspondence with Christopher Hitchens, Kathy Boudin, John Kennedy, Jr.; FOIA documents and other items relating to Stanley Levison; and an assortment of materials associated with the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, a number of folders address the Rosenberg Case.</p>
                    <p>In the folder labeled, “Trillin, Calvin,” (Box 88, Folder 7) there is correspondence with Lavinia B. Rosenzweig, a member of the Newnan Reading Circle in Newnan, Georgia. Navasky agreed to respond to a questionnaire ostensibly about Calvin Trillin, which was to be used in writing a paper for the group’s study of “Humorists and their Humor.” The letters are very entertaining and reveal more about the wit of Victor Navasky (and Ms. Rosenzweig) than about Calvin Trillin. A photograph of Navasky and Trillin is also included.</p>
