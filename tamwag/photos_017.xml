            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Local 1930, New York Public Library Guild, was chartered by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) in 1968. Members of Local 1930 are employed by the New York Public Library, by the City of New York in its branch libraries, and the libraries of mayoral departments and agencies. The bargaining unit includes professional, non-professional and technical positions. In response to the New York City fiscal crisis of 1975, library support groups made up of library staff and the community at large organized to lobby against an employment freeze, curtailment of services, reduction in weekly hours, branch closings and job terminations. This small collection of 28 (mostly black and white) photographs and four graphics covers the years 1968-1978 and documents some of this resistance; it also includes shots of membership meetings and demonstrations, most of which were used in Local 1930’s newsletter.</abstract>

            <p>AFSCME Local 1930, better known as the New York Public Library Guild, was chartered by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) in 1968. Members of Local 1930 are employed by the City of New York in the Branch libraries and the libraries of mayoral departments and agencies and by the New York Public Library. The bargaining unit includes professional, non-professional and technical titles.</p>
            <p>In response to the New York City fiscal crisis of 1975, library support groups made up of library staff and the community at large organized to lobby against an employment freeze, curtailment of services, reduction in weekly hours, branch closings and job terminations. In 1978, unions representing city employees negotiated the Coalition Economic Agreement with the City of New York, relating to cost of living adjustment payments. When the New York Public Library refused to comply with the terms of the agreement, contract negotiations came to a standstill and Local 1930 members staged a demonstration before the issue was resolved.</p>
