            <p>Frances Hovey Stoddard was born in Middlebury, Vermont, on April 25, 1847. He graduated with an A.B. with high honors from Amherst College in 1869 and subsequently began teaching. He married Lucy Maria in Springfield, Massachusetts on May 14, 1873, and they had a daughter, Lucy Stoddard. After 1873 Stoddard worked for several years in the cotton manufacturing business in Northampton, Massachusetts. He was a student at Oxford University from 1884-1886 and afterward spent two years at the University of California as an instructor of English literature. In 1888 Stoddard became Professor of English Language and Literature at New York University; he held that title until he retired in 1914 as Professor Emeritus. It was during his first year at NYU that the University began admitting graduate students as candidates for the doctoral degree. He also served as the Dean of the Faculty of the College of Arts and Pure Science (subsequently the College of Arts and Science) from 1910-1914.</p>
