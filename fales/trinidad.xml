            <p>David Trinidad was born in Los Angeles in 1953 and raised in the San Fernando Valley. He received his B.A. in English from 
                <corpname>California State University, Northridge</corpname>, where he studied poetry. From 1981 to 1984, he was the editor and publisher of Sherwood Press, established in memory of the poet Rachel Sherwood, which published titles by such poets as Dennis Cooper, Amy Gerstler, Tim Dlugos, and Alice Notley. Trinidad's first book of poems, 'Pavane,' was published in 1981. It was followed by 'Monday, Monday' in 1985, 'Living Doll' in 1986, and November, published by 
                <corpname>Hanuman Books</corpname> in 1987. In the early eighties, he was associated with the writers who frequented 
                <corpname>Beyond Baroque</corpname> Literary/Arts Center in Venice, California. This group included Dennis Cooper, Amy Gerstler, Benjamin Weissman, Jack Skelley, and Bob Flanagan. In 1988, Trinidad moved to New York City. That year another Hanuman Book, 'Three Stories,' was published. He received an M.F.A. in Poetry from 
                <corpname>Brooklyn College</corpname> two years later. While at Brooklyn College, he studied with Allen Ginsberg and Joan Larkin. A Taste of Honey, Trinidad's collaboration with Bob Flanagan, appeared in 1990. It was followed by Hand Over Heart: Poems 1981-1988 (Amethyst Press, 1991) and Answer Song (High Risk Books, 1994). In 1996, he edited Powerless, the selected poems of Tim Dlugos. His most recent collection, 'Plasticville,' was published by Turtle Point Press in 2000. Trinidad has received grants from The Fund for Poetry and the 
                <corpname>New York Foundation for the Arts</corpname>. He continues to live in New York City. He currently teaches poetry at Rutgers University, where he directs the Writers at Rutgers series, and is a member of the core faculty in the M.F.A. writing program at 
                <corpname>The New School</corpname>. He has also taught at

            <p>The David Trinidad Papers is a part of the Downtown Collection at the Fales Library, New York University. The Fales Library is the primary special collections division of the NYU libraries, housing nearly 200,000 volumes of English and American literature from 1700 to the present. Strengths of the collection include the development of the English and American novel, with an emphasis on the Gothic and the Victorian novel. The Downtown Collection, of which the Trinidad Papers is a part, is a comprehensive collection of printed materials, archives, and other materials related to the Downtown New York scene from ca. 1975 to the present.</p>
            <p>The David Trinidad Papers is comprised of the correspondence and manuscripts of many notable literary and cultural figures, scrapbooks, manuscripts, collaborative projects, journals, journalism, reviews, business/production files for each book project, posters and videocassettes. The archive contains an almost comprehensive collection of the early to present-day literary career of David Trinidad. Trinidad's original organization of his papers was preserved as much as possible.</p>
