    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Stereoscopy is a photographic technique that involves taking double photographs from slightly different perspectives that when viewed through a stereoscope (a viewer designed to view the photographs side-by-side, around 2.5 inches apart, as the human eye would see it) creates the illusion of depth, thus tricking the brain into seeing one image that appears to have three dimensionality. Stereographs are double photographic prints that are mounted on sturdy cards to be placed into a stereoscope for viewing. Although early stereoscopy dates back to the 1830s, it did not become popular until the 1850s when a simpler and more accessible stereoscopic viewer was invented by Scottish scientist, David Brewer.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
