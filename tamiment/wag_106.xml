            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Maurice Forge (1902-1990) was a New York bus driver who became an organizer, news editor, and ultimately a vice president of the Transport Workers Union (TWU). In the late 1930s, Forge began organizing the TWU’s Airline Transport Division (ATD). A decade later, a union-wide effort to sever TWU ties with the Communist Party resulted in Forge’s expulsion from the TWU. The Maurice Forge Papers include materials from Forge’s TWU career, including union publicity materials, official correspondence, and transcripts of Forge’s TWU hearing and of the government deportation hearing of TWU official John Santo.</abstract>

            <p>Maurice Forge was born on October 6, 1902 in New York City. After losing his job as a commercial artist in 1930, Forge became a bus driver. Working at night, Forge began organizing by day for the fledgling Transport Workers Union (TWU). His union involvement deepened when he became editor of the 
                <title render="italic">TWU Bulletin</title>. Forge, a Communist Party member, was hired as a full-time paid union organizer, and became the leading force behind the TWU's Publicity Department. In the late 1930s, Forge became a TWU vice-president and director of the union's new Air Transport Division (ATD). Airline organizing brought him into conflict with other CIO unions, as well as with powerful elements within the TWU who questioned the wisdom of investing union resources in this new venture. Despite some successes, Forge was discouraged about the lack of adequate support from the TWU establishment, leading him to champion the formation of a Committee for Air Transport Autonomy (CATA) after TWU's Biennial Convention in 1948. In the late 1940s, TWU president Michael Quill broke with the Communist Party, and union officials set about severing TWU's ties to the Party. Forge was tried before a union committee and, along with other influential TWU members, expelled from the union.</p>
            <p>Forge went back to bus driving on Long Island, and continued to participate, unofficially, in the activities of TWU Local 252. Eventually he bought and ran the Crestwood Bus Company (he sold the company in 1970). Over the years, Forge maintained contact with many former colleagues from the ATD and from TWU Locals 100 and 252. He also remained close to Michael Quill, and, after many years lobbying to regain his TWU membership, Forge was granted reinstatement in 1984.</p>
            <p>Forge died in Freeport, Long Island in February 1990.</p>

            <p>Series I, General Files.</p>
            <p>Series I includes Forge's personal and official correspondence, TWU Executive Board minutes, trial transcripts, leaflets and ATD reports. Documents reflect Forge's activity in the TWU, especially from the late 1940s, when he came into conflict with TWU officials. Also in this series are materials reflecting Forge's involvement in the creation and development of the ATD and CATA. Correspondence includes letters to his wife, Bess, letters from TWU president Michael Quill and former TWU official John Santo after Santo's deportation to Hungary for being a non-citizen Communist Party activist; and letters with Charles Smolikoff, Armand Scala, and Fred Swick of the TWU about the progress of forming the ATD. Also included is a 1947 transcript of Santo's Department of Immigration trial, as well as a transcript of 1950 proceedings against Forge by the TWU.</p>
            <p>Series II, Clippings, Credentials, Flyers, Pamphlets</p>
            <p>Series II includes clippings on TWU leaders and labor issues; flyers publicizing union activities; and pamphlets by and about the TWU and the ATD. Other materials include publicity by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) directed at TWU members and other government anti-Communist publications; a pamphlet, " 
                <title>How the Milwaukee Sentinel Exposed Milwaukee Communists</title>"; and a HUAC publication of John Santo's trial transcript. Also in this series are photocopied clippings of editorials written by Forge in the 1970s and 1980s; and a file of Forge's credentials and identification cards.</p>
