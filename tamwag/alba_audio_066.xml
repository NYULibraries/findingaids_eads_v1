      <p>The Arthur H. Landis Oral History Collection was donated to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade
        Archives by Arthur H. Landis in the early 1980s. The collection came to New York University
        in January 2001 as part of the original acquisition of Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives
        collections, formerly housed at Brandeis University. The audiotapes in the Arthur H. Landis
        Collection were separated from the Arthur H. Landis Papers at the time of processing.</p>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Arthur H. Landis (1917-1986) went to Spain in 1937 to join the 15th International Brigade;
        he served with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion, as an American volunteer in what became a
        predominantly Canadian unit. In 1967, Landis wrote <emph render="italic">The Abraham Lincoln
          Brigade</emph>, a general history of American volunteers in the Spanish Civil War, and
        later published <emph render="italic">Spain! The Unfinished Revolution</emph>, about the
        political complexities of the war. </p>
      <p>The Arthur H. Landis Oral History Collection is comprised primarily of approximately 100
        hours of audio-taped recordings of American veterans of the Spanish Civil War. The original
        1/4" tapes were created between 1963 and 1965 as part of the research for Landis's <emph
          render="italic">The Abraham Lincoln Brigade</emph>. Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln
        Brigade (VALB) associates around the country, alone and in small groups, recorded their
        memories of battles and day-to-day activities in which they had participated.</p>
      <p>The idea of audio-taping veterans first occurred to Landis in April of 1963, and by August
        1964 the project was gathering steam. On August 10th Landis sent a letter to VALB associate
        Donald Thayer in San Francisco detailing the information that he was seeking from SCW
        veterans. Thayer excerpted Landis's letter in a general mailing to VALB members, requesting
        that they make their own audiotapes, in which they were to supply detailed information about
        their battalions, units, firepower, orders received, positions occupied, nature of attacks,
        terrain conditions, day-to-day positions, casualties and prisoners, wins and losses,
        "human-interest vignettes," promotions or substitutions, and related information. Landis
        emphasized that he still badly needed information on Aragon, Teruel, the Retreats, and the
        Ebro. A decade after the research was completed, Landis recalled that the tapes contained
        the "detailed examination of American brigade and battalion involvement in a particular
        battle or series of battles in a particular campaign, and/or the structure, personnel and
        participation in action of a unit such as transport, artillery, the American Medical Bureau,
        etc." At least 20 of the tapings were not personally attended by Landis, but were produced
        according to his explicit instructions. Veterans Steve Nelson and Donald Thayer conducted a
        handful of the interviews. After Landis completed a draft of the book, veterans in VALB's
        New York office met and recorded their suggestions for changes (tapes ALBA A 66-2 and ALBA A
        66-36).</p>
      <p>Landis's research project stimulated intense interest among VALB members. Donald Thayer
        reported that when he played a tape made for Landis by a veteran for a group of VALB
        members, it stirred in the vets "all of the memories of the Brigade years."</p>
      <p>Responding to a comment in 1977 by veteran Randall "Pete" Smith that Landis had downplayed
        the involvement of a fellow SCW veteran in his book, Landis recounted in a detailed letter
        the way in which veterans had been notified about the project, charging the New York VALB
        office with neglecting to invite the participation of a number of vets.</p>
      <p>In the late sixties, Landis tried to interest the VALB leadership in funding a project to
        preserve the audiotapes, and later proposed a project that went beyond preservation. He
        explained his reasons for wanting to embark on this project in a 1974 letter to Brandeis
        University Special Collections Librarian Victor Berch, arguing that "new tapes [should] be
        made--and quickly, before the rest of us die off." Landis further proposed to "edit and
        re-tape" the tapes he had of vets who had already died. This project does not appear to have
        been carried out. But in the 1980s the reel-to-reel tapes were copied to audiocassettes.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>For the audiotape project Landis provided veterans with a demo tape (ALBA A 66-038) that
        "gave the outline structure of the book and a detailed explanation of his desire to give
        adequate attention to all phases of the war which Americans participated in, from ambulance
        drivers to the commando zealots." Further, Landis stressed: "material for taping [should] be
        put in chronological order to avoid a time-consuming play-back," that veterans "make notes
        before making the tape," and "tape at a speed of 3-1/4." Members were told that they could
        use their own tape recorders, or that VALB would loan out both a recorder and tapes.</p>
      <p>The tapes were not professionally recorded, nor were the sessions conducted as conventional
        oral histories. Consequently, the sound quality varies from tape to tape, and veterans at
        times do not identify themselves or provide many autobiographical details. The focus is on
        their day-by-day participation in the Spanuish Civil War.</p>
      <p>Series I: Reel-to-Reel Tapes. Book Project, 1963-1965, contains individual and group
        interviews conducted in the course of research for Arthur Landis's book, <emph
          render="italic">The Abraham Lincoln Brigade </emph>, and one demo tape produced by
        Landis.</p>
      <p>Series II: Miscellaneous Reel-to-Reel Tapes, 1945-1970, consists mostly of interviews with
        Spanish Civil War veterans, some commenting on Landis's published work, and music tapes,
        several of which feature singer (and veteran) Bart Van der Schelling singing songs of the
        Spanish Civil War. Van der Schelling is pictured with Paul Robeson and Arthur Landis, among
        others, in a photograph in the Arthur H. Landis Photo Collection.</p>
      <p>The availability of CD reference copies and audiocassettes copies in indicated in the
        entries for individual items. Reel-to-reel tapes labeled "not transferable" in the
        descriptions were damaged or posed other serious problems that prevented transferring them
        to CD.</p>

      <head>Arrangement</head>
      <p>Each tape has been assigned a unique item number (i.e., ALBA A 48-11), and the collection
        is arranged in item number order. In general, the tapes are arranged alphabetically by the
        first name mentioned in the caption.</p>
      <p>Entries in the reel-to-reel item lists indicate whether there is a CD reference copy and/or
        audiocassette copies. The reference CDs are numbered to correspond with the reel-to-reel
        numbers (followed by an "R") and are stored separately. Cassette copies are numbered ALBA A
        66-72 through ALBA A 66-160 and are arranged numerically and stored separately.</p>
      <p>The files are organized in 2 series:</p>
