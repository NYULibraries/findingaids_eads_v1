    <abstract id="aspace_11e6cb65241091e7d51c817d944238a0">The Pierrepont family papers (1761-1918) document the intersection of commercial, civic and personal interests across three generations of one of the most prominent and influential families of nineteenth century Brooklyn, New York. The bulk of the collection concerns the business dealings of Henry Evelyn Pierrepont from 1838 to his death in 1888. This especially includes an extensive set of accounting and transactional records concerning the Pierrepont Stores, the family's warehouse on Brooklyn's East River waterfront; these include records of ships arriving at the Stores and their cargoes delivered. Additionally, there are substantive correspondence, legal documents and other materials concerning the Union Ferry Company, of which Henry was an officer. In addition to commerce and shipping, a major theme of the collection is that of land acquisition in Brooklyn Heights and at the adjacent waterfront in the early nineteenth century, and the development of that property over the course of the century. Included in the collection are correspondence, deeds, indentures, leases, accounting records, diaries, maps, invoices, receipts, business proposals, legal filings, clippings, and historical and genealogical manuscripts.

<p><emph render="bold">Hezekiah Beers Pierpont:</emph></p><p>Hezekiah Beers Pierpont amassed a fortune through the operation of a farm and gin distillery, and through real estate investments in the Village and City of Brooklyn during the first three decades of the nineteenth century.  Born in New Haven, Connecticut on November 3, 1768, Hezekiah settled in New York City in 1790 where he worked as a clerk in the Customs House.  By 1793, Hezekiah had set out on his own ventures, forming the mercantile partnership Lefingwell and Pierpont.  The partnership dissolved in 1800 and Hezekiah moved to Brooklyn in 1801 after purchasing the brewery of Philip Livingston and converting it to a distillery for what became Anchor Gin.  The following year he married Anna Maria Constable, daughter of Anna White and William Constable of Philadelphia.  The couple came to have twelve children together, including Henry Evelyn Pierrepont.</p><p>During this period, Pierpont became known for his support of the development of the Village of Brooklyn.  He began to invest in local real estate in 1802, focusing his investments around present-day Brooklyn Heights, directly across the East River from lower Manhattan.  Pierpont supported the Fulton Ferry, which began the first steam ferry service between Brooklyn and Manhattan in 1814, making Brooklyn even more accessible to New York City.  At this same time, Pierpont acquired additional wealth through the inheritance and purchase of more than 150,000 acres of land in upstate New York from the estate of his father-in-law.</p><p>Hezekiah retired from active business in 1819 and closed the distillery, which was sold in 1824.  He committed much of his time to the improvement of both residential and business sections of Brooklyn Heights, proposing such developments as a promenade to be situated along the bluffs overlooking the East River and New York Harbor.  Hezekiah Beers Pierpont died in Brooklyn on August 11, 1838.</p><p>(Note on the Pierpont name: For a period of time the original spelling of the family name, Pierrepont, was superseded by the anglicized spelling Pierpont.  Hezekiah Beers Pierpont requested that his wife and children be known by the original spelling of Pierrepont around 1802, but did not himself adopt this spelling for business reasons.)</p><p><emph render="bold">Henry Evelyn Pierrepont:</emph></p><p>The second son of Hezekiah Beers and Anna Maria Constable Pierrepont, Henry Evelyn was born in Brooklyn on August 8, 1808. Henry Evelyn was educated in New York City and quickly acquired his father's prominence among Brooklyn's elite.  Upon the death of H.B. Pierpont, William Constable, the eldest Pierrepont son, took over the family's upstate properties while Henry Evelyn remained in Brooklyn, maintaining the family's influence on, and commitment to, the city's development. On December 1, 1841, Henry Evelyn married Anna Maria Jay, daughter of Peter Augustus Jay and Mary Rutherford Clarkson, and granddaughter of John Jay, governor of New York (1795-1801) and the first Chief Justice of the United States.  Together the couple had six children, including Henry Evelyn Pierrepont II and John Jay Pierrepont.</p><p>Henry Evelyn Pierrepont spent much of his life working to establish Brooklyn as a flourishing metropolis.  In 1844 a Brooklyn ferry lease was granted to Henry Evelyn Pierrepont and Jacob R. Leroy, who combined the five existing Brooklyn ferries into the Brooklyn Union Ferry Company.  The venture created a more frequent and regular service between Brooklyn and New York City, and effectively monopolized transportation across the East River prior to the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883.</p><p>By 1857 Henry Evelyn and William Pierrepont had established a joint venture, the Pierrepont Stores, "a United States bonded warehouse where ships' freight was received and stored for the owners, insured by the government, until duties were paid."   The Stores was a major port of entry for a number of different cargoes (primarily sugar and molasses) from locales ranging from the Caribbean to Manila.  Upon Henry Evelyn's retirement from business, his two sons took over the Pierrepont Stores, which they operated until leased to the Empire Warehouse Company in 1888, shortly after the death of their father on March 28, 1888.</p><p>Henry Evelyn Pierrepont dedicated much of his time to the cultural development of the city, as well as its commercial expansion.  He held a number of prominent positions, such as Trustee of Brooklyn Hospital, Trustee and President of Green-Wood Cemetery, Director of the Academy of Music, Director and President of the Brooklyn Club, and Director of The Long Island Historical Society.</p><p><emph render="bold">Henry Evelyn Pierrepont II:</emph></p><p>The eldest son of Henry Evelyn and Anna Maria Pierrepont, Henry Evelyn II was born in Brooklyn on December 9, 1845.  Henry Evelyn, Jr. studied at Columbia College, receiving his B.A. in 1867.  In 1869 he married Ellen A. Low, daughter of Ellen Almira Dow and Abiel Abbot Low, with whom he had six children.  He and his brother, John Jay, soon took charge of the Pierrepont Stores, joining forces with Ferdinand N. Massa in the firm of Pierrepont Brothers.  The brothers sold the Stores in 1888 and Henry Evelyn, Jr. retired from active business ventures, devoting his time to the further development of his real estate holdings.  He continued his commitment to work within the community, most notably at Grace Church, of which his father had been a founding member and senior warden, a position which Henry Evelyn, Jr. also came to hold.  Henry Evelyn Pierrepont II died in Brooklyn on November 4, 1911.</p><p><emph render="bold">John Jay Pierrepont:</emph></p><p>The younger of Henry Evelyn Pierrepont's two sons, John Jay was born in Brooklyn on September 3, 1849.  John Jay married, on April 26, 1876, Elise de Rham, the daughter of Charles de Rham and Laura Schmidt, and the couple had one child who died before reaching one year of age.  Elise Pierrepont died less than two years later on October 17, 1879 and John Jay Pierrepont lived out the rest of his life in the family house at One Pierrepont Place in Brooklyn, remaining an active member of Brooklyn society until his death on September 25, 1923.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The collection is comprised of several accessions. Explicit documentation of the provenance for most of these accessions is lacking.  Evidence exists that most of the material included in the collection was donated by Pierrepont family members who were active participants in The Long Island Historical Society (re-named Brooklyn Historical Society in 1985) from its founding in 1863.  The papers were received over a period of approximately seventy-five years, from the late nineteenth century through 1962. Copy of disputed will of H.B. Pierpont is the gift of Charlotte Beagle, 2015.</p>  </acqinfo>

<p>The collection was first described in 1978 by Thomas Mill. In 1999, with sponsorship from a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Committee, the finding aid was revised by Project Archivist Teresa Mora, with further edits by Project Consultant Marilyn H. Pettit. Additional minor edits were made by Leilani Dawson in 2006. In 2011, Project Archivist Larry Weimer slightly re-arranged parts of the collection and modified the finding aid, principally to accommodate input to a collection management system, Archivists' Toolkit. One additional file (1986.002) added to Series 3 by Archivist John Zarrillo in November 2014. Four additional court publications which had been separated from the papers were added to Series 6 by John Zarrillo in February 2015. Accession M1975.646 (broadside advertisement for land in Jefferson County) added to Series 3 by John Zarrillo in August 2015. Copy of the disputed will of H.B.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Pierrepont family papers illustrate the intersection of commercial, civic and personal interests across three generations of a Brooklyn family, principally in the nineteenth century. Although these papers span the period from 1761 to 1918, the bulk of the collection concerns the business dealings of Henry Evelyn Pierrepont from 1838 to his death in 1888. This especially includes an extensive set of records concerning the Pierrepont Stores, the family's warehouse on Brooklyn's East River waterfront. Included in the collection are correspondence, deeds, indentures, leases, accounting records, diaries, maps, invoices, receipts, business proposals, legal filings, clippings, and historical and genealogical manuscripts.</p><p>Included in the collection are a substantial number of deeds, leases, indentures, manuscript maps, title searches, and other documents concerning acquisition of land by the Pierreponts, primarily Hezekiah Beers Pierpont, in Brooklyn Heights and the adjoining waterfront. Similar documents concern the development of this land for personal use (e.g., the building of the family's home at One Pierrepont Place), civic improvement (e.g., the opening of streets, allocation of land to churches), and commercial ventures. Competing priorities among these interests can be seen in the collection, as in connection with attempts by cable car and elevated railway companies to build on or near Pierrepont property. </p><p>The Pierrepont's commercial activities are exceptionally well-represented in the collection. An extensive set of records for the Pierrepont Stores, from 1856-1888, includes day books, journals, ledgers, cash books, and records of deliveries received from arriving ships and goods transported to and from the Stores. In addition to the financial aspects of the business, the ledgers provide much information about the names of ships, their origin, and their cargo. Further, the Stores's time book is in the collection, with data on the names and daily hours of the workers. Correspondence, building construction and repair invoices, architectural plans, and business management documents concerning the Stores are in the collection. Henry's involvement as an officer of the Union Ferry Company, and the development of East River waterfront and ferry rights is well-represented in the collection with correspondence, proposals, maps, and legal documents. Account records related to Hezekiah's early nineteenth century distillery operation are in the collection.</p><p>A range of personal papers are in the collection. Many of these concern Henry and other Pierreponts engagement with civic institutions, such as the Long Island Historical Society, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Green-Wood Cemetery, and the Astronomical Society of Brooklyn. Henry's manuscript and supporting material for his published history of the Fulton Ferry is in the collection, along with other historical, biographical and genealogical materials. The collection includes a Civil War-themed scrapbook. Henry's rich diary from the last years (1877-1888) of his life is the collection. Correspondence between members of the Pierreponts, including Hezekiah's wife, Anna Maria, give insight into the Pierrepont's vision and concerns for the Montague Street area, for the Stores, and for their family welfare.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Brooklyn Historical Society holds many maps once owned by the Pierreponts. Many of these were likely separated over time from this collection and relate particularly to Series 3 (Real Estate) and Series 6 (Waterfront and Ferries). Generally, these are maps of Hezekiah Beers Pierpont's property in Brooklyn Heights and of the land extending into the East River granted to the Pierreponts by New York State. The maps are especially strong at showing street lines, property development and waterfront along what is now the Pierrepont Street and Montague Street area of Brooklyn Heights across most of the nineteenth century. Several maps are mid-nineteenth century re-surveys or drawings of earlier surveys, thereby emphasizing changes over time. The Pierrepont maps are foldered together in BHS's Map Collection and can be requested as a complete set. Alternatively, specific maps can be requested by call number; individual maps can be identified through BHS's on-line catalog, Bobcat, by searching "Pierrepont" in the "call number."</p><p>BHS also holds some maps concerning Hezekiah's holdings in upstate New York counties.

Much of the correspondence in the series concerns the various civic committees and religious or cultural institutions supported by the Pierreponts, including the Long Island Historical Society, Astronomical Society of Brooklyn, Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Committee on the University, and St. John's Church. Some correspondence and other documents concern the two Anna Maria Pierreponts (Constable and Jay); among these is an 1848 letter discussing the impact of a large fire in Brooklyn. </p><p>Also found here are materials concerning Henry's elementary education and intellectual interests, family history and genealogy, and material concerning deaths and burial monuments. Among the historical notes is 1863 correspondence from Henry Sr. to Henry Stiles discussing the history of Brooklyn Heights. Some financial records are included in the series, such as the details of a 1845 wharf and land purchase and Henry's personal cash book (1825-1832).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_3eb260623e40738927b1c5a272f2e148"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged by document form and subject matter in roughly chronological order.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref12_tqy" level="file"><did><unittitle>Henry E.

Included are an extensive number of legal documents, such as property conveyances, deeds, wills, indentures, mortgages, and leases. A bound volume of abstracts is in the series. A second set of abstracts are found in a volume originally used for recording bills receivable and payable of an unknown firm for 1788-1789; these bills include transactions with Gouverneur and Robert Morris, among others. There are real estate title searches dated after Hezekiah's death (1838-1854) and so were probably initiated by his son, Henry, as executor of the estate. Related documents include manuscript maps and correspondence. In addition to the Pierreponts, among the surnames appearing frequently in the legal documents are Benson, Brinckerhoff, DeBevoise, Jackson, Packer, Perry, Remsen, Tredwell, Van Wagenen, and Woortman.  </p><p>The series holds substantial documentation of the Pierrepont House at One Pierrepont Place, particularly invoices for construction labor and material. Documents in the series also refer to agreements concerning the opening (e.g., Remsen) and closing (Moser) of streets, a party wall, and land for the Church of the Pilgrims and other churches.</p><p>There are several manuscript maps of the Pierrepont distillery, Pierrepont property in Brooklyn, and the waterfront docks, including Whitehall slip in Manhattan. There is a large sketch of the Pierrepont Stores building.</p><p>The series also includes a deed for property in Redfield Township, Oswego County, NY, for Ellen I. Minor (daughter of Hezekiah B.

Organized by account, these three volumes detail the monthly balance of the Stores and the income earned in Storage as well as in Labor.  Also included are records of "Bills Payable," monthly totals of particular client's bills, and the cost of tools and furniture, as well as repairs, perquisites, and general expenses.  The ledgers indicate which accounts for which period are attributable to Ford and Co.

Especially interesting is that these volumes also list the origin of each ship.  The volumes are indexed by ship and entries list the client, ship, and cargo.  In addition, entries record port of origin, date of departure from that port, ports of call (much of this information is conveyed in symbols), duty charged, and receipt numbers, which do not appear to coincide with the receipt books of Sub-series 6.  Individual records occasionally include detailed notes of instruction regarding the care of the cargo.  Cancelled orders and ships returned in "distress" are also noted, as are transfers to other ships, which are recorded in red ink.</p><p>The "Cargo Received" Ledgers are especially notable in tracking increasingly diverse imports. The records show the growing demand for, and importance of, imports from colonial provinces in India and Asia, including Calcutta and Manila.  The most common cargoes appear to be sugar and molasses; other frequent items include hemp, shellac, and hides, as well as spices and textiles.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref151_qst" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cargo Received - Ford and Co.: 19 Feb 1858 - 29 Oct 1859</unittitle><unitdate normal="1858/1859" type="inclusive">1858-1859</unitdate><container id="aspace_2e7af6b021d95f025ffeef26828bb575" label="Text (14265000013907)" type="Box">24</container><container parent="aspace_2e7af6b021d95f025ffeef26828bb575" type="Item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref152_81o" level="file"><did><unittitle>[No label on binding]: 29 Oct 1859 - 28 Mar 1862</unittitle><unitdate normal="1859/1862" type="inclusive">1859-1862</unitdate><container id="aspace_220860ffae8159628532a27dd1b857fa" label="Text (14265000013915)" type="Box">25</container><container parent="aspace_220860ffae8159628532a27dd1b857fa" type="Item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref153_636" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cargoes Received No. 3 - Pierrepont Stores: 29 Mar 1862 -  4 Mar 1864</unittitle><unitdate normal="1862/1864" type="inclusive">1862-1864</unitdate><container id="aspace_87d7418edfa079d079a821b1ef92e8bd" label="Text (14265000013923)" type="Box">26</container><container parent="aspace_87d7418edfa079d079a821b1ef92e8bd" type="Item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref154_48l" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cargoes Received No. 4 - Pierrepont Stores: 15 Feb 1864 - 14 Aug 1866</unittitle><unitdate normal="1864/1866" type="inclusive">1864-1866</unitdate><container id="aspace_2c4b2ce8a5fca22f693ecc02542ff7a9" label="Text (14265000013931)" type="Box">27</container><container parent="aspace_2c4b2ce8a5fca22f693ecc02542ff7a9" type="Item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref155_ib5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cargo Received No. 5 - Pierrepont Stores: 14 Aug 1866 - 29 May 1869</unittitle><unitdate normal="1866/1869" type="inclusive">1866-1869</unitdate><container id="aspace_349766eed0a1787095be6461f367a858" label="Text (14265000013949)" type="Box">28</container><container parent="aspace_349766eed0a1787095be6461f367a858" type="Item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref156_0h2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cargo Book No. 6: 1 Jun 1869 - 5 Apr 1872</unittitle><unitdate normal="1869/1872" type="inclusive">1869-1872</unitdate><container id="aspace_3ce64479058354e0adcf4eb01a8c1641" label="Text" type="Box">29</container><container parent="aspace_3ce64479058354e0adcf4eb01a8c1641" type="Item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref157_g34" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cargoes Received - Pierrepont Stores: 5 Apr 1872 - 7 Sep 1874</unittitle><unitdate normal="1872/1874" type="inclusive">1872-1874</unitdate><container id="aspace_d29275b127b0a7e7507eca3a10662644" label="Text (14265000013964)" type="Box">30</container><container parent="aspace_d29275b127b0a7e7507eca3a10662644" type="Item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref158_2qi" level="file"><did><unittitle>[No label on binding]: 11 Sep 1874 - 14 Dec 1877</unittitle><unitdate normal="1874/1877" type="inclusive">1874-1877</unitdate><container id="aspace_3455b647ff964016780ccd9ca6c3e2c8" label="Text (14265000013972)" type="Box">31</container><container parent="aspace_3455b647ff964016780ccd9ca6c3e2c8" type="Item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref159_9nb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pierrepont Bros and Co.: 22 Dec 1877 - 17 Dec 1880</unittitle><unitdate normal="1877/1880" type="inclusive">1877-1880</unitdate><container id="aspace_ece45b235e573abb130fba78f87c6db4" label="Text (14265000013980)" type="Box">32</container><container parent="aspace_ece45b235e573abb130fba78f87c6db4" type="Item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref160_l01" level="file"><did><unittitle>[No label on binding]: 18 Dec 1880 - 21 Apr 1883</unittitle><unitdate normal="1880/1883" type="inclusive">1880-1883</unitdate><container id="aspace_3b263fe3cc1d21ad2974393da183e4ae" label="Text (14265000013998)" type="Box">33</container><container parent="aspace_3b263fe3cc1d21ad2974393da183e4ae" type="Item">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref161_7ku" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cargoes Received No. 12 - Pierrepont Stores: 20 Oct 1885 - 16 May 1888</unittitle><unitdate normal="1885/1888" type="inclusive">1885-1888</unitdate><container id="aspace_ec2e4cb82f38bdd9df7b366caba50dfe" label="Text (14265000014004)" type="Box">34</container><container parent="aspace_ec2e4cb82f38bdd9df7b366caba50dfe" type="Item">1</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref162_2lr" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Sub-series 6: Order Books</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">18.75 Linear Feet</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1856/1888" type="inclusive">1856-1888</unitdate></did><arrangement id="aspace_10147f6223b4cd3bf5f4ae21f3ddbd28"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The fifteen order books proceed chronologically by date of order.

The series includes correspondence, legal agreements, leases, corporate formation documents, and court filings. In addition to substantial manuscript material, there is printed material, such as New York Supreme Court decisions, government committee reports, leases, and pamphlets. Much of the material concerns negotiations with New York City and Brooklyn municipal authorities over franchise and property rights. Overall, strategic business objectives are a focus of the series, rather than day-to-day operational or financial matters. Nonetheless, there is material on specific matters, including the 1852 strike of ferry pilots and the 1883 experiment to replace gas lighting with electric on a ferry. The Fulton Ferry, South Ferry and Hamilton Avenue Ferry are well represented in the series, along with reference to Manhattan locations, such as the Wall Street Ferry. The Atlantic Dock Company and Williamsburgh Ferry Company are also represented. </p><p>The series also includes an incomplete handwritten manuscript of Henry E. Pierrepont's <emph render="italic">Historical Sketch of the Fulton Ferry and its Associated Ferries</emph>, along with correspondence, notes and other materials compiled in connection with the history. The series includes maps, sketches, correspondence, legal agreements, and other documents concerning the bulkhead, docks, piers, and other structures on Pierreponts's waterfront property (also see Series 3 for maps and other related material).</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref252_wfx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Union Ferry Company (5 folders)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1837/1890"

The numbering of the diaries, and an 1855 fragment, suggest that Pierrepont maintained a diary for many decades, but these are not in the collection and are not known to be extant. Each diary covers one calendar year and is numbered consecutively. The entries are handwritten and each diary begins with a one-page timeline of the year's major events.  </p><p>Daily entries typically include notes on the weather, Pierrepont's activities for the day, and other events of significance to Pierrepont. Though most are brief factual statements, Pierrepont expresses personal opinions about many matters. The daily entries are generally brief and concern the range of Pierrepont's interests: family, finances, commercial activities, civic activities, and politics. Personal notes include such matters as reflections on family deaths and lists of New Year's Day callers on Pierrepont and Pierrepont's calls on others. Pierrepont includes observations on local events, such as the blizzard of March 1888, and on some national events, such as his concern about communism in response to railroad labor strife in the summer of 1877. The diaries include descriptions of his travel, including at least one trip to Europe, in 1878. The series includes a separate log of his travels over four decades.</p><p>Miscellaneous documents found in the diaries remain in the series. Among these is an acknowledgement of payment signed by G. Stuart for portraits for William Constable (1797), a letter from Pierrepont to State Senator Kirnan requesting his support in defeating a bill (1884), and an almanac page with information about the Brooklyn Bridge (1884). </p><p>Also in the series are typescript transcriptions of extracts from diaries of Hezekiah Beers Pierpont and biographical notes.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref275_re9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Henry E: Diaries (14 folders)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1877/1888" type="inclusive">1877-1888</unitdate><container id="aspace_eb846ab2d8a3f32ea42f34dafe08fe48" label="Text (14265000013733)" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_eb846ab2d8a3f32ea42f34dafe08fe48" type="Folder">1-14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref276_fvb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Henry E: Diary Summary</unittitle><unitdate normal="1855/1855" type="inclusive">1855</unitdate><container id="aspace_52f63e3304496b0bf3d2d8a2d48d87eb" label="Text (14265000013733)" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_52f63e3304496b0bf3d2d8a2d48d87eb" type="Folder">15</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref277_qx6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Henry E: Travel Log</unittitle><unitdate normal="1843/1885" type="inclusive">1843-1885</unitdate><container id="aspace_80a263a5c6b4cdb3850df7eaf95dadf1" label="Text (14265000013733)" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_80a263a5c6b4cdb3850df7eaf95dadf1" type="Folder">16</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref278_39g" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hezekiah B: Diary Extracts and Historical Notes (2 folders)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1806/1820" type="inclusive">1806-1820</unitdate><container id="aspace_c4f449d1ba8c068c491b5514d1edfbc2" label="Text (14265000013733)" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_c4f449d1ba8c068c491b5514d1edfbc2" type="Folder">17, 18</container></did></c></c></dsc>
