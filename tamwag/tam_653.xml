The two organizations formally affiliated in 1973. This collection consists of serials and pamphlets collected by the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women. The subjects represented in the titles and content of the publications are socialism, feminism, lesbian and gay liberation, indigenous organizing, and prisoners' issues, among others. There are a limited number of international titles. The collection is an excellent source of information about the small presses of the revolutionary Left, as well as the history of the movements reflected in, and publishing, the newspapers and pamphlets.</abstract>

            <p>The collection consists of newspapers and pamphlets collected by the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women. The publications span the 1930s to the 2000s, with the bulk from the 1970s to the early 1980s. The collection includes over 300 titles, from primarily American publishers, with a small number of international titles. The serials often only include one or two issues from each title. This collection is particularly strong in the following subject areas: socialism, feminism, gay liberation, civil rights, indigenous organizing and prisoners’ issues. A small number of pamphlets address similar topics, with an additional focus on international issues, including Angola, Ireland and South Africa. The collection also includes subject files, which are comprised of newspapers and pamphlets that were arranged topically by the Freedom Socialist Party and Radical Women. The collection is an excellent source of information about the small presses of the revolutionary Left, as well as the history of the movements reflected in, and publishing, the newspapers and pamphlets.</p>

            <p>At the time of acquistion, most of the materials were arranged loosely by title. During processing, all materials were placed in archival boxes and folders and arranged into alphabetical order by title of the serial or pamphlet. A small grouping of subject files was present within the collection (mixed into the alphabetical run of titles). These folders containing subject files were separated and placed in Series III. Folder titles in Series III are original to the FSP/Radical Women, except those in square brackets, which have been supplied by the archivist.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The Freedom Socialist Party (FSP) was founded in Seattle, Washington in 1966 after a split in the U.S. Socialist Workers Party. Radical Women was created the following year by FSP founder Clara Fraser, her friend Gloria Martin, and activists from Students for a Democratic Society. Both organizations were established in the political contexts of international liberation struggles, the civil rights movement, and the Vietnam War. The political programs of these organizations, heavily influenced by Trotskyism, attempt to situate racial justice, women’s, and gay liberation movements within the Marxist framework. Therefore, the FSP and Radical Women look to these historically oppressed groups to provide revolutionary leadership. Radical Women provides trainings for women to assume leadership roles in social justice movements. Both organizations have been active in the anti-Vietnam war movement, union organizing, indigenous struggles and LGBTQ issues. The FSP and Radical Women formally affiliated in 1973.</p>
