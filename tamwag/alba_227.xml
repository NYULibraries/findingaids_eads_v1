      <abstract id="aspace_f0f47a77d1cdb1b7d48d5d6e4acbab96">Jacob Freeman (1918-1938) went to Spain
        in 1937 to fight with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. The ship taking
        him there was torpedoed, but Freeman remained unharmed. He went on to become an observer,
        map-maker and scout in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Freeman was wounded in the head by
        shrapnel in August 1938, and was killed in action in September 1938. The bulk of this
        collection consists of letters Freeman wrote from Spain to family members; as well as
        correspondence documenting the attempts of Freeman's father, Samuel, to obtain information
        about his missing son.</abstract>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Jacob Freeman (nicknamed Jack) was born in 1918 and grew up in New York City. His parents
        were active in left-wing politics; his father, Samuel, was Secretary-Treasurer of the
        Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paperhangers of America. Jacob Freeman left City
        College in February 1937. That May, he sailed for Europe to join the International Brigades
        in the Spanish Civil War.</p>
      <p>Freeman ran into trouble even before arriving in Spain when the ship transporting him from
        France, the City of Barcelona, was torpedoed and sunk by an Italian submarine. Freeman
        escaped unharmed. ("If they didn't get me with a torpedo they'll never get me," he wrote
        home.) He underwent training as an "observer," map-maker and scout; then, because of his
        age, he was for a time assigned to work as a translator at International Brigades
        headquarters rather than going into battle. However, he soon got his wish and was sent to
        the front lines. In the winter of 1937, Freeman contracted jaundice and pneumonia and was in
        and out of the hospital through the first few months of 1938. Back at the front, he was
        appointed group leader, overseeing a company of observers, and rose to the rank of sergeant
        during the Ebro campaign. In August 1938 Freeman was wounded in the head by shrapnel during
        an artillery bombardment. In September, he was killed in action at Sierra Cabals.</p>
      <p>Samuel Freeman, who had supported his son's commitment to the Republican cause, worked in
        New York to raise money for the Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (FALB) while Jacob
        was in Spain. After Jacob's letters abruptly stopped, Samuel tried assiduously for several
        months to obtain information about his son.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series I: Correspondence, 1937-1941</emph>. This series consists of
        approximately sixty letters sent from Spain by Jacob Freeman, mostly to his parents and
        brother. In the letters, Freeman provides detailed descriptions of life in training camp at
        Albaçete, and as an observer and scout on the front lines. In a letter to his brother
        Herbert, Freeman gives a moment-by-moment account of what happened on board the City of
        Barcelona when it was torpedoed by an Italian submarine. Several of Freeman's letters to his
        mother and aunt are written in Yiddish; in the collection, these letters are accompanied by
        translations done by Herbert Freeman in 1995 and 1997. Also included in this series are a
        letter from Spain from Saul Wellman to Samuel Freeman; letters between Samuel Freeman and
        the U.S. State Department when the elder Freeman was trying to find out what had happened to
        his son; a condolence letter after news came of Jacob's death; and a letter from Spanish
        Civil War veteran Alva Bessie to Samuel Freeman about having known Jacob in Spain.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series II: Subject Files, 1935-1939</emph>. This series includes two
        newspaper clippings about student activities from before Jacob Freeman went to Spain, and an
        article about Samuel having seen a photo of Jacob in Barcelona, wounded (a later letter from
        Jacob assures Samuel that he was mistaken in thinking the photograph was of his son). Other
        materials include an ophthalmology exam report and a handwritten note made by Jacob Freeman
        about a comrade owing him money, both from his time in Spain; International Brigades
        postcards annotated by Jacob Freeman; an issue of the Volunteer for Liberty, the
        International Brigades newspaper, with an article by Freeman on the responsibilities of an
        observer and scout in the military; and a Jack Freeman Memorial Roll Call membership issued
        by City College.</p>
