<p>Founded in 1982, the Radical Philosophy Association is an international organization whose members struggle against capitalism, racism, sexism, homophobia, disability discrimination, environmental ruin, and all other forms of domination, drawing upon a variety of radical traditions including phenomenology, Marxism, anarchism, post-structuralism, post-colonial theory and environmentalism. Its efforts center on conferences and publications. The RPA also publishes the journal <emph render="italic">Radical Philosophy Review</emph>.</p>  </bioghist>
