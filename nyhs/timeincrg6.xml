                    <head>Historical Note</head>
                    <p>The office of Editor-in-Chief did not exist at the formation of Time Inc. since the company initially had only 
                        <title render="italic">Time</title> as its major publication. Cofounders Henry R. Luce and Briton Hadden were both listed on the 
                        <title render="italic">Time</title> masthead as editors from 1923 through Hadden's death in 1929. Though both were listed, their agreement in practice was to swap positions as the heads of editorial and business.</p>
                    <p>After Hadden's death, John S. Martin became the managing editor of 
                        <title render="italic">Time</title> with Luce listed above him as editor. According to Robert T. Elson, writer of the authorized history of Time Inc., Luce was using the title of editor-in-chief in 1938 when he resigned as Time Inc.'s president and chief operating officer, but retained his roles as board chairman and editor-in-chief.</p>
                    <p>According to Time Inc.'s history on the company intranet, Luce restructured the management of the magazines in 1937, giving each a publisher, a managing editor, and an advertising director. This restructuring established the separation of the business side from the editorial side, respectively referred to as church and state by staff. Luce formalized these roles and the importance of separating them in a 1938 memo entitled "The Principles, Policies, Attitudes Etc. Which Govern and Motivate Time Inc." It is possible this restructuring is when Luce took on the title Editor-in-Chief although he isn't listed as such on magazine mastheads or in the annual reports until the 1940s. According to the intranet, Luce wrote a note to Hedley Donovan, his pick for next editor-in-chief, in 1962 reiterating the necessity of the independence of the office.</p>
                    <p>Editor-in-Chief was the top editorial position at Time Inc., overseeing editorial policies and standards for all titles and divisions including magazines, books and newspapers. The entire editorial side reported up to this position, and the editor-in-chief reported directly to the board. The publishing/business side reported up to top business executive which became the chief executive officer around 1960. In 1978, shortly before his retirement, Donovan presented a statement to the board to precisely define the role of editor-in-chief so that the office would be preserved for future holders. This statement was formally adopted as company policy in December 1978. In April 1986, succeeding Editor-in-Chief Henry Grunwald further updated the definition of the title in a statement to the board, a copy of which is in Ray Cave's files.</p>
                    <p>After the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1990 when the magazine and books divisions became subsidiaries, the editor-in-chief began reporting to the head of Time Warner blurring the editorial and publishing/business separation. In 2014 when Time Inc. disaffiliated from Time Warner, the editor-in-chief was replaced by the chief content officer reporting to the chief executive officer which removed the separation altogether.</p>

                        <p>Hedley Donovan was the second editor-in-chief of Time Inc. from 1964 to 1979, a position previously held only by the company's cofounder Henry R. Luce.</p>
                        <p>Donovan was a native of Minnesota and after graduating from the University of Minnesota, he spent three years at Oxford University studying history on a Rhodes scholarship. Instead of accepting a Harvard teaching assistant position, after graduation Donovan took the better paying job as a reporter at the Washington 
                            <title render="italic">Post</title> working on general and political assignments. During World War II, he served in Naval Intelligence.</p>
                        <p>
                            <title render="italic">Fortune</title> hired Donovan as a writer in 1945, promoting him to associate managing editor around 1950 and managing editor by 1953. In July 1959, Time Inc. announced Donovan's new position as editorial director, a deputy position to the editor-in-chief. While editorial director, Donovan established the Research and Development unit to conduct studies regarding Time Inc.'s ventures in television programming. In 1962, he was named to the board of directors. When Luce retired in April 1964, he recommended that the board appoint Donovan as his replacement.</p>
                        <p>During his tenure as editor-in-chief, Donovan made the decision to suspend publishing of 
                            <title render="italic">Life</title> in 1972 for financial reasons and launched the magazines 
                            <title render="italic">Money</title> (1972) and 
                            <title render="italic">People</title> (1974). Under his supervision, the Magazine Development Group also considered other new magazine ideas: 
                            <title render="italic">Well</title>, regarding health topics; 
                            <title render="italic">Camera Month</title>; 
                            <title render="italic">View</title>, the description of which sounds like a precursor to 
                            <title render="italic">People</title>; and a women's magazine. Though the women's magazine received a title (
                            <title render="italic">Woman</title>), and several years of work went into it, it was never realized. Time Inc. also acquired the Washington 
                            <title render="italic">Star</title> newspaper near the end of Donovan's tenure.</p>
                        <p>In 1978, shortly before his retirement, Donovan presented a statement to the board to precisely define the role of editor-in-chief so that the office would be preserved for future holders. As transcribed in Prendergast and Colvin's book 
                            <title render="italic">The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise, 1960-1980</title>, he stated: "[The editor-in-chief] is responsible solely to the board for editorial content." "The board... delegates to the editor-in-chief the continuing appraisal and direction of the company's editorial work." "The editor-in-chief is a member of the board and of its executive committee." "The board does not expect the editor-in-chief to maintain the same immediate authority over the editorial work of Books and the [Washington] 
                            <title render="italic">Star</title> as he does over the magazines. He will, however, appoint the managing editor of Books and the editor of the 
                            <title render="italic">Star</title>..."</p>
                        <p>His statement also defined the relationship of the editorial director as senior deputy to the editor-in-chief. This statement was formally adopted as company policy in December 1978.</p>
                        <p>While preparing for retirement, Donovan recommended his replacement be Henry Grunwald with Ralph Graves as the editorial director. Donovan retired as editor-in-chief in June 1979. 
                            <title render="italic">F.Y.I.</title>, the Time Inc. staff newsletter published a special issue of articles about Donovan on June 4, 1979.</p>
                        <p>After Donovan's retirement, he wanted to take some of his files in order to write his memoirs. Two sets of copies were made, one for the Archives and one for the researchers and writers working on the history of Time Inc. book. The original materials may be in the papers Donovan's family donated to the University Archives at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>
                        <p>Beginning in July 1979, Donovan served approximately one year as a White House senior advisor to President Jimmy Carter. In 1981, he was the visiting journalist at Harvard University, and in 1989 Donovan published his memoirs

                            <p>The Appointment Books document Donovan Hedley's schedule, professional and personal, and many of the years contain multiple books. As some are marked "T. Lanz," these are probably the books of his schedule kept by his executive secretary Gertrude "Trudi" Lanz. Some are marked with "Mrs. Donovan" indicating they are his wife Dorothy Donovan's schedule. Books similar in appearance to the marked books are tentatively attributed to her. A few of the books from 1973 were removed from a tax audit accordion folder that also contained expense reports.</p>

                            <p>Organized into four groups: two groups of folders designated by date ranges, one run of original alphabetical folders, and one run of duplicate alphabetical folders. The groups of folders designated by date range are in the same order as they were in the Time Inc. archives, and the group names are from labels on the shelf or drawer where they were housed. The arrangement for the alphabetical files is based on the original order which alphabetized by topic.</p>

                            <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                            <p>The Subject Files contain the majority of Donovan's correspondence and other office files and work product including remarks at board meetings; event invitations; press clippings; internal correspondence and memoranda; and correspondence from former and future United States presidents along with Congress members, heads of companies, presidents and directors at universities, and other notable people. The Subject Files folders are frequently labeled on the front cover in handwriting which looks like Donovan's. Some of the files contain cross-reference sheets indicating the Time Inc. Archives completed some work.</p>
                            <p>The files labeled as "1959-1979" and "1969-1978" are two groups of files that are labeled similarly to the alphabetical Subject Files and found together as folders and loose material. This might be material removed for research purposes, by Donovan or someone else, and not refiled into the original folders. Materials within each group have a loose topical relationship, and similar topics are in the alphabetically organized Subject Files. For "1959-1979" the majority of the materials were loose. The topics cover politics, United States presidents from Kennedy to Carter, and other politicians during this era. For "1969-1978" the majority of the materials were loose, and cover three topical areas: suspension of 
                                <title render="italic">Life</title>, research on the press, and speeches or talks.</p>
                            <p>The miscellaneous files within the alphabetical run contain primarily correspondence along with article proposals, request for issues of magazines, complaints about facts in articles, thank yous, and memos regarding staff, with extensive correspondence from several notable people including Malcom Forbes, Gaylord Freeman, Jr., George McGhee, Arthur "Red" Motley, Elmo Roper, Dean Rusk, John Volpe, and Thomas Watson, Jr. Some items of note in the miscellaneous files include a letter from the U.S. Embassy regarding Mrs. Gandhi (in "B-Miscellaneous"); letters from Buckminster Fuller describing "Spaceship Earth"; and a letter from Florida senator Billy Graham regarding <title render="italic">Time</title>'s Black Panther articles. Even when there is a specific file on a person or event, additional records may be in the respective miscellaneous file, such as with Herman Nickel, John Oakes, Carl Solberg, and Cyrus Vance.</p>
                            <p>In order to get background information on people or places and to stay apprised of current events and trends, Donovan utilized research assistants to write briefs on various topics. Briefs from 
                                <title render="italic">Time</title> reporter Dorothy "Dottie" Ferenbaugh are the most prevalent in Donovan's files. There are extensive research memos from Ferenbaugh in her own file as well as throughout the Subject Files on topics including: number of deaths of Black Panther party members due to encounters with the police; women's magazines; Time Inc. stockholders; summaries of 
                                <title render="italic">New York Times</title> articles; 
                                <title render="italic">Time</title>'s association with university curriculum; 
                                <title render="italic">Time</title>'s coverage of Guatemala; and the publishing industry.</p>
                            <p>Other items of interest include the compiled critiques on 
                                <title render="italic">Time</title> from throughout the United States and Canada found in "Attitudes", and the specifics on Donovan's business meetings in the "Lunches and Dinners" files which contain attendee and special guest lists, invitations, agenda, and correspondence.</p>
                            <p>The duplicate Subject Files may contain material not represented in the original alphabetical files although they include similar topics.</p>
