      <abstract id="aspace_109b4098300c2e09931120bdaf1fe906">Joseph Gordon (1914-1942) and Leo
        Gordon (1915-1938), brothers raised in Brooklyn, New York, joined the International Brigades
        in Spain in 1936 and 1937, respectively. Leo was killed in action. Joe later joined the
        Merchant Marines and was killed when his ship was torpedoed in the North Atlantic. The
        collection is primarily comprised of letters from Leo and Joe during their time in Spain, as
        well as letters written while they were traveling and working odd jobs around the U.S. in
        the early 1930s.</abstract>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Born Joseph and Leo Mendelowitz in 1914 and 1915, respectively, Joe and Leo Gordon were the
        sons of Eastern European immigrants, and were raised in the Williamsburg section of
        Brooklyn. In 1931, soon after their mother died, Joe left home to find work. He hopped
        freight trains and hitchhiked his way across the country, landing in San Francisco. Leo soon
        joined Joe out west. The brothers traveled together, working odd jobs in Arizona, New
        Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana. For a time, Joe had hopes of becoming a professional boxer in
        New Orleans. Eventually, Joe and Leo went to work for the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
        in Tennessee, Idaho, and Wyoming. It was during this period that the brothers became
        politically radicalized, and around this time they adopted the last name Gordon (Joe refers
        to it in a letter as their "red name"). Joe began to organize cannery workers in San Diego,
        quickly rising to a leadership role in the union. In 1935, he was beaten up by the San Diego
        Police and kicked out of the city.</p>
      <p>In December 1936 when he was 22, Joe Gordon sailed to France and hiked over the Pyrenees
        into Spain to join the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. He was soon on the
        front line in the Jarama Valley, where he made a name for himself as a tough and courageous
        fighter. A sniper shot to the forehead in February 1937 injured him in the eye, but after a
        short hospitalization Joe rejoined the Lincoln Battalion in the Brunete offensive. He was
        group leader in the infantry when he was wounded in his leg and sent back to the States to
        recuperate.</p>
      <p>Leo Gordon left for Spain in July or August of 1937, and joined the Canadian
        Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion. He quickly achieved the rank of lieutenant in command of a
        machine gun company. Leo fought at Fuentes de Ebro and the battle of Teruel, where he was
        wounded in the face by shrapnel fragments. In March 1938 he was leading a mission to enable
        the Republican retreat by thwarting the fascist advance when he was killed in action.</p>
      <p>Joe Gordon returned to Spain in June 1938, in part to search for his brother, who had thus
        far only been reported missing. Joe continued to fight with the International Brigades until
        they were evacuated from Spain. He returned to the States in December 1938.</p>
      <p>Back in New York, Gordon remained politically active as an organizer for the Communist
        Party, while making his living as a furrier. In 1942, he joined the Merchant Marines. His
        ship was torpedoed while delivering supplies to the Soviet Union on the Murmansk run, and
        Joe was killed.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series I, Spanish Civil War (1937-1939)</emph>primarily consists of
        letters from Leo and Joe Gordon to various family members about daily life, politics, and
        battle experiences. All of Joe's letters date from his second trip to Spain, after Leo's
        death. There are also newspaper articles related to the Spanish Civil War, a border pass and
        military passport (Carnet militar) for Joe.</p>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series II, Correspondence and Clipping (1931-1935)</emph>is almost
        entirely comprised of letters written to family by Joe and Leo during their travels around
        the United States in the early 1930s.</p>
      <p>Letters addressed to "Gus" are to Gussie Moskowitz, a cousin of the Gordons who worked in
        the garment industry and was involved in activist politics. In some letters Leo refers to
        Joe by his nickname, "Chosie."</p>
