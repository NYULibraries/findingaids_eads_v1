            <p>Collection was received with materials divided into distinct sets based on topic or type of material, with some materials loose and others in titled, alphabetized manila folders. Loose materials were rehoused in acid-free folders and boxes, and described by an archivist. Alphabetized and foldered photocopies of American loyalist petitions to the British government were kept in their original folders and in their original order.</p>
            <p>An accretion was received in June 2015 and described in October of 2015, and incorporated into the collection as the series "Academic Research and Writing" based on its content and the context of its creation. These materials were rehoused in acid-free folders and boxes when necessary while keeping the folders in their original order. Folder titles were transcribed directly from original folders when necessary. Oversized materials were removed from their original order and rehoused in bigger boxes and folders.</p>
