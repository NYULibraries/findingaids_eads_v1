            <p>The Gesellschaft Harmonie, later The Harmonie Club, was founded on October 16, 1852 by N. Gutman, M. Werner, H. Beer, H. Cohn, Chs. Werner, and Sigmund Werner to create a "mutually beneficial entertainment, occasional singing entertainments, lectures, etc" for recent German immigrants. The first meeting of the club was held November 8, 1852 in a rented room on Broome Street with thirty-nine members in attendence. Between 1852 and 1867, the burgeoning club was regularly moved as the membership outgrew each rented space. After this nomadic period the club purchased land at 45 West Forty-Second Street to erect a permanent location and raised enough funds to have architect Henry Fernbach design the building.</p>
            <p>The growth of the club was supported through dues and the creation of a nomination process to accept new members. To govern the organization, the club held monthly meetings run by elected officers. During the first ten years of existence the group held balls, lectures, and other social events throughout New York City. The tenth anniversary was celebrated on October 18, 1863 with a banquet and ball attended by over one hundred and fifty members. Two years later the club was incorporated as, "The Harmonie Social Club of the City of New York" with two re-incorporations in 1867 and 1894. The first re-incorporation altered the provisions to allow the club to own property and the building on Forty-Second Street. The latter reincorporation was to change the name to "The Harmonie Club." The members continued to use the former name, Gesellschaft Harmonie, until the use of German as the official language was changed to English in 1893.</p>
            <p>The large building erected on West Forty-Second allowed the Harmonie Club to host inhouse events, and for the next forty years the club regularly scheduled events such as dances, lectures, concerts, theatrical performances, billiards, cards, and bowling. In 1891, the Admission Committee was created, removing the task of approving and voting on new members from the general monthly meetings. The turn of the century brought several changes to the club. These changes included the first events for non-married members, declining interest in large social gatherings such as dances, and increasing property taxes along Forty-Second Street. In response to these pressures, the decision was made to relocate to a more suitable building. The club solicited donations from its members to build a new Harmonie Club House at Four East Sixtieth Street. The building was officially opened in December 1905 at a banquet attended by over four hundred members.</p>
            <p>To meet the changing interests of its members, the Harmonie Club purchased the North Shore Country Club on Long Island in 1914. According to an April 1914 President's Report: "The trend of time is toward the country club and healthy outdoor activity. With the increasing tendency to spread the weekends in suburban surrounding, with the increased use of the automobile, and with the increased desire for outdoor exercise, especially on the part of the younger generation." After several years of renovation the country club opened for Harmonie Club members only. This arrangement was designed to both serve and increase interest in the parent organization. Over the years, the North Shore Country Club has hosted several tournaments and still operates today as a private course.</p>
            <p>The growth of the Harmonie Club was slowed by the outbreak of World War I. This was because of the club's German affiliation and the wartime service of current and potential members. The Club supported the United States' campaign through hosting events for enlisted men and their families. In additon, fifty of the club's members served in the war effort. Following the war, the club prospered reaching a record high of eight hundred and fifty members in 1929. This number was cut in half by 1934 with the onset of the Great Depression. The Board of Governors began a large scale renovation of the building on Sixtieth Street under the expertise of architect Benjamin Morris in the late 1930's. The new facilities along with a series of changes in the club's bylaws were designed to modernize the organization and did attract a large number of new and young members. The growth of the Club was halted in 1941 with the American entry into World War II. The Harmonie Club continued to operate throughout the war and resumed its philanthropic programs from World War I, such as hosting functions for enlisted men. Following the war, the Club's membership returned to pre-Depression numbers. The Harmonie Club still exists today and regularly hosts social functions as well as educational and entertainment events.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Harmonie Club Records (1852 - 1947) consist of eleven linear feet of material. The bulk of the papers dates from 1860 until 1935 and consists primarily of minutes and scrapbooks, but also includes photographic materials, membership directories, logs, and other printed materials. The collection records the day to day club proceedings and captures the administrative functions from its founding until after World War II. The majority of the early documents are in handwritten German from 1852 until 1892. Though the founding members were almost exclusively New York Jews of German decent, the records contain little overt discussion of the Jewish American and immigrant experiences.</p>

                    <p>Bound ledgers of minutes run from the Harmonie Club's founding in 1852 until 1995, with gaps from the mid-1930's to the mid-1950's. The series has been split into four subseries: General Minutes, Secretary Minutes, Board of Governors Minutes, and the final subseries contains all other committee and club minutes. The ledgers are entitled by the wording on the spine followed by anything written on the cover. In the event the cover is missing or blank, the volume is listed as the subseries name. The majority of the books have additional documents stuck in-between the pages or cover; for the most part these are directly related to the function and period encompassed in the ledger. Where necessary documents have been removed from the pages, foldered, and placed in the back cover. The minutes are handwritten until 1915, but items pasted into the books are a mix of typed and handwritten document throughout the series.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains the earliest minutes of the Harmonie Club and contain a variety of financial information, membership lists, and reports. Several of the volumes have been supplemented by glued in quarterly budgets, other minutes, Tage-Ordnung (Agendas), reports from Club officers, committee minutes, correspondence, and other documents. The majority of the General Minutes are in German, but beginning in 1865 with a Tage-Ordnung there is a slow switch to English. From 1865 to the 1880s only glued in materials are in English, but by 1890 minutes handwritten in German becomes increasingly scarce. The fourth book in the subseries contains a number of notable documents including the membership laws and the legal forms required to remain operating as a social club during Prohibition. The presence of such documents from the 1920s appears to be a filing mistake.</p>

                        <p>The Secretary Minutes are almost exclusively in English and the majority of the information is on loose paper that has been pasted into the ledgers. For the most part the books are in good condition, but there is some yellowing of the glue that has adversely affected the paper. Only a small amount of material are archetypal minutes taken during board proceeding. Instead the ledgers capture the organization's function through committee reports, membership candidates, presidential addresses, bills, revised constitutions, and budgetary information. Includes cards with the name and dates of members who died. Starting April 1922 the ledger is switched to a ringed binder from bound pages, allowing the minutes to be typed on loose paper and inserted using a holepunch instead of having to glue in typed minutes.</p>

                        <p>The final subseries is comprised of all other minutes found in the Harmonie Club Collections. Most of the volumes are the records of particular committees, but only represent a short duration of their existence. Reports and recommendations made by the committees can be found throughout the previous three subseries, often glued into the ledgers. Two of the volumes are the records of clubs founded within the Harmonie Club. The Thursday Evening Bowling Club was one of many bowling clubs founded to ensure members would have exclusive rights to the alleys located inside the Harmonie Club's building on a particular night. Each club was named by the day of the week its members bowled. The Thursday Evening Bowling Clubs records include meeting minutes, membership lists, correspondence, and its own constitution. The Minutes of the Board of Governors of the North Shore Country Club is composed of typed papers inserted into a three hole binder. The Country Club was established March 13, 1914 for the benefit of the Harmonie Club members and its Board of Governors was composed of Harmonie Club officers. The minutes include budgest, expenses, renovation plans, and description of the grounds.</p>

                    <p>The Scrapbooks compose the second largest series of the collection and are bound books organized chronologically. Each volume encompasses several years and is composed of announcements, invitations, advertisements, brochures, playbills, postcards, mailings, programs, and menus all stapled or glued onto the pages and pertaining to the Harmonie Club. An unknown person wrote notes in the margins providing dates, cost of events, addresses, and other information. Until 1903 the majority of the handwriting and pasted in ephemera are in German. Several of the books contain loose pages and where needed such items have been foldered and placed into the back cover.</p>

                    <p>The two portrait books were compiled by Frank C. Baker and are composed of photographs of the Harmonie Club Members. One hundred fifty-nine of these portraits were taken by Alman &amp; Co. and the remaining forty-nine are of unknown provenance. Each page of the volume has several photograph windows mounted with the name of each member below their image. Volume One contains an alphabetic index of the members with page numbers as the photos are not arranged in the same manner. The second volume continues the page numbering from the first and is encompassed in Volume One's index.</p>
