<p>George Ziegler Bretz was the son of Jacob and Mary Ann (Boyer) Bretz. He was an 1851 graduate of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. He married Catherine St. John Reynolds April 23, 1856, and fathered George Brewster (b. 03/30/59) and Morris St. John (b. 1860, d. 05/24/60). Catherine died May 12, 1860. In 1860, he was a dentist presumably living in Brooklyn, New York, although he is not found in that census. He also earned a medical degree from Long Island Medical School in 1864.</p><p>A Civil War veteran, he returned to Pennsylvania where he enlisted and mustered into federal service at Harrisburg January 8, 1862, as assistant surgeon for the 101st Pennsylvania Infantry. Part of a mass capture on April 20, 1864, at Plymouth, North Carolina, he ended up in the stockade at Andersonville, Georgia, in charge of twenty-two wounded or sick men, but later transferred to Charleston, South Carolina. Following parole and a thirty-day furlough, he returned to the regiment and, although he received promotion to the rank of full surgeon on June 20, 1865, he never mustered at the rank because he honorably discharged June 25, 1865. He also enlisted and mustered into federal service July 24, 1865, as assistant surgeon with 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry (80th Pa) and honorably discharged with the regiment August 25, 1865, at Huntsville, Alabama.</p><p>Bretz died on December 4, 1909. The cause of his death was gas asphyxiation, ruled to be accidental.</p>    <list type="ordered">

<p>Dr. George Ziegler Bretz was born in 1825 and married Catherine (Kate) St. John Reynolds in 1856. Kate was born to Morris and Sarah Ann Reynolds in 1832 and attended the Greenleaf Female Institute in Brooklyn. Kate and George's son George Brewster Bretz was born in 1859. Kate died shortly after giving birth to a second son, Morris St. John Bretz, in May of 1860, followed soon thereafter by the infant himself. George Z. Bretz, Kate Bretz, and their infant son Morris are all entombed in the catacombs at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.</p><p>George Brewster Bretz went on to marry Margaret "Maggie" Ellen Briggs in 1887. Briggs had attended the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights, graduating in 1884. They had two children, Harold Brewster (1889-1924) and Margaret Louise (born 1894). Like her mother, Margaret L. Bretz attended Packer. Harold B. Bretz married Helen Ingersoll Cram in 1915, and Margaret L. Bretz married Schuyler J. Bergen in 1921. George B. Bretz died in 1909, the same year as his father George Z. Bretz.</p>  </bioghist>
