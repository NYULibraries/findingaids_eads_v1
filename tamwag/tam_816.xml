    <abstract id="aspace_0f2bf6282437561168c2afb6fff2a6d7">Founded in 2018, the Prison Education Program (PEP) Research Lab is a collaboration between faculty and formerly incarcerated students at New York University conducting research on the financial and human costs of mass incarceration in New York State. Students with lived experiences of incarceration are hired by the Lab, and trained by faculty members in the methods and ethics of social research. Formerly incarcerated researchers take part in all aspects of the research, from identifying research questions to design, data collection, and dissemination. By drawing on researchers from New York communities most affected by incarceration, the PEP Research Lab aims to amplify their voices and concerns, and to generate grounded policy recommendations and advocacy initiatives around responsible decarceration in the city and the state. NYU professors Julie Livingston (Social and Cultural Analysis and History), Thuy Linh Tu (Social and Cultural Analysis) and Andrew Ross (Social and Cultural Analysis) started the Debt and Incarceration oral history project in the fall of 2018. Working with PEP students Joshua Barreto, Jos√© Diaz, Derick McCarthy, and Vincent Thompson, Livingston, Tu and Ross began conducting in-depth interviews with formerly incarcerated New Yorkers about the financial challenges they faced after release. In particular, those conversations focused on narrators' experiences with financial debt and on how their, often significant, debt burden was connected with incarceration. The Prison Education Program Research Lab Oral Histories on Debt and Incarceration (dated 2019-2021) consists of pdf oral history transcripts created by the PEP Research Lab. The majority of the anonymized interview transcripts in this collection were conducted as part of a PEP study on the commissary system in New York State prisons led by Tommaso Bardelli, Thuy Linh Tu, and Zachary Gillespie. The interviews document the multiple financial costs people face to cover basic needs during their incarceration. In an additional effort Bardelli, Tu, and Gillespie interviewed over 60 formerly incarcerated New Yorkers who had been released from male prison facilities in New York State within the past four years about their experiences with the commissary system and other forms of consumer spending in prison. These interviews document how decades of fiscal austerity, and the privatization of basic services within the prison system progressively shifted the economic costs of incarceration onto prisoners and their families. They also shed light on the pervasive impact of austerity policies on the realities of carceral punishment, the extension of the carceral state into the lives of individuals and families, sites of incarceration as sites of financial extraction, and the everyday lives of incarcerated individuals.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Founded in 2018, the Prison Education Program (PEP) Research Lab is a collaboration between faculty and formerly incarcerated students at NYU conducting research on the financial and human costs of mass incarceration in New York State. Students with lived experiences of incarceration are hired by the Lab, and trained by faculty members in the methods and ethics of social research. Formerly incarcerated researchers take part in all aspects of the research, from identifying research questions to design, data collection, and dissemination. By drawing on researchers from New York communities most affected by incarceration, the PEP Research Lab aims to amplify their voices and concerns, and to generate grounded policy recommendations and advocacy initiatives around responsible decarceration in the city and the state.      </p><p>NYU professors Julie Livingston (Social and Cultural Analysis and History), Thuy Linh Tu (Social and Cultural Analysis) and Andrew Ross (Social and Cultural Analysis) started the Debt and Incarceration oral history project in the fall of 2018. Working with PEP students Joshua Barreto, Jos√© Diaz, Derick McCarthy, and Vincent Thompson, Livingston, Tu and Ross began conducting in-depth interviews with formerly incarcerated New Yorkers about the financial challenges they faced after release. In particular, those conversations focused on narrators' experiences with financial debt and on how their, often significant, debt burden was connected with incarceration. After conducting those initial interviews, the Lab's researchers launched a series of studies on the relationship between debt and incarceration in New York City, documenting different forms of carceral debt ‚Äì from prison commissary and telecommunication costs to traffic fines and predatory auto loans. </p><p>Most of the interviews included in the present collection were conducted as part of a study on the commissary system in New York State prisons. The study was led by Tommaso Bardelli, who had joined the Lab as a postdoctoral fellow in September 2019, Thuy Linh Tu, and Zach Gillespie, an NYU PEP student majoring in American Studies. By focusing on the prison commissary system, their goal was to shed light on the multiple financial costs people face just to cover basic needs during their incarceration. Between October 2019 and September 2020, Bardelli, Tu, and Gillespie interviewed over 60 formerly incarcerated New Yorkers about their experiences with commissary and other forms of consumer spending in prison.</p><p>
The collection includes a total of 25 transcripts of interviews conducted by Lab's researchers. Transcripts 001, 002, 003, 004, 006, 007, 010 are from the first series of exploratory interviews about the commissary system, which Bardelli and Tu collected with PEP students and alumni during the fall of 2019. Those interviews were conducted in person on NYU Washington Square campus. Transcripts numbered from 106 to 134, as well as 223 and 232, are part of the second series of commissary interviews with formerly incarcerated New Yorkers and their families (223, 232), collected between January and October 2020. Bardelli and Gillespie were the lead interviewers for this series, and all conversations were conducted remotely (via phone or video calling) due the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  </bioghist>

prison often cut back on portions and particular meals, which forced people to spend their money at the
commissary store. He recounts price increases and product shortages at commissary, and talks about the
help he received from his family, particularly his wife, in the form of money and packages. He explains
that "side hustles" and participation in the prison informal economy are what help incarcerated people
afford basic necessities, but that either could result in accrued debt and violent retaliation from other
prisoners. This interview sheds light on the financial difficulty of surviving inside prison and how the
informal economy is a lifeline to incarcerated individuals while also creating the potential for debt and
violence.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_41ce4513a422ee7e815f793b65b1393e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Narrator 106</unittitle><unitid>cuid36514</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_3512dc9455e55a78ca4a5b9e8d6af8cb" label="Electronic records" type="Box">Electronic Records</container><container parent="aspace_3512dc9455e55a78ca4a5b9e8d6af8cb" type="E-records">TW_TAM_816_ER_8</container></did><dao ns2:actuate="onLoad" ns2:href="https://aeon.library.nyu.edu/Logon?Action=10&amp;Form=31&amp;Value=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/ead/tamwag/tam_816.xml&amp;view=xml" ns2:role="translation missing: en.enumerations.file_version_use_statement.electronic-records-reading-room" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="Narrator 106" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Narrator 106</p></daodesc></dao><bioghist id="aspace_2dd5e282cee23923c9619ff386332b55"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Narrator 106 was in his mid-twenties at the time of this interview.

set by the prison and how they limited him in terms of receiving packages and money for commissary from

people have to rely on outside support systems, which often includes family members, because most of the
food served at the mess hall is low quality and not enough to survive on. He recalls receiving food
packages from his mother, which were meaningful to him because they are extremely expensive,
time-consuming to put together, and strictly regulated by prisons. He also explains the importance of
friendship inside prison in terms of sharing food items and splitting up tasks like cooking and cleaning.

can be exchanged for snacks and other items. This interview sheds light on the necessity of outside

Growing up, he was an
outgoing, adventurous, and very curious kid. Narrator 132 was incarcerated for 13 years, and started his
educational journey in his twelfth year in prison. At the time of the interview, he was pursuing his B.A. and
working as a multimedia artist and visual storyteller.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_3c4c8ed105ed29de7262a186c354192a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this interview, Narrator 132 discusses how he had to survive on the bare minimum while he was
incarcerated due to a lack of funds. He purchased necessities at the commissary store with the little
money he made from his state job. He got by, by exchanging food he took from the mess hall for stamps or
cigarettes, which functioned as forms of currency, or for other food items he needed. Narrator 132 also
went to "stores" or "jugglers" and racked up a small amount of debt in order to buy snacks and other
items. He explains that many other people inside were struggling like him and could not afford to max out
at commissary. This interview sheds light on the function of jobs inside prison in facilitating exchanges
through the informal economy, which allow incarcerated people to scrape by.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_219315e2eccf70d2bd832d959516fea7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Narrator 134</unittitle><unitid>cuid36526</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_b5bc9676ced46723c8524fdde08c0930" label="Electronic records" type="Box">Electronic Records</container><container parent="aspace_b5bc9676ced46723c8524fdde08c0930" type="E-records">TW_TAM_816_ER_20</container></did><dao ns2:actuate="onLoad" ns2:href="https://aeon.library.nyu.edu/Logon?Action=10&amp;Form=31&amp;Value=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/ead/tamwag/tam_816.xml&amp;view=xml" ns2:role="translation missing: en.enumerations.file_version_use_statement.electronic-records-reading-room" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="Narrator 134" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Narrator 134</p></daodesc></dao><bioghist id="aspace_a39dca4705966cffd187df4ebbf45f2d"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Narrator 134 was born and raised in New York City.

from his family members, friends, and girlfriends. They sent him packages with luxury items that were a
mark of his status inside prison, as well as money for commissary. He describes the economic hierarchy
inside prison, and how he would help out people in need, especially through his job as a porter and his
gang membership. In addition, he leveraged his job as a porter to make extra money by selling illicit
items within the prison and participated in the informal economy by gambling, reselling cigarettes, and
selling drugs. This interview sheds light on how prisons are often segregated by status, social standing,
ethnicity, and gang affiliation, as well as the ways specific jobs can facilitate trading through the informal
economy.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c30502f17097b0a1413c06b00dba9ced" level="file"><did><unittitle>Narrator 223</unittitle><unitid>cuid36527</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_43b67c0f4be00ebf43cf38c2f978c573" label="Electronic records" type="Box">Electronic Records</container><container parent="aspace_43b67c0f4be00ebf43cf38c2f978c573" type="E-records">TW_TAM_816_ER_21</container></did><dao ns2:actuate="onLoad" ns2:href="https://aeon.library.nyu.edu/Logon?Action=10&amp;Form=31&amp;Value=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/ead/tamwag/tam_816.xml&amp;view=xml" ns2:role="translation missing: en.enumerations.file_version_use_statement.electronic-records-reading-room" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="Narrator 223" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Narrator 223</p></daodesc></dao><bioghist id="aspace_d0bd44b49d87ee5f0eea705c5cce8212"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Narrator 223, who was in her mid-fifties at the time of this interview, was born and raised in the Bronx,

people and their isolation during the pandemic. He recounts how the few promotional benefits they
offered such as free stamps and messages encouraged more spending as incarcerated people had no other
means of communicating with loved ones during lockdown. The lack of recreation, visitation, and mail all
led to a dramatic increase in tablet usage for both communication and entertainment, thus increasing
profits for JPay. This interview sheds light on the predatory, profit-driven nature of JPay's services and
how incarcerated people are often taken advantage of financially by such corporations, particularly
during a tumultuous time like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_557dad2839fb9b34223cf7425f5eed3f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Student Researchers Interview</unittitle><unitid>cuid36531</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_43d31ea22f82eadc330d45d6498464e0" label="Electronic records" type="Box">Electronic Records</container><container parent="aspace_43d31ea22f82eadc330d45d6498464e0" type="E-records">TW_TAM_816_ER_25</container></did><dao ns2:actuate="onLoad" ns2:href="https://aeon.library.nyu.edu/Logon?Action=10&amp;Form=31&amp;Value=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/ead/tamwag/tam_816.xml&amp;view=xml" ns2:role="translation missing: en.enumerations.file_version_use_statement.electronic-records-reading-room" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="Student Researchers Interview" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Student Researchers Interview</p></daodesc></dao><bioghist id="aspace_0a3cd0bbe7ed12faf7290fd284467a00"><head>Historical Note</head><p>Zachary Gillespie is an undergraduate student in NYU's Department of Social and Cultural Analysis,

their transition from prison inmates and students to their training as student researchers in the PEP

about the welfare and treatment of those caught within the prison system. Discussing their post-carceral
roles as students and researchers, they analyze the differences between the two, drawing particular
attention to the social status accorded to researchers. Building on the independence and resources offered
by PEP's Research Lab, they describe the initiatives they have taken to launch new paths of inquiry into
carceral life and the financial and social burdens that continue to afflict formerly incarcerated on reentry.</p></scopecontent></c></dsc>
