            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>(Robert) Coleman Dowell was born to Mordon and Beulah Dowell in Adairville, Kentucky on May 29, 1925. Dowell attended several country schools, among them, a one room schoolhouse where Latin and Greek were taught. His last two years of high school were at Simpson County High in Franklin, a new county school where he was on the school paper. Dowell served in the U.S. Army, Medical Corps from 1944-45 and as an assistant to the prosecution in war crimes trials in Manila in 1945-46. He was eventually promoted to the rank of sergeant. During this period he also attended the University of the Philippines. Dowell returned home to the U.S. in 1946 and settled in Louisville for a few years where he was a full-time member of the National Guard. Here, he wrote the musical play that brought him to New York</p>
            <p>Dowell moved to New York City in 1950, initially finding work as a model for automobile and airline ads and as a typist. From 1950-53 Dowell was employed as a song writer and lyricist for the Dumont television show, 
                <emph render="italic">Once Upon a Tune</emph>, which starred Bea Arthur, Elaine Stritch, Alice Ghostley, and Charlotte Rae. Dowell composed nearly 1,000 works for weekly broadcast. He also worked as David Merrick's protege and with John LaTouche on the abortive Broadway musical version of Eugene O'Neill's 
                <emph render="italic">Ah, Wilderness!</emph>. 1957 was a pivotal year for Dowell. It was in January of this year that he managed to meet Carl Van Vechten, author of 
                <emph render="italic">The Tattooed Countess</emph>. Dowell wanted permission to attempt to adapt the piece to the musical stage. He played for Van Vechten selections from a score for 
                <emph render="italic">The Tattooed Countess</emph> and won Van Vechten's approval for the rights. Carl Van Vechten was known to his friends as "Carlo." His career included stints as a music critic for the 
                <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, as a novelist during the 1920s, and as a photographer for which he never sought nor received payment. He photographed many of the major figures in the arts world. His wife was Fania Marinoff, a retired actress. Van Vechten introduced Dowell into his circle of friends which included many celebrities: Isak Dinesen, Langston Hughes, Leontyne Price, Geoffrey Holder, Gloria Vanderbilt, Sidney Lumet, Eileen Herlie, Kim Hunter, Barbra Streisand, Dianne Carroll, Pearl Bailey, Anthony Armstrong Jones, Tallulah Bankhead, Luise Rainer, Laurence Olivier, Gertrude Stein, the Gish sisters, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, George Kaufman, Noel Coward, and Maurice Sendak, among others.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">The Tattooed Countess</emph>, which opened in 1961, was panned by the critics and closed within a few days. Dowell, who had written the book, score and lyrics, tried his luck with another theatrical experiment, 
                <emph render="italic">Eve of the Green Grass</emph>. This play was presented at the Chelsea Art Theatre in 1965 and starred Kim Hunter. Seeing his play on the stage, Dowell concluded that the theatre was not his metier and turned his attention to writing novels. This was done without the mourning that the failure of 
                <emph render="italic">The Tattooed Countess</emph> had induced. Dowell's early experiences in the theatre were used in two magazine articles, "At Home with Drosselmeier" and "A Handful of Anomalies" which were published in 
                <emph render="italic">Bomb</emph> Magazine in 1984 and 1985, respectively. His theatrical career was also included in his unfinished autobiography, 
                <title render="underline" type="simple">A Dark Book</title>, which was published by The Dalkey Archive Press in June 1993 under the title: 
                <title render="underline" type="simple">A Star-bright Lie</title>.</p>
            <p>Dowell had found only disillusionment in the theater. He decided to seek his fortune as a writer of fiction. Dowell had already experienced some success in writing fiction. His short story, "Alter Frau im Garten" had been published in 1962. Over a fifteen year period Dowell wrote five novels: 
                <emph render="italic">One of the Children is Crying </emph>(1968), 
                <emph render="italic">Mrs. October was Here </emph>(1974), 
                <emph render="italic">Island People</emph> (1976), 
                <emph render="italic">Too Much Flesh and Jabez</emph> (1977), and 
                <emph render="italic">White on Black on White</emph> (1983). Remarkably, the first four novels had been written concurrently. These novels were intricate both in concept and in form. It was during this period that Dowell enjoyed the critical praise and friendship of such noted authors as Walter Abish, Thom Gunn, John Hawkes, Ann Lauterbach, Gilbert Sorrentino, Maurice Sendak, Edmund White, and Tennessee Williams.</p>
            <p>Dowell was talented and he yearned to be famous. He very much needed a popular readership. 
                <emph render="italic">One of the Children is Crying</emph>, one of his most accessible books, was widely reviewed, with reviews appearing in Boston, Denver, Hollywood, Houston, Louisville, Milwaukee, Sacramento, and Tulsa. Since 
                <emph render="italic">One of the Children is Crying</emph> had been published earlier in England under the title, 
                <emph render="italic">The Grass Dies</emph>, reviews also appeared in England and Ireland. Surprisingly, reviews for Dowell's second novel, 
                <emph render="italic">Mrs. October was Here</emph>, were meager and from rather obscure sources. Nevertheless, this novel was always mentioned as being Dowell's favorite. 
                <emph render="italic">Island People</emph> was a favorite with critics and other authors, and was called Dowell's masterpiece. Supporters of this novel included Tennessee Williams, Gilbert Sorrentino, Ihab Hassan, and Walter Abish, but reviews were still not as plentiful as had been the case with his first novel. 
                <title render="italic">The New York Times</title> called it "a work of art" and brought Dowell some national attention. 
                <emph render="italic">Too Much Flesh and Jabez</emph> was the least reviewed of Dowell's novels. 
                <title render="italic">The New York Times</title>, nevertheless, called it "a tour de force." 
                <emph render="italic">White on Black on White</emph> received many, but mixed, reviews. Dowell was given a tribute before the publication of his last novel in the Fall 1982 issue of 
                <emph render="italic">The Review of Contemporary Fiction</emph>. This issue, called the Paul Bowles-Coleman Dowell number, contains the major critical articles on Dowell which had appeared up to this date.</p>
            <p>Three different journals published nearly all of Dowell's short fiction. 
                <title render="italic">New Directions: An Anthology of Prose and Poetry</title> published the following titles: "The Keepsake" (#26, 1973), "The Birthmark" (#27, 1973), "I Envy You Your Adventure" (#28, 1974), "First Person Biography" (#29, 1974), "Victor: (#30, 1975), "If Beggars were Horses" (#31, 1975), "Singing in the Clump" (#32, 1976), "The Moon, the Owl, my Sister" (#33, 1976), "Ham's Gift" (#35, 1977), and "My Father was a River" (#36, 1978). The English quarterly, 
                <title render="italic">Ambit</title>, published the following titles: "I am the Beast" (#61, 1975), "The Drought Ends" (#65, 1976), "Her Good Man Gone" (#69, 1977), "A Lifetime Proposition" (#73, 1978), "Patridge House" (#76, 1978), "The Snake House" (#79, 1979), "The Silver Swanne" (#89, 1980), "Person Waiting" (#94, 1983), and "Kitty" (#100, 1985). 
                <title render="italic">Conjunctions</title> published "The Great Godalmighty Bird" (#4, 1983), "Eve of the Green Grass" (novel excerpt) (#6, 1984), and "Writings on a Cave Wall" (#8, 1985). As has been already stated, "Old Woman in a Garden" or "Alte Frau im Garten" (translation by Ruth Landskoff-Yorck) was published in 
                <title render="italic">Frankfurter Hefte</title>in 1962. "Handy" appeared in 
                <title render="italic">Kentucky Renaissance</title> in 1976, and "The Hobo" appeared in 
                <title render="italic">ADENA</title> in Spring 1986. During 1983 both 
                <title render="italic">Conjunctions</title> and 
                <title render="italic">Grenfell Press</title> republished "The Silver Swanne" which 
                <title render="italic">Conjunctions</title> editor, Bradford Morrow, in "Postscript," 
                <title render="underline" type="simple">The Houses of Children: Collected Stories</title> (1987) termed Dowell's greatest work of short fiction. It should also be noted that Dowell reviewed books for the 
                <title render="italic">Courier-Journal</title> of Louisville, Kentucky from 1978-1985.</p>
            <p>Dowell received critical praise from the leading authors and critics of his day. He never received the popular support he so desperately needed. His later years were plagued by ill health. Although there were good times, Dowell could not escape feelings of disillusionment, suicide, or as he put it, "the balcony beckons me." In the early morning hours on Saturday August 3, 1985, Dowell leapt from his 15th floor apartment balcony overlooking Fifth Avenue. As is the case with so many other writers or artists, the attention focused on Coleman Dowell accelerated after his death. In 1987, 
                <emph render="italic">The Houses of Children: Collected Stories</emph> was published by Weidenfeld and Nicholson and this publishing company also reissued 
                <emph render="italic">One of the Children is Crying</emph>. 
                <emph render="italic">Too Much Flesh and Jabez</emph> was also made available via the Dalkey Archive Press.</p>
            <p>Three major works by Dowell were left unfinished. These include 
                <emph render="italic">Eve of the Green Grass</emph>, a novel; Dowell's autobiography entitled, 
                <emph render="italic">A Dark Book</emph> and his private journal 1968-1984 which is a running diary of his life, writings, attitude towards people, and also includes personal observations for stories. Two excerpts from 
                <emph render="italic">A Dark Book</emph> had been published earlier in 
                <emph render="italic">Bomb</emph> magazine under the titles: "At Home with Drosselmeier" (#10, Fall 1984) and "A Handful of Anomalies" (#13, Fall 1985). These deal with Dowell's early adventures in New York City and his relationship with Carl Van Vechten, as well as his early theatrical career.</p>
            <p>Dowell was given a final tribute at his apartment on November 3, 1985. A large number of famous personalities representing the worlds of dance, art, literature, music, theater, and education toasted their friend and praised his accomplishments as a gifted composer, poet, playwright, novelist, and critic.</p>

            <p>The Coleman Dowell Papers includes correspondence, musical scores and lyrics, photographs, and ephemera, as well as the texts of three major unfinished works: a novel, a private journal, and an autobiography. The latter, which Dowell had entitled 
                <emph render="italic">A Dark Book</emph>, was published in 1993 as 
                <emph render="italic">A Star-Bright Lie</emph>. The 2008 Accretion includes all of the above, as well as an audio recording of Dowell singing some of his songs. The accretion also contains various materials related to the publication of 
                <emph render="italic">A Star-Bright Lie</emph>, as well Bertrand Slaff's attempts to publish Dowell's journals.</p>

                    <p>Series II: Published and Unpublished Works, contains reviews pertaining to Dowell's published works, and some correspondence, mostly from friends or admirers regarding a particular novel, short story, etc. This series is divided into two subseries: Subseries A: Novels and Short Stories; and Subseries B: Plays and Dramatic Writings. The bulk of Dowell's published works is novels; unpublished material consists of plays, poems, and miscellaneous writings. Much of the materials in Subseries B are copies of Dowell's published novels or plays which he used as research material for other projects. The series also contains The Great Godalmighty Bird- a long, unpublished play with songs, personal correspondence, lists of scenes for the plays and themes, and short two- or three-character plays.</p>

                    <p>Series III: Musical Works and Lyrics, spans the years from the 1950s to 1960s. The bulk of the material falls in the year 1961 when Dowell's largest theatrical work, 
                        <title render="italic">The Tattooed Countess</title>, opened on Broadway. The work contains book, lyrics, and score by Dowell and signifies the major effort of his theatrical production. Dowell's second largest musical effort, Haymarket, although unfinished, also contains a large number of musical works and lyrics. Most of Dowell's theatrical works are heavily annotated. The lists of song titles included in this material provide an opportunity to study Dowell's creative processes, as he changed or reworked his material. It is not unusual to find a lyric assigned to one of Dowell's musicals also appearing in another of his theatrical works.</p>
                    <p>Dowell's music and lyrics from the 1950-1953 television series, Once Upon A Tune, are included in the Collection. Although Dowell composed nearly one thousand songs for the weekly broadcast of this show over its run, most of these are not included in his papers.</p>
