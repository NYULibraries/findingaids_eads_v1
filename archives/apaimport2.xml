            <head>History of the Asian/Pacific/American Institute</head>
            <p>The Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) Institute was founded in 1996. The Institute is focused on community and intercultural studies within a broad, rigorous international and comparative framework.</p>
            <p>The A/P/A Institute produces public events and symposia for the larger New York University and New York City communities. The Institute brings together accomplished scholars, community builders, and artists from New York City and beyond for events throughout the year, including conferences, seminars, book readings, film screenings, musical performances, and brown bag lunches. The Institute also co-sponsors events with student and community organizations, which complement the academic programs offered by the University and address the needs of the community at large.</p>
            <p>The A/P/A has collaborated on several events and activities with the Office for African American, Latino, and Asian American Student Services (OASIS). OASIS was created in 1988 in response to the expressed needs of students of color for more University administrative support and commitment. Today the mission of OASIS continues to be carried out by the Center for Multicultural Education and Programs (CMEP) at NYU.</p>
            <p>The A/P/A Institute also reached out to youth in New York City through the Asian Pacific American Youth Alliance (APAYA) from 1994-2008. This was a free program led by A/P/A and community volunteers throughout the school year that sought to support and encourage high school youth to become community leaders. These students learned about and taught others about the vibrant and diverse Asian Pacific American history, cultures, and experiences. Their weekly meetings throughout the school year culminated in a forum at NYU planned and led by APAYA students.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>The records of the Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) Institute, dated 1994-2006, document the activities of the Institute from its founding in 1996 and reflect student events, faculty affairs and collaboration with the A/P/A studies program. The collection contains photographs, memoranda, correspondence, student surveys, meeting and conference agendas, syllabi, proposals, posters, flyers, and brochures. It also includes audio cassettes, VHS tapes, and mini DVs.</p>
            <p>The collection is divided into five series.</p>
            <p>Series I contains information on the preparation and production of the 
                <emph render="italic">Asians in America</emph> conference from 1994-1998, as well as other conferences of interest to the A/P/A community including 
                <emph render="italic">Where is Home? Annual Conference for Chinese in the Americas</emph>, held in 1997 and 
                <emph render="italic">Public Displays of Asianness</emph>, held in 1998. The records generally pertain to conference logistics, planning, and publicity.</p>
            <p>Series II is divided into three subseries that relate to specific A/P/A staff members.</p>
            <p>Subseries A contains records pertaining to Sheelagh Cabalda's work at the Office for African American, Latino and Asian American Student Services (OASIS) in collaboration with A/P/A. This subseries documents various conferences, workshops and events produced by OASIS, A/P/A and other institutions. These records provide an understanding of student activities and events related to A/P/A Institute.</p>
            <p>Subseries B contains correspondence, memoranda, and reports related to the further development of the A/P/A studies academic program. This includes new course proposals, staff and faculty job descriptions, the development of a mission statement, departmental magazines, and the creation of an alumni association. These records reflect the planning involved in the ongoing development of the academic program.</p>
            <p>Subseries C includes general course information related to the A/P/A program in addition to various events sponsored by the department. This subseries contains syllabi, course evaluations, course proposals and event records.</p>
            <p>Series III consists of information regarding various events and activities produced and sponsored by the A/P/A Institute. These records are primarily comprised of outreach materials, such as posters, brochures, and flyers. The majority of these events are art-related, such as gallery exhibitions, author reading series, and film screenings. Events also include lectures and discussions regarding various issues relevant to the A/P/A student community. Many of these events were documented either on film or audio. These recordings are included in the collection. This series is divided into three subseries: a series of general materials organized alphabetically, a series of posters, and a series of general materials organized chronologically. The material in Subseries 3 was received at a later date, and its chronological organization has been retained.</p>
            <p>Series IV includes photographs of various events, students, faculty, and staff of the A/P/A Institute and the A/P/A studies program.</p>
            <p>Series V contains material on the Asian Pacific American Youth Alliance (APAYA), including program activities, surveys, and material pertaining to planning and logistics.</p>
            <p>Series VI contains recordings, in a variety of formats, of various lectures, symposia, and performances sponsored by the Institute.</p>
