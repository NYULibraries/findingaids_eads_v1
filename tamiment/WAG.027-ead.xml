            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Frank Schonfeld was born in 1916, and died in 2011. After some training as a rabbi, he studied in the Social Action program at the New School. After World War II service in the Merchant Marines, he joined Local 1011 of the Painters union in 1945. In 1961, Schonfeld ran for secretary-treasurer of Brotherhood of Painters District Council 9 (New York City). He lost and the winning Rarback administration sued him for libel. He then launched a public campaign to clean up corruption in the union. Blocked from running in 1964, in 1966 he ran for secretary-treasurer and won. He held office for two terms, during which time he carried out a number of reforms to combat union corruption. In 1972, he was found guilty by a union trial board on charges later determined to be unfounded. Schonfeld's campaign to end union corruption led to the eventual indictments of key leaders. This collection provides an inside view of a trade distinguished by highly volatile employment cycles, corrupt practices, and successive waves of different ethnic groups making up the workforce. It includes correspondence, flyers, election materials, legal documents, agreements, bulletins and clippings.

            <p>These papers were created and collected by Frank Schonfeld while a member and officer of the Painters District Council 9 (New York City) and his home Local, 1011 (which was later merged and became part of Local Union 19). The earliest records, dating from 1910 to 1927, were given to him by older members of his union. Other records date from Schonfeld's membership in the union, beginning in 1945, his years as secretary-treasurer of the District Council, 1967-1973, and from his later life. The records described here were donated to the Tamiment Library/Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives in 1984 by Mr. Schonfeld. A later donation, given in 1999, is not described in this finding aid.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Frank Schonfeld was born in 1916. A rabbi's son and grandson, Schonfeld was groomed to join the family profession. He attended Yeshiva College, where he received his Bachelor's degree in philosophy, psychology, and education. With World War II looming, Schonfeld concluded that he could not preach what he no longer believed. He turned to the labor movement because he considered it to be the most important contemporary force to counter fascism, racism, and war.</p>
            <p>Schonfeld attended the Rochdale Institute and joined the cooperative movement, went into factory work, and took a one-year course at the New School with Roger Baldwin (founder of the American Civil Liberties Union), whose Social Action program provided Schonfeld with useful organizing tools and experience. Schonfeld joined the Merchant Marines in 1943. During the war, he married his lifelong companion, Jean, and the couple moved to the Amalgamated Clothing Workers' first housing cooperative in the Bronx in 1945. That same year, Schonfeld joined the Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators and Paperhangers of America (later the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades). His first official position in the union was as recording secretary of Local Union 1011, the Jewish local.</p>
            <p>The membership of the Brotherhood of Painters in New York City generally reflected the various waves of immigrants coming into the country, the development of different political tendencies, and the tensions brought on by changes in the U.S. economy.</p>
            <p>Racketeers were a major force in Painters District Council 9 (as they were in many other NYC building trades unions) until the membership, under the leadership of Louis Weinstock's Communist Party-oriented administration, attempted to break their hold in the 1930s. Weinstock's alliance (with its base in the Rank-and-File Clubs) had its own drawbacks, and some members felt that their interests were neglected in favor of the CP's all-out efforts in support of World War II, including the no-strike pledge.</p>
            <p>In 1946, the Progressive Painters Club ran Martin Rarback as a new reform candidate for secretary-treasurer of the District, and he won the post in 1947. Rarback's promised militant program led to some progressive changes in the union, but he soon became a party to dubious practices that pre-dated his administration.</p>
            <p>In part, it was the nature of the painting trades that provided easy opportunities for kickback schemes, bid-rigging, favoritism, conspiracy, and other forms of corruption. The jobs were isolated, largely unsupervised by the union, and highly seasonal; there was often a shortage of work. The union business agents, who wielded considerable power, were responsible for placing workers, surveying worksite conditions, and negotiating with contractors. Without significant reforms to the so-called "job trust" or to the District Council 9, the door was open to racketeering Martin Rarback was indicted in 1966 in a major New York City Housing Authority bid-rigging and bribery conspiracy.</p>
            <p>After1947, the Rank-and-File Club carried on its opposition fight, but the Cold War political climate and the conservative drift of the labor movement made for an uphill battle, and the group experienced several years of setbacks, including the expulsion of its key leaders from the union. In spite of undercurrents of discontent, there were no contested district-wide elections from 1953 to 1961, and the Rank-and-File Club was barely able to maintain its presence in a few locals.</p>
            <p>By 1961, Rarback's blatant favoritism had created such dissatisfaction among members that organized opposition reasserted itself for the first time in many years. Reconstructing an opposition movement was hard work. Frank Schonfeld ran for District Coulcil 9 secretary-treasurer in 1961. He lost, but did so with 42% of the vote, a considerable turnout against Rarback's machine. The day after the 1961 election, the Rarback administration sued Schonfeld and others for libel, and Schonfeld lost his job. In response to these actions, and to strengthen and protect the growing dissident movement, he launched a public campaign, with help from Herman Benson, who went on to form the Association for Union Democracy, and Burton Hall, a labor attorney. A meeting was organized to support the development of an independent inter-union judiciary, to be patterned on the United Auto Workers' public review board. Speakers included Norman Thomas, the noted socialist, Dan House of the UAW, Herman Benson, and Schonfeld.</p>
            <p>The fight was on, in New York as well as in other parts of the country. Dissidents were physically beaten, and two, Dow Wilson and Lloyd Green, were assassinated in San Francisco. Others were dragged into court, and a running war of internal union charges and counter-charges ensued. The International, which in general supported the incumbent administration, was required to step in and impose a trusteeship in DC 9, a move that served to buffer the Rarback machine. Schonfeld was blocked from running in 1964. In 1966, in one of the many legal tactics he undertook with the assistance of Burton Hall, Schonfeld successfully challenged the trusteeship (Schonfeld v. Raftery). Schonfeld subsequently ran again for DC 9 secretary-treasurer, benefiting from the actions of the U.S. District Court Judge, who not only ordered a supervised, district-wide election, but also required the union to mail a copy of his 67-page opinion on the corrupt tactics of the incumbents to each union member. Schonfeld won. He held office for two terms, and was opposed almost continually during that time.</p>
            <p>Schonfeld carried out several reforms during his administration. These included revising the District Council by-laws to require that the American Arbitration Association (AAA) supervise district elections; ending restrictive nominating procedures (as well as the "packing" of locals during nominations); and stipulating that union insurance fund trustees be elected directly by membership. Shop stewards were limited to one-year terms and stewardships were distributed to the locals by lottery, thereby decentralizing Rarback's former network. Schonfeld also convened numerous district-wide membership meetings. In 1972, Schonfeld was brought up on internal union charges (see Penza v. Schonfeld). He was found guilty by the union trial board on charges later determined to be unfounded. The ousted machine campaigned heavily against him, and in 1973, Schonfeld lost his position to James Bishop, a candidate promoted by Rarback's Progressive Painters Club.</p>
            <p>While Schonfeld's status as an officer in the District Council ended with the 1973 election, he continued to fight for reform. He served as trustee of the insurance fund in 1977, and president of Bronx Local 19 in 1978. In 1977, Schonfeld's campaign against corruption in the District Council led to the imposition of another trusteeship. The 1977-78 trusteeship, imposed by the International union, helped consolidate the eighteen Painters locals into six, and established citywide election of business agents, with elections supervised by the AAA. However, the Bishop administration was successful in its attempts to evade the monitors, and at this point mob domination of the District Council solidified. Bishop was murdered by the mob in 1990, and the steady attrition of the District Council leadership through indictments, guilty pleas and jail sentences revealed the layers of corruption that had pervaded the Council since Schonfeld's ouster.</p>
            <p>After retiring from the union in 1982, Schonfeld remained very active in political and community affairs, serving on the board of the Amalgamated Housing Corporation as treasurer, while studying and volunteering at Lehman College in the Bronx, and working with Herman Benson and the Association for Union Democracy. He died on November 2, 2011.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Schonfeld Papers provide an inside view of a trade distinguished by highly volatile employment cycles, corrupt practices, and successive waves of different ethnic groups making up the workforce, and document the possibilities for establishing some degree of union democracy through rank-and-file campaigns.</p>
            <p>The history of the New York City Painters Union is also noteworthy because much of the litigation that grew out of its contentious environment resulted in legal precedents and reforms that have benefited members in other unions, and contributed to the formation of the Association for Union Democracy.</p>
            <p>Series I, Correspondence, includes notes and drafts of materials prepared by Schonfeld.</p>
            <p>Series II, Statements, includes materials by Louis Weinstock and Frank Schonfeld, as well as a statement from 1909 issued by Local Union 1011.</p>
            <p>Series III, Minutes, consists of minutes of District Council 9 meetings.</p>
            <p>Series IV, Financial Reports, contains financial reports of District Council 9.</p>
            <p>Series V, District Council 9 Trusteeship Records, includes the 1966-67 hearings on trusteeship in the wake of the Rarback corruption scandal; the 1977 trusteeship hearings; and material on the last trusteeship in 1990-91, following the murder of James Bishop.</p>
            <p>Series VI, Litigation Records, includes the Santos-Woodfinishers case, a jurisdictional fight with the Carpenters, corrupt practices of District Council 9 leaders, involving the transfer of work and jurisdiction of their own membership to competing unions in return for favors. Applications for wiretaps and progress reports issued to the court provide a wealth of information on corruption within DC 9. Additional materials, including press releases and rank-and-file flyers, reflect the complex course of events within DC 9 that landed it in the courts.</p>
            <p>Series VII, Internal Trials, includes cases involving employers as parties to the Master Painters and Master Contractors Association in regard to violations of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
            <p>Series VIII, Insurance Funds Records, includes minutes of meetings of the board of trustees; and related materials, including reports and publicity prepared by the opposition in efforts to expose the corrupt activities of the Fund managers. Simon Kesselman's correspondence, centering on mismanagement of the Painters annuity funds, illustrates the issues that fueled members' staunch opposition to the District leadership.</p>
            <p>Series IX, Subject Files, contains materials relating to the amalgamation of locals, the effort to establish a separate local for Civil Service Painters (Local 1969) and Tapers (Local 1974); and a failed attempt to set up a Florida retirement community, Holiday Park; as well as documentation of mass meetings, co-op activity, and health hazards for painters.</p>
            <p>Series X, Election Records, includes materials related to the contentious atmosphere that pervaded relations between District Council 9 and its many locals. Disagreements often reflect the three major factions in the union, the Progressives, the Rank-and-File, and the reform platform organized by Frank Schonfeld.</p>
            <p>Series XI, Rank-and-File Groups, includes materials from various rank-and-file groups, mostly reflecting efforts spearheaded by Schonfeld.</p>
            <p>Series XII, California Painters Records, includes documentation on Dow Wilson's leadership in Painters Local 4; the strike conducted by him; the campaign against him; the murders and subsequent resolutions in tribute to him; as well as correspondence between Schonfeld and Wilson, and their mutual attempts to interest the leadership of the Painters Union and the AFL-CIO in a clean-up campaign.</p>
            <p>Series XIII, Clippings, contains articles related to activities within the District Council.</p>
            <p>Series XIV, By-Laws, includes materials related campaigns to reform or amend District By-Laws; and various proposals to solidify autocracy or institute democratic reforms.</p>
            <p>Series XV, Referenda, includes materials related to major fights within District Council 9, including a campaign to establish a Painters Section, Autonomous Locals, and attempts to reorganize the union.</p>
            <p>Series XVI, Collective Bargaining Agreements, includes agreements and proposed agreements; materials on negotiations (limited); and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Agreement that became the source of much contention.</p>
            <p>Series XVII, Strikes and Work Stoppages, includes materials on anti-member activities within the union. Examples include documents on the Paperhangers Local 490 strike, wherein the District Council asserted, "There is no strike," and encouraged the membership to cross Local 490's picket lines; and the Woodfinishers Strike opposing the corrupt bargaining efforts of leadership.</p>
            <p>Series XVIII, Proceedings, includes conference and convention proceedings of the New York State Conference of Painters, and of the International Brotherhood of Painters.</p>
            <p>Series XIX, Publications and Ephemera, includes standard items issued by the union, both NYC and the International, as well as background material on issues documented in other series in this collection, such as the Maintenance Mechanics (see also the Inter-Local Caucus Election Materials); and various materials from the Schonfeld administration. A historically significant document in this series is the 1909 statement on an injunction.</p>
