<p>At the time of accessioning, materials were moved into archival housing and a collection-level finding aid was created to describe these materials. No physical processing or arrangement was done at this time. In the event of refoldering, original caption information, when available, was transcribed onto new folders. Born-digital items including CDs, DVDs and floppy disks were identified and imaged. </p><p>New materials donated in 2017 were described at the time of accessioning and at the box level. Materials were previously housed in labeled envelopes. Loose-leaf documents were placed in folders and given captions based on the envelope container they arrived in. Items housed in folders were kept in their original folders. These materials are in the order in which they were received by the donor.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
<p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>  </phystech>
