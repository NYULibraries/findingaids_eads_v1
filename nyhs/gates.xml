            <p>The collection documents Horatio Gates' military career. The papers include extensive correspondence with British and American military figures, merchants and politicians, e.g. Benedict Arnold, John Burgoyne, Ezekiel Cornell, Richard Curson, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, Henry Laurens, Robert Monckton, Philip Schuyler, Jonathan Trumbull, George Washington and others. The collection contains the Articles of Convention, which defined the terms of British surrender at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. The collection also contains an exchange of letters between Marquis de Lafayette and Baron von Steuben, as well as drafts of Gates’ speeches to Native American leaders. Also included are financial documents, account books, cashbooks, orderly books and Gates’ journal, which details a British expedition to Nova Scotia in 1750. In addition to his military career, a glimpse of Gates’ personal life can be seen in correspondence with family members, including his first and second wives, Elizabeth and Mary, and his son, Robert.</p>

            <p>Horatio Gates’ wife, Mary Vallance Gates, died in 1810. In the wake of her death, Joel Barlow inherited the papers of Horatio Gates. Barlow, a poet and politician, had intended to write a history of the American Revolution. However in 1811, President James Madison sent Barlow on a diplomatic mission to France. Robert Fulton, a friend of Barlow’s, received the Gates papers on Barlow’s behalf. Barlow died in Poland in 1813 and his work on the American Revolution was never completed. In 1814, Barlow’s wife donated the Gates papers to the New-York Historical Society (N-YHS). At the time, the papers were stored in a trunk in Fulton’s home. The papers arrived at N-YHS in 1816 and were arranged by John Pintard, a founder of N-YHS.</p>

            <p>In 1975, N-YHS received a grant from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC) to microfilm the Gates papers. At the time, a search for additional materials related to Gates was conducted in various American and British libraries, in addition to other N-YHS collections. Relevant documents were submitted from over seventy institutions and as a result, the microfilm edition available at N-YHS includes both the original Gates papers, as well as the items loaned from other repositories. In 1979, the Microfilming Corporation of America, with sponsorship from N-YHS and NHPRC, published

                    <p>The orderly books record the orders and movements of the British Army prior to the war, and the Continental Army during the war. The returns document the quantity, rank and physical condition of soldiers in various British and Continental regiments. This series includes an orderly book kept at Oneida Station, New York (later Fort Stanwix) in 1758; an orderly book recorded during the march from Carlisle to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1759; and Gates' journal from an expedition to Nova Scotia in 1750.</p>
