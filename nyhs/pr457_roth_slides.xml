    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Roth's slides of Macy's 1951 Thanksgiving Day Parade show the balloons "Toy Soldier," "Rainbow Trout," "Mighty Mouse" (debuted 1951), "Dachshund," and "Hobo Clown." His slides of the 1952 parade show the balloons "Crocodile," "Mighty Mouse," "The Spaceman" (debuted 1952), "Rainbow Trout," and "Teddy Bear," as well as the floats "American Eagle," "Mississippi River Showboat," "Chiquita Banana's Tropical Garden" (sole appearance), "Noah's Ark," "Sonny the Bunny," "The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T" (sole appearance; advertisement for an upcoming musical film), "The Spaceship" (debuted 1952), "Calliope Circus," and "Santa's Sleigh." Roth's night views of the neon lights of Times Square were likely taken in 1958, based on the presence of advertisements for "A Night to Remember" and "The Big Country," two films which premiered that year. Other signs advertise "Pepsi Cola," "TWA," and "Time-Life," and two views show store windows displaying Halloween candy and popular record albums.</p>  </scopecontent>
