            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Philip Burnett Franklin Agee (July 19, 1935–January 7, 2008) was a United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case officer and writer. He is best known as the author of 
                <emph render="italic">Inside the Company: CIA Diary</emph> (1975), first published in Britain because of legal problems in the U.S., which identifed about 250 officers, front companies and foreign agents working for or cooperating with the United States. Agee joined the CIA in 1957, and over the following decade had postings in Washington, D.C., Ecuador, Uruguay, and Mexico. After resigning from the Agency in 1968, he became a leading opponent of CIA practices. Agee also wrote 
                <emph render="italic">Dirty Work: The CIA in Western Europe</emph> (1978), 
                <emph render="italic">Dirty Work: The CIA in Africa</emph> (1979), and a biography, 
                <emph render="italic">On the Run</emph> (1987). Agee's work inspired the founding of the 
                <emph render="italic">Covert Action Information Bulletin</emph>, for which he also wrote. He was exiled from the U.S., for revealing classified information, via the revocation of his passport by the U.S. Department of State in 1979 while he was abroad (upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1989). He was also pressured to leave Great Britain in 1977. He lectured throughout Western and Eastern Europe. Agee was also eventually expelled from Holland, France, West Germany, and Italy, and died in Cuba in January, 2008.</p>
            <p>Agee was involved in several legal cases. Agee sued the United States Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Security Agency, Department of State, and Department of Justice, seeking to obtain government documents under the Freedom of Information Act, and obtained numerous documents as a result of these complex legal proceedings that related to his former CIA employment, and to his investigative and writing activities. Agee also sued Barbara Bush,alleging that, in her 
                <emph render="italic">Barbara Bush: Memoir</emph> (Scribner, 1994) she had falsely held him responsible for the death of Athens CIA Station Chief Richard Welch, assassinated in 1975. Agee also sued George Crile, Gust Avrakotos, Grove/Atlantic, the Atlantic Monthly Press, and Publishers Group West, claiming that Crile's book 
                <emph render="italic">Charlie Wilson's War</emph> (Grove/Atlantic, 2003) falsely held him responsible for the death of Richard Welch.</p>

            <p>The collection contains: biographical materials, photographs, correspondence, detailed datebooks; (U.S.) government documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) -- principally CIA documents, as well as FBI and State Department documents; legal materials from various cases in which Agee was the plaintiff; lectures and university teaching files; subject files, many relating to Latin American and other countries and to the CIA's activities in relation to them, and some relating to his expulsion from Great Britain; writings by and about Agee; with clippings and clippings files throughout. The leading correspondent is Agee's attorney, Meliv L. Wulf; there is also correspondence with several publishers, with Noam Chomsky, Maurice Bishop, (revolutionary Prime Minister of Grenada from 1979-1983), Ilona Maria Lorenz (Fidel Castro's onetime lover, later hired by CIA to assassinate Castro), and publisher Lyle Stuart. The collection, in addition to documenting Agee's life, his career as a CIA agent and his subsequent activities to expose and oppose U.S. foreign intelligence activities and foreign policy goals, and legal cases in which he was involved, will also be of interest to the study of U.S. foreign intelligence activities and foreign policy, notably in relation to Latin America but also in Western Europe and elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@library.nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information</p>

                    <p>Series IV, Government Documents (1950-1989), contains materials obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the largest number from the CIA, but also including documents from the Department of State (individual files on countries around the world, including several on Great Britain), the Department of Justice, and the FBI, and several small files from other agencies. The CIA files and Department of Justice files include, in addition to files requested by Agee about various activities of these agencies, also include files about Agee, and about the contested nature of the FOIA process. The FBI files are principally lists of deleted materials, i.e., materials not released, but there is also a list of released documents and well as some documents themselves.</p>

                    <p>Series V, Legal Cases and Documents, documents five lawsuits in which Agee was the plaintiff, and also contains a selection of legal documents from and correspondence with Agee's attornerys regarding other cases that were of interest to Agee. The majority of the series consists of affadavits and other legal documents from Agee's suit v. the United States Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Security Agency, Department of State, and Department of Justice, seeking to obtain government documents under the Freedom of Information Act. There are a small number of files, chiefly legal correspondence, but with some legal documents, from two lawsuits in which Agee sought damages for allegedly being falsely accused of being responsible for the 1975 death of Athens, Greece CIA Station Chief Richard Welch. In this regard, Agee separately sued former First Lady Barbara Bush, charging that her 
                        <emph render="italic">Barbara Bush: A Memoir</emph> (1994) falsely made this claim. Agee also sued author George Crile, et al, on the same grounds re his book 
                        <emph render="italic">Charlie Wilson's War</emph> (Grove/Atlantic, 2003). Bush agreed to alter one paragraph in her book as per a 1997 settlement. For the Crile case a similar settlement was reached in 2004. From Agee's unsuccessful attempt to regain his passport by suing the Department of State are several files of clippings, correspondence, and legal documents. There is also one file of plaintiff's affadavits from the case Philip Agee v. United States of America: Civil Action No. 94-2020-WBB, To Recover Damages for Illegal and Tortious Acts Committed against the Plaintiff by the CIA.</p>
