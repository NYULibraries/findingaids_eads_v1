        <eventgrp>
          <event>Because it is harder to obtain English copper during the Napoleonic Wars due to embargoes, duties, and travelling difficulties, the demand from American shipbuilders and craftsmen, prospering during the war, increases. Harmon becomes more interested in the manufacture of American copper, especially with the outbreak of the War of 1812. Works with Paul Revere, Robert Fulton, and other American merchants and manufacturers to find solutions for the shortage and produce quality copper. </event>

<p>The Hendricks Family Papers consist of material relating to the Hendricks family, pioneers in the American copper industry and prominent members of the Sephardic Jewish community in New York. The material spans over 250 years, beginning with the import trade of Uriah Hendricks (1737-1798) and his son Harmon (1771-1838), continuing with the manufacture of copper at the mill begun by Harmon at Belleville, New Jersey, and carried on by their descendants under the name Hendricks Brothers. It contains both business and family papers, including loose correspondence and business records, ledgers and account books, letterbooks, indentures, mortgages, deeds, maps, blueprints, journals, scrapbooks, photographs, memorabilia, and ephemera. Among later additions to the collection is the correspondence of Henry Solomon Hendricks (1892-1959), president (parnas) of Congregation Shearith Israel, which highlights the day-to-day operations of the oldest synagogue in the United States for the period 1927-1951. Henry Solomon Hendricks married a cousin, Rosalie Gomez Nathan (1894-1986), and through her the collection extends to papers of various interrelations, among them the Gomez, Hays, Levy, Seixas, Solis, and Nathan families.</p>  </scopecontent>

His father, Aaron Hendricks, was a prominent London merchant with connections both in England and the colonies. Through his connections, and his own good business sense, Uriah was able to expand fairly quickly from a small-time dry goods shopkeeper to a successful merchant importer involved in the carrying trade with England and the West Indies. On the road to making his fortune, Uriah married Eve Esther Gomez, daughter of a second-generation colonial, in 1762. Together the couple had eleven children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. Uriah took an active role in the Jewish community in New York. He was a member and President of synagogue Shearith Israel and a regular contributor to charity and cemetery funds. A devoted father, he made certain his children learned Hebrew and received a proper Jewish education. He was a fixture in the economic life of the city as well, becoming one of the richest merchants in New York while still a young man. Wishing to maintain the safety of his family and his business, Uriah was not as active in the political life of the city or the country, but did profit by supplying the military during both the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref35_7g0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letterbook</unittitle><unitdate normal="1758/1759" type="inclusive">1758-1759</unitdate><container id="aspace_577c9a8ca83edae4467cc543d3065879" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_577c9a8ca83edae4467cc543d3065879" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref36_rfu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence and records</unittitle><unitdate normal="1758/1782" type="inclusive">1758-1782</unitdate><container id="aspace_d2aff6e21ba6d4172dc69c320c8997c2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_d2aff6e21ba6d4172dc69c320c8997c2" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref37_7bu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Marriage contracts </unittitle><unitdate>1763, 1787</unitdate><container id="aspace_9b7ffb0962824a547c02a572df6a0a90" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_9b7ffb0962824a547c02a572df6a0a90" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref38_ufn" level="file"><did><unittitle>Diary fragment relating to estate of father, Aaron Hendricks	</unittitle><unitdate normal="1771/1771" type="inclusive">1771</unitdate><container id="aspace_1e9e999c6d8f3527badb345feb30c125" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_1e9e999c6d8f3527badb345feb30c125" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref39_73b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence and business records</unittitle><unitdate normal="1790/1798" type="inclusive">1790-1798</unitdate><container id="aspace_ce34f3f9ffc1a9108befb72536f616ae" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_ce34f3f9ffc1a9108befb72536f616ae" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref40_eo2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Receipt book</unittitle><unitdate normal="1792/1831" type="inclusive">1792-1831</unitdate><container id="aspace_73831b8dafc274ec12d8534d6a5cd9e9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_73831b8dafc274ec12d8534d6a5cd9e9" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref41_xav" level="file"><did><unittitle>Account book</unittitle><unitdate normal="1795/1803" type="inclusive">1795-1803</unitdate><container id="aspace_cbf7e43ba6d285a32d516363d5ea490f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_cbf7e43ba6d285a32d516363d5ea490f" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref42_ld3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letterbook 1797-1801</unittitle><unitdate normal="1797/1801" type="inclusive">1797-1801</unitdate><container id="aspace_9cc2ecd545ed45e530fb9a18e080e5bd" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_9cc2ecd545ed45e530fb9a18e080e5bd" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref43_svf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Claims for release on estate 1798-1801</unittitle><unitdate normal="1798/1801" type="inclusive">1798-1801</unitdate><container id="aspace_bb28997b777dc7f7733121355b1d91e6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_bb28997b777dc7f7733121355b1d91e6" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref44_6gp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Letter/invoice</unittitle><unitdate>1791 November 24</unitdate><container id="aspace_f50e8d731f003e6d15b9d4db1244fbeb" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">OS Small</container><container parent="aspace_f50e8d731f003e6d15b9d4db1244fbeb" type="Folder">Y-Hendricks 1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref45_4t4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ledger</unittitle><unitdate normal="1797/1799" type="inclusive">1797-1799</unitdate><container id="aspace_e5c9d4a62471a75b7cad276665c5bbc3" label="Books" type="Volume">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref46_14o" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ledger fragments and index</unittitle><unitdate normal="1797/1813" type="inclusive">1797-1813</unitdate><container id="aspace_cec868c20178effd236c67a52c6f7885" label="Books" type="Volume">2</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref2_g5g" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series II.

It is arguably the most historically important of the collection and  one of the richest pertaining to a New York merchant in the carrying trade who subsequently helped to build one of America's basic industries.

Harmon was especially interested in the metals trade in which Uriah had recently become involved. After Uriah's death six years later, Harmon took over completely, discontinuing the West Indian trade to focus exclusively on the carrying trade with England and trade in America, particularly in copper and other metals.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_6d44e99223682ac781d8e6bf2397dab5"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The business correspondence is ordered chronologically and then by person or subject.

It also contains genealogical research and notes, charts, stamps, coats-of-arms, and other background information.</p><p>The records describe the Hendricks family's involvement in the social, religious, and economic life of the city. Member of the Hendricks family were leaders of synagogue Shearith Israel, the Jewish Benevolent Society, and the American Jewish Historical Society. Members of several related families, such as Edwin Einstein, husband of Uriah Hendricks's daughter Fanny and candidate for mayor in the early 1900s, became involved in political life. Given the extent of intermarriage with other prominent New York Jewish families and the Hendricks's position as community leaders, the material in this series contains a wealth of information on the New York Jewish community and New York society in general, from the late eighteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries.</p><p>For additional material, see <ref ns2:target="ref334">Series IX.
