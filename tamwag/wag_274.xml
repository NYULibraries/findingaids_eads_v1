    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The American Communications Association (ACA) was formed in 1931 as the American Radio Telegraphists Association, a union representing telegraphists and radio operators. In 1938 the Communist-dominated union affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations. During the 1940s, leaders of the ACA refused to sign the anti-communist affidavits required under the Taft-Hartley Act, claiming the oaths violated their First Amendment rights. The ACA sued is response to this provision of the Taft-Hartley Act, and in 1950 the United States Supreme Court ruled that the imposition of an anti-communist oath on labor union leaders does not violate the First Amendment.</p>  </bioghist>
