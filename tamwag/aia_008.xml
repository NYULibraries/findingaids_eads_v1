            <abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract">Frank Durkan (1930-2006) was a New York-based Irish American attorney active in legal cases and human rights issues related to Northern Ireland. He was a central player on the U.S. end of the Northern Ireland Peace Process, particularly in his role as Chairman of the political pressure group Americans for a New Irish Agenda (ANIA). The papers reflect those activities, including the granting of a visa to Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams in 1994, the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and decommissioning efforts down to 2002 document his work as an attorney with O'Dwyer &amp; Bernstien law firm in New York. Durkan was widely consulted on deportation and extradition cases involving Irish Americans living in the United States and the collection documents the defense efforts mounted on behalf of his clients, particularly between 1991 and 2001. The collection also contains material of a personal nature on topics of interest to Durkan, including the Great Famine in Ireland, shipwrecks of Irish coming to the Americas, his membership and activities in the Irish History Roundtable and a collection of his books, legal, history and sports-related. A small amount of audio visual material completes the collection.</abstract>

            <p>This collection document the professional work and social and organizational activities of Frank Durkan. Durkan was a lawyer in the firm O’Dwyer &amp; Bernstien and the materials in the collection contain papers from significant cases in his career, including Desmond Mackin, George Harrison, and the Brooklyn Five. His membership and involvement in organizations such as Americans for a New Irish Agenda (ANIA) and the Behon Law Society, as well as other activist organizations focused on conflict in Northern Ireland are also present. Durkan was also widely consulted on deportation and extradition cases involving Irish Americans living in the United States; his collection illustrates the defense efforts mounted on behalf of dozens of men in this situation, particularly between 1991 and 2001.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Frank Durkan (1930-2006), a native of Co. Mayo, was a New York-based Irish American attorney active in legal cases and human rights issues related to Northern Ireland. He was a central player on the U.S. end of the Northern Ireland Peace Process, particularly in his role as Chairman of the political pressure group Americans for a New Irish Agenda (ANIA). In addition, Durkan was widely consulted on deportation and extradition cases involving Irish Americans living in the United States; his papers document the defense efforts mounted on behalf of dozens of men, particularly between 1991 and 2001.</p>
            <p>Francis Patrick Durkan was born in Bohola, Co. Mayo, Ireland on 13 August 1930, the second son of Bernard Durkan, a teacher, and Mary Rose O’Dwyer. He was educated at St. Nathy’s in Ballaghadereen, Co. Mayo until emigrating (at age 17) to New York City in 1947, where two of his maternal uncles William and Paul O’Dwyer were already prominent members of municipal government and legal circles. Durkan earned his bachelor’s degree from Columbia University in 1951 followed by a law degree from New York Law School in 1953. He worked for the family firm of O’Dwyer &amp; Bernstien, starting as a clerk and rising to senior partner. During his distinguished law career, he represented cases of injury, negligence, and malpractice but became best known for his work defending Irish Americans in civil rights matters related to the conflict in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p>He succeeded in preventing the extradition of Desmond Mackin in 1981 – that decision is a landmark in the field of Extradition Law – and successfully defended the Fort Worth Five in 1973 and George Harrison in 1982 against charges of gun-running for the Provisional IRA. He was also consulted on several other important deportation, extradition, and Irish prisoner cases that followed the Harrison trial, including Joe Doherty who was represented by Steve Sommerstein and Mary Pike between 1982-1992.</p>
            <p>Frank Durkan cut his socio-political eye-teeth at the elbow of his uncle Paul O’Dwyer, a towering figure in the Mayo Society of New York, the United Irish Counties Association, the American League for an Undivided Ireland, and the Irish Institute. Paul O’Dwyer (1907-1998) was also President of the New York City Council (1974-1977). His uncle, William O’Dwyer (1890-1964) was mayor of New York City from 1946-1950.</p>
            <p>Durkan was known and respected across a spectrum of the New York Irish community through some of these same organizations. In addition, he was a founding member of the Brehon Law Society of the City of New York (est. 1978) and the Irish American Unity Conference (est. 1983), both dedicated to working towards the extension of human rights in the north of Ireland. In 1992 Durkan helped organize Irish-Americans for Clinton-Gore with Congressman Bruce Morrison (D-CT), the co-sponsor of H.R. 4300 (Immigration Act of 1990), as its first Chairman. After the election of President Bill Clinton, this group became Americans for a New Irish Agenda (ANIA), a less partisan and more inclusive organization that monitored the Clinton Administration’s Irish campaign promises, worked closely with the Ad Hoc Committee for Irish Affairs in Congress, and was a key player in the Northern Ireland peace process. Durkan had been Chairman of ANIA for four years when he was the Mayo Society of New York’s Millennium Honoree and ‘Mayo Man of the Year’ in 2000. The history of the peace process in Northern Ireland, as it has been written since 1998, focused on ‘stars’ like George Mitchell, Jean Kennedy Smith, and William J. Flynn. The intense, behind-the-scenes work of groups like ANIA has been overlooked. The Frank Durkan Papers offer insight into the significant network of key relationships and perseverance in the United States that enabled dialogue to begin and continue in the north of Ireland during the 1990s.</p>
            <p>Frank Durkan died on November 16, 2006 due to complications from a lung infection. He was survived by his wife, Monica Goggin, and daughters Mary Louise and Aisling.</p>

            <head>Processing Information note</head>
            <p>In 2014, an addition to the collection was processed and integrated into the existing series and subseries structure; therefore, the intellectual arrangement and physical arrangement of materials does not always correspond. Part of the collection was heavily damaged by mold and water. These materials were quarantined, appraised, and either destroyed or cleaned. Moldy materials that were published or available from other sources were destroyed. During the arrangement and description of the collection, materials were reviewed for the following circumstances: attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product, and the presence of sensitive, personally identifiable information. Materials that were deemed to fall under these categories have been closed to researchers.</p>
            <p>The collection was rehoused in acid-free folders and boxes, and described by an archivist. Extensive duplicates were discarded if not annotated.</p>

            <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

                        <p>In the 1970s, the newspaper, 
                            <emph render="italic">The Irish People</emph>, was sued by the Attorney General of the United States in an attempt to force the paper to register as a foreign agent. The U.S. Attorney General argued the paper had received monies and donation of space from the Irish Northern Aid Committee, an organization which was suspected of sending monies to fund the activities of the IRA in Northern Ireland. The paper was considered complicit in this enterprise.</p>

                        <p>In 1978, Desmond Mackin was charged with the attempted murder of a British Soldier in Ireland. He fled to the States and was subsequently arrested in 1980 and charged for this crime. In a landmark ruling, the Judge found that Mr. Mackin could not be extradited because his offences were political, i.e., he was a member of an uprising group (the IRA) and his alleged offense was attributed to furthering the aims of this political group and their uprising. After avoiding extradition, the INS initiated deportation proceedings and Mackin elected to be deported to the South of Ireland to avoid risking deportation to British authorities.</p>

                        <p>George Harrison, along with Tom Falvey, Michael Flannery, Patrick Mullin and Danny Gormley, was arrested and tried for illegal shipment of arms to Northern Ireland. The case hinged on the fact that Harrison and his co-conspirators believed that their contact, George DeMeo, was himself an agent of the CIA and therefore the United States government was cognizant of their arms dealing and complicit in allowing this activity to continue.</p>
                        <p>The files contain the trail transcripts along with many legal documents and newspaper clippings. Of note is the Jury Verdict slip, showing all defendents not guilty on all counts (Box 15, Folder 21).</p>

                        <p>Materials in this subseries relate to the former ruling family of Iran and subsequent legal actions taken by the State of Iran against the family, suing them for their assets. These files relate to the Plaintiff who in this particular lawsuit was Ashraf Pahlavi, twin sister of the late shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.</p>
                        <p>As background, in January 16, 1979, the Shah and his wife, the empress, left Iran to live in exile after the overthrow of government and installation of Ayatollah, Ruhollah Khomeini. The Ayatollah, attempted to seek extradition from any country the Shah would visit or go to and also sought to seize all of the Shah’s assets. The Ayatollah also called for the assassination of the Shan and numerous family members. The Shah came to New York City on Oct 22, 1979 for medical care and this visit led to the Iranian Hostage Crisis. After seeking refuge in other countries, the Shah finally settled in Egypt where he died July 27, 1980. The hostages were not released until January 20, 1981 after an agreement was negotiated, the Algerian Accords.</p>
                        <p>The suit in these files refers to that brought against the royal family by the country of Iran. The case was brought to the attention of O'Dwyer and Bernstien when the Shah came to New York City for medical attention. In the opinion of the lawyers, the Ayatollah was attempting to continue its revolution in the courts of the United States by attempting to take from the Royal Family via judicial process what it could not take by force. Iran was asking the Unites States court to intervene in a political dispute between two ruling regimes in a foreign country: The Khomeini regime and the Pahlavi regime. Brian O'Dwyer argued that New York has no responsibility to provide the type of forum that the Plaintiff - the government of Iran – should be providing and therefore the suit was considered illegitimate.</p>
                        <p>The Princess, Ashraf Pahlavi was known as an advocate of women’s rights and the material documents her frequent travel to other countries promoting women’s rights. She was exiled from Iran in 1951 because of her “political meddling and general objectionable behavior”. She was allowed to return permanently in 1954 (See folder FOI Request Documents, 1946-1959).</p>
