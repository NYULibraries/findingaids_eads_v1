            <p>At the time of accessioning materials were moved into archival housing, series, a file list and a finding aid was created to describe these materials. The original order in which the materials were received by the Tamiment Library has largely been maintained: paper records are arranged in alphabetical order by folder title, and chronologically by year within identical folder titles; videotapes have not been arranged. A link to Soh Daiko's website was added as a third series.</p>

            <p>The collection consists almost entirely of programs, press releases, and clippings documenting Soh Daiko's performances for every year from 1979 through 2014 (with the exception of 1980) and videotapes documenting Soh Daiko performances at the American Museum of Natural History and Japan Society, a joint performance with Kodo (a Japanese 
                <title render="italic">taiko </title>group), Soh Daiko's appearance on a segment of the "Reading Rainbow" program on public television, and the group's visit to Japan in the 1980s. A link with the Soh Daiko website has also been included in the finding aid.</p>

            <p>
                <title render="italic">Taiko</title>, a kind of traditional Japanese drumming used for ritual celebrations and festivals also became a contemporary performing art of mass drumming in the in the 1960s.</p>
            <p>Soh Daiko (which means “peaceful, harmonious drum” in Japanese), founded in New York City in 1979, became the first taiko group on the East Coast. It began as a youth activity by members of the New York Buddhist Church who were inspired by a performance of a Chicago 
                <title render="italic">taiko</title> group at an Eastern Young Buddhist League convention. Organized by membership chairman Mamoru “Mo” Funai and adult advisors Jim Moran, Merle and Alan Okada, they started with a grant from the Church. With this small grant, they learned to make barrel drums and learned basic 
                <title render="italic">taiko</title> techniques with help from 
                <title render="italic">taiko</title> instructors from Chicago and Los Angeles. Within a short time Soh Daiko evolved from a youth group to an adult group.</p>
            <p>With funding from a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Soh Daiko pursued more advanced training from Seiichi Tanaka of San Francisco Taiko Dojo; it also received instruction from from members of the Tachibana Dance Group and members of the Kodo taiko group visiting from Japan. The association with Kodo resulted in joint concert, “Kodo/Soh Daiko: A 
                <title render="italic">Taiko</title> Celebration” at the Japan Society in New York in 1987. Shortly afterwards, Soh Daiko took its first trip to Japan, including a stay with the Kodo group on Sado Island.</p>
            <p>Soh Daiko expanded its repertoire to include traditional compositions from Shinto music tradition, adapting existing 
                <title render="italic">taiko</title> compositions, has drawn inspiration from other world cultures, and performed original arrangements by its own members. More than percussion, Soh Daiko’s performances feature the visual element of movement and choreography, requiring physical strength, endurance, and energy, its musicians playing drums ranging from a little over a foot in diameter to some almost as large as the person playing it. In addition to drums, the group incorporates accessories such as bamboo flutes, brass bells, conch shells, gongs, African 
                <title render="italic">shekere</title> (gourd percussion instrument), and Tahitian 
                <title render="italic">toere</title> (wooden slit drum). The number of performers in Soh Daiko has varied from about 11 to 16 members; the total number of participants since its inception through 2014 is about 75. Its members have had diverse backgrounds and professions, and an equal number of women, if not more, have belonged as well as men. While its makeup has been mainly Asian American, Soh Daiko has included members of other ethnic origins. The group has operated as a collective.</p>
            <p>Soh Daiko has participated in many local New York City cultural festivities such as Brooklyn Botanic Gardens’ Cherry Blossom Festival, Smithsonian’s Folk Life Festival, the annual Asian/Pacific American Heritage Festival, Japan Day Festival in Central Park, and Summerstage and at celebrated venues including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival, the American Museum of Natural History, and Radio City Music Hall. It has also performed across the United States and Puerto Rico, as well as in Canada and United Kingdom. The group has also been featured on public television’s children’s programs Sesame Street and Reading Rainbow, National Public Radio’s "All Things Considered," and with artists such as Korn, Rob Thomas, and Kanye West. It has received critical acclaim from the 
                <title render="italic">New York Times</title>, 
                <title render="italic">Dance Magazine</title>, and the 
                <title render="italic">San Francisco Chronicle</title>. The group’s debut recording, "Soh Daiko," was released by Lyrichord Discs in 2005; a documentary video about the group, 
                <title render="italic">Soh Daiko: Taiko in New York,</title> was produced in 2011, featuring interviews with members past and present, and performance footage.</p>

            <p>The Soh Daiko Archive Records and Videotapes were brought to the Tamiment Library/Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives as a result of the Asian/Pacific American Documentary Heritage Archives Survey, a collaboration between the Library and Archives and New York University’s Asian/Pacific/American Institute, funded by a one-year grant from the Metropolitan New York Library Council. The Survey was the first systematic attempt in the New York metropolitan area to identify available or potential Asian/Pacific American collections of documents with historical value, and it worked with community-based organizations and individuals to survey their records and papers. Once located and surveyed, some of these materials were given to or purchased by the Library or went to other repositories.</p>

            <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>
