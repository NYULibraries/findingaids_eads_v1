<p>In March 2020, University Archivist Janet Bunde selected websites on the NYU response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The collection was maintained by Nicole Greenhouse. Maintenance of the collection consisted of rescoping due to missing captured content, redirects and content drift, missing embedded materials (such as videos or attached Google documents and pdfs), and other materials created by selected entities that is related to the pandemic. The finding aid was created in Spring 2022 and description was standardized across the collection.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In March 2020, non-essential businesses throughout New York City closed in an effort to contain COVID-19, a respiratory virus that was first identified in December 2019. These closures included New York University (NYU) buildings. On March 11, 2020, classes were directed to teach remotely and non-essential employees were directed to work from home. These closures not only affected by the New York campus, but global study away sites and the campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai. In July 2020, the university began planning for a hybrid work and learning. For the Fall 2020 semester, NYU implemented a coronavirus testing program as well as guidance for students related to masking, dorms, cleaning, shared spaces, classrooms, and quarantine and isolation procedures. For staff and faculty, guidance included events, research and laboratories, health information, travel policies, teaching, and research and laboratory procedures. In early 2021, the COVID-19 vaccine became available and NYU held a vaccine clinic toward the end of the Spring 2021 semester. NYU required vaccination for the 2021-2022 academic year. By the Fall 2021 semester, majority of remote learning ended, but with flexibility for students who tested positived for the coronavirus. Throughout the 2021-2022 academic year, the university dealt with both the Delta and Omicron variant surges. As of this writing (June 2022), the NYU still has protocols regarding the virus.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains websites regarding New York University's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes webpages from the University's campuses worldwide that represent advocacy, information, policies, protest, research, and scholarship created by individuals and communities within NYU, including administrators, faculty, students, staff, alumni, and prospective students at the New York campus, study away sites, and the campuses in Shanghai and Abu Dhabi. It reflects decisions made by the University to close its campuses and buildings and to change or cancel the regular operation of the University, including in-person events, instruction, and research, as well as how these decisions were communicated to communities within the University; how communities at the University confronted telework and remote instruction; initiatives across the University to conduct research, publish articles, or otherwise fight the spread of the pandemic or analyze its effects; initiatives to aid students and staff within the community during the crisis; and research and thought around the pandemic with a particular focus on the social sciences. </p><p>As the pandemic continued, websites included information on reopening the campus with health and safety guidance regarding testing, masking, vaccines, social distancing. The website also tracked the spread of infection on campus. As the pandemic continued, the website also contained information related to the Delta and Omicron variant surges.</p>  </scopecontent>
