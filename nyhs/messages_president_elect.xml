    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p><emph render="italic">Messages for the President-Elect</emph> was a special installation at New-York Historical Society inspired by <emph render="italic">Subway Therapy</emph>, which was created by artist Matthew "Levee" Chavez following the 2016 presidential election, in which Donald J. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. From the day after the election until 16 December, Chavez invited passersby at Manhattan's Union Square subway station to express their emotions about the election on sticky notes (e.g., Post-its) and post them to the station wall. When Chavez's work was taken down, about 5,600 of the approximately 20,000 total notes were donated to New-York Historical Society. In connection with the donation and in light of the continuing public discussion about the election in advance of Inauguration Day on 17 January 2017, New-York Historical applied Chavez's concept within its own building. On the glass wall at the front entrance of N-YHS's building, facing Central Park West, visitors were invited to write on sticky notes their answer to the question: What's your message for our incoming president? The special installation ran from 20 December 2016 through 22 January 2017.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The artist Matthew "Levee" Chavez donated a portion of his work <emph render="italic">Subway Therapy</emph>, which was the inspiring concept behind <emph render="italic">Messages for the President-Elect</emph>, to New-York Historical. See call number MS 3025.</p><p>Chavez's work inspired similar projects in other parts of the country. One such project was implemented by the third grade of the Brooklyn Friends School.

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The <emph render="italic">Messages for the President-Elect</emph> collection includes about 5,700 sticky notes posted to New-York Historical Society's front glass wall from 20 December 2016-20 January 2017. A small number were added to the collection in early February by a visiting school group. Given the limited space on the glass wall, the posted notes were thinned each day to make room for more, and off-point vulgar/obscene notes were taken down to avoid provoking others in a similar vein. All remaining notes were finally removed/deinstalled from the wall on 23 January. All sticky notes removed from the wall during the course of the installation were retained, except for those that were badly damaged and a set of about 22 notes that included the first name of a person (unknown but  unrelated to the theme of the project), her phone number and derogatory references.</p>  </scopecontent>
