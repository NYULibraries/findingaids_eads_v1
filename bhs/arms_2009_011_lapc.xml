            <head>Historical note</head>
            <p>The Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church (LAPC) was originally organized as the Park Presbyterian Church in the eleventh ward of Brooklyn, New York, in 1857. At first, the church was temporarily based in the former home of the Park Congregation Church on Carlton Avenue, near DeKalb Avenue, in what is today known as the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>
            <p>In 1860, the church invited Rev. Theodore L. Cuyler to become its first pastor. Cuyler, a vocal supporter of the abolitionist movement, was then the pastor of the Market Street Dutch Reformed Church in New York City. Cuyler agreed to accept the call to Brooklyn on the condition that the church purchase land and erect a new church building on the corner of Lafayette Avenue and South Oxford Street. The congregation purchased the land just ten days later, and Cuyler was installed as pastor on April 24, 1860. The church building was completed and dedicated in March 1862, and the congregation was renamed the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church.</p>
            <p>The congregation was greatly expanded under Cuyler, from 140 members in 1860 to over 2,300 in 1890. During this time period the church’s Sabbath School was established, along with a number of church groups, such as the Young People’s Associations, the Cuyler Mission Band, and Women’s Home and Foreign Missionary Society. Several chapels were organized throughout Brooklyn, expanding the reach of the church beyond the Fort Greene neighborhood.</p>
            <p>In 1872, Cuyler caused great controversy by inviting Sarah Smiley, a Quaker preacher, to be the first woman to deliver an address at a Presbyterian service.</p>
            <p>Another major event which occurred during the Cuyler pastorate was the establishment of the Presbyterian mission in Korea, which was spearheaded by LAPC Elder Daniel W. McWilliams.</p>
            <p>Cuyler retired in 1890 after serving 30 years as pastor for the LAPC. The congregation chose Rev. David Gregg, of the Park Street Congregational Church in Boston, as its second pastor. Gregg accepted the call and was installed on December 14, 1890. The church and its chapels continued to expand under his pastorate. Gregg remained at the church until 1903, when he accepted the call to be president of the Western Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
            <p>The third pastor of the LAPC, Rev. Cleland Boyd McAfee, was installed on October 8, 1904. He had previously served as pastor to the 41st Street Presbyterian Church in Chicago, Illinois. McAfee continued the church’s support for missions, both locally and abroad, and was a strong proponent of the church’s music program. A new organ was installed in November 1910. He resigned in June 1912, when he accepted the call to serve as the chair of Systematic Theology at McCormick Seminary in Chicago.</p>
            <p>On May 6, 1913, Rev. Charles Carroll Albertson was installed as the fourth pastor of the LAPC. Albertson led the effort to enlarge the church’s endowment fund during his fifteen year service as minister of the church. He was a leading advocate of the Social Gospel movement in American Protestantism. During his pastorate, the Buckhorn Association was established as a mission in rural Kentucky in 1916. Additionally, a Parish House was built in 1917 to house various community-service projects locally in Brooklyn. He retired on Easter Sunday, 1928.</p>
            <p>Rev. Alvin E. Magary was installed as the fifth pastor of the LAPC on May 6, 1930. He led the church through a difficult period, as noted in the LAPC’s One Hundredth Anniversary booklet, “with the depression, the war years and the confused times of the post-war period, Brooklyn changed in character far more than our immediate neighborhood. Older members of church families retired and moved away or were taken by death. Younger members of these families moved out of the neighborhood or city.” Magary remained pastor for 26 years, retiring in 1956.</p>
            <p>The sixth pastor of the LAPC, Rev. George Litch Knight, was installed on December 29, 1957. That year marked the 100th anniversary of the church. The congregation had shrunk dramatically in the previous years, from a height of 2,500 at the turn of the century to less than 100 in 1960. Knight guided the church through another period of change. He led the effort to rehabilitate the church building and oversaw the development of the church’s Cultural Crossroads program in the 1970s. The church also catered to newly arrived ethnic populations, such as the “Spanish” congregation, led by Rev. Moises J. Senti, and the Korean congregation, led by Elder Chung H. Ro, Rev. John Y. Paik, and Rev. Sung Kook Shin.</p>
            <p>Rev. Knight retired in 1989 after leading the church for over thirty years. He was succeeded by Rev. David W. Dyson, who was chosen as pastor in 1992. Dyson was ordained in 1972, and spent much of the 1970s and 1980s as a labor advocate, first for the United Farm Workers and then for the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. Prior to coming to the LAPC, he served for two years as executive minister for the Riverside Church in Manhattan. He served as LAPC pastor for eighteen years, where his ministry focused on social justice, retiring in 2011.</p>
            <p>As of October 2015, the LAPC is led by Interim Pastor Lindsay Borden.</p>

                    <p>Church Bulletins consist of weekly "orders of services" and notifications concerning upcoming events and organizational meetings held at the church and locally, new members, deaths, requests for donations to various charities, and other matters of interest to LAPC congregants. This series contains bulletins dating from 1882 to 2003. This not a complete collection of LAPC bulletins; there are many gaps in the series, especially for the years prior to 1930 and after 1990. Early bulletins which do not appear in this series are likely to be found in Series 4: Scrapbooks.</p>
                    <p>Beginning in the 1970s, many of these announcements concern art exhibitions, music programs, and other cultural events held at LAPC. The series includes the programs, flyers, and other matter related to these events, including in the late 1970s and later, material regarding the performances, exhibitions, and other programs sponsored at LAPC by Cultural Crossroads, Inc.</p>
                    <p>Included in this series are bulletins for special events, such as pastor installations and anniversaries, wedding and memorial services for church members, Children's Day, concerts, and building and organ dedications.</p>
                    <p>Programs for concert and choir performances are especially well represented in the years 1882 to 1903.</p>
                    <p>The series includes one folder of memorial service bulletins and programs dating from 1960 to 1976.</p>
                    <p>Beginning in the mid-1970s, the series includes some parish newsletters which were filed with the church bulletins.</p>

                        <p>The sub-series contains material related to Rev. Thedore L. Cuyler, most of which documents his time as pastor at the LAPC. It includes sermons (handwritten and published, 1852-1900s), correspondence (1854-1908), four bibles (1826-1890), portraits (circa 1850s-1900s), clippings (1867-1978), anniversary and retirement service programs (1885-1890), and published addresses delivered by Cuyler (1890-1896).</p>
                        <p>Material related to his mother, wife, daughter, son, and grandson can also be found in the series. Addtionally, it contains some biographical materials related to Cuyler, as well as typescripts of a portion of his correspondence.</p>
                        <p>There are several items of note in the series, including: an 1826 bible (in two volumes), presented to Culyer by his father; his mother's diary (1831-1834); an 1842 broadside advertising a temperance lecture delivered by Cuyler at the Canon Street Chapel (England); a collection of scrapbook pages which include poetry authored by Cuyler, abolitionist writings, and a list of his colleagues at Princeton University (1837-1842); and a handwritten sermon on Abraham Lincoln delivered shortly after his assasination (1865).</p>

                        <p>The sub-series contains three volumes of bound, handwritten sermons by Gregg. These pre-date his time at the LAPC, dating from 1872 to around 1884. Also included are two folders of published sermons (circa 1890-1911), documents related to this call to the LAPC (1890), a program for a lecture entitled "The Consecration of Music to the Service of Religion" (1893), a poem written by LAPC Elder A.G. Van Cleve in honor of Gregg departing the LAPC (1904), and a letter from Gregg to John R. Sager (1917).</p>
                        <p>A letter from Gregg to then-current pastor Cleland B. McAfee regarding the church's music and new organ is housed in the Music and organ series (1910).</p>

                    <p>The series contains historical material which had been collected by the church, dating from 1858 to 2004. One item of note is the certificate of incorporation of the Park Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn (1858). Other subjects include the Cumberland Street Church (1897-1905), the Olivet Presbyterian Church (1901-1941), the Gregg Chapel (1916-1933), church attendance (1931-1950), Marianne Moore (1958-1990), and the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn (1970s-1980s). Several church groups are represented in the files, including the Brooklyn City Mission and Tract Society, Cuyler Mission Band, Men's Bible Class, Women's Federation, Young Men's League, and the Young Men's Literary Society.</p>

                    <p>Contains files relating to the LAPC's Ministry of Music, including items related to its organ, its musical director and choir, concerts, and its Cultural Crossroads programs, dating from 1880 to 1995. It includes one file of material on musical director and organist John Hyatt Brewer, which contains his original contract with the church, along material related to celebrations in his honor, photographic portraits, and other documents. Material related to the church's organ includes a contract and correspondence with organ manufacturers Hook and Hastings (1886-1892) and specifications and other documents related to a new organ, which was installed in 1910. A letter from former pastor David Gregg to then-current pastor Cleland B. McAfee regarding the church's music and new organ is included in the series (1910). The series also contains sheet music, including a book of music composed by Dudley Buck and owned by soprano Elizabeth Tudor (1880). Finally, the series includes five scrapbooks containing clippings and programs relating to concerts at the LAPC, as well as other Brooklyn churches and clubs (1870-1895).</p>

                    <p>The series contains files relating to the Sunday School (also referred to as the Sabbath School and the Bible School) at the LAPC, dating from 1865 to 1996. The records include reports, record books, yearbooks, photographs, and teaching materials. The bulk of the series is composed of yearbooks, which document the activities of the Bible School from 1928 to 1950. These yearbooks were assembled by Wallace Dunbar Vincent, a church administrator who was the Bible School secretary during this period.</p>

                    <p>The series contains photographs (primarily prints) dating from the 1890s to 2002.

Pastors Magary and Knight also feature prominently in the series.</p>
                    <p>Please note that additional photographs can be found throughout the collection, and are typically filed with other documents which are thematically related. For instance,
