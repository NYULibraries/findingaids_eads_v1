    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>In 1928, New-York Historical Society's Act of Incorporation was amended by the state legislature to recognize the organization's mission as including "educational purposes." This had important tax advantages, but it also reflected the vision of the chief executive officer at the time, Librarian Alexander J. Wall, to expand public access to N-YHS's resources. Presentations on historical topics, public access to the galleries and even school tours had long been a feature of N-YHS's programs, but financial constraints limited these. In the late 1930s, with the receipt of the large Thompson bequest, the renovation and expansion of the Central Park West building, and the hiring of a small staff to direct educational programs, the programs could, and did, expand, even to include concerts and films, among other initiatives.</p><p>Librarian Wall died in 1944, but his son, Alexander J. Wall, Jr., became N-YHS's Head of Education and Public Relations in 1946 when he returned from the military at the close of World War II. With the exception of the 1950s, this connection between programs and public relations continued until educational programs were cutback in the early 1980s in the face of financial difficulties. This cutback was short-lived, and in 1983 N-YHS hired Carole Slatkin as Director of Public Programs. Over the course of the next several years, programming would expand aggressively in quantity and in N-YHS's willingness to move in new, even provocative, directions. It is this period from about 1984 through 1992 that is the principal focus of the current content of the public programs and education record group. </p><p>Carole Slatkin remained Director of Public Programs until about 1989 when she was replaced by Rae Alexander-Minter. Slatkin continued to work on program-related projects until she left N-YHS. Stephanie Starr worked as an Associate for Public Programs in the 1980s, replaced when she left N-YHS about 1989 by Erika Sanger. Judith M. Giuriceo became an Associate for School Programs about 1990. Jane Lattes was the docent/volunteer coordinator until about 1989 when Marion Galison took that role. Alisa Aydin was an administrative assistant in the unit around 1990. All these individuals, in their active management of programming activities, appear in the documents of the record group. In January 1993, at the height of N-YHS's fiscal crisis, the galleries closed to the public, bringing an end to the program staff and explaining the clear break in the records here. The galleries re-opened in mid-1995 with a renewed emphasis on education and public programs, one that has greatly developed well beyond even the significant initiatives of the late 1980s-1990s.</p><p>Following is some background on certain unique initiatives for which there is extensive documentation in the record group: </p><p><emph render="italic">Summer Institute:</emph> This teacher workshop was conducted for three summers (1987-1989). Centered on the theme "Teaching the Constitution," the workshop accepted about fifteen educators each year from public and private schools of various grades to participate in three weeks of readings, lectures, and discussions. Each teacher developed a lesson plan as a final project based on knowledge gained during the workshop and using N-YHS's library resources. The program was overseen by Carole Slatkin, though directed by Gail Sussman Marcus, who was hired specifically to focus on the Institute's development and implementation. </p><p><emph render="italic">U.S. Constitution Programs:</emph> The Summer Institute used the Constitution as its organizing focus at least in part because 1987 was the Constitution's bicentennial. N-YHS engaged in several educational programs drawing on this anniversary and the associated exhibition it mounted, <emph render="italic">Government by Choice: Inventing the Constitution</emph>. Among these programs were <emph render="italic">U.S. Constitution on the Air</emph> (a series of radio programs and related curriculum guide) and a set of teacher programs called The Bicentennial Connection. These initiatives were done in partnership with others, including a New York City educational program called Impact II, and with funding from the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution.</p><p><emph render="italic">Why History?:</emph> This series of programs started in 1990 as an initiative to examine the meaning of history and its relationship to contemporary issues in America. It attempted to thematically link multiple events across three program components: panel discussions, film series, and music presentations. The 1991 series added a sub-theme: <emph render="italic">Why History? Race and Class</emph>. 1992's sub-theme was: <emph render="italic">Why History? What is American?</emph>  </p><p><emph render="italic">New York Tapes:</emph> This was a pilot program, or prototype, conducted in August 1990, that videotaped New Yorkers at various places in the city, telling personal stories. It was produced by video artist Wendy Clarke and directed by Gary Glassman in conjunction with N-YHS, with funding by the DeWitt
Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. </p><p><emph render="italic">Lab School Programs:</emph> This arts-in-education program was begun in 1991 as a collaboration between N-YHS and the William J. O'Shea Junior High School, or IS 44, using the Luman Reed Gallery as its centerpiece. In 1992, a second project was started, initially to study local history, but eventually to focus on Seneca Village. In addition to IS 44, collaborations included Central Park East Secondary School and the Trinity School.</p><p><emph render="italic">Liberty Scholars Program:</emph> This was begun in October 1990, funded by the State Education Department as part of the Governor's Liberty Partnerships Program concerning at-risk students. Conducted in collaboration with Bank Street College, the program included eight Saturday sessions during which the students visited N-YHS to tour, meet professionals, learn about the various operations of libraries and museums, and to work on a local history project. </p><p><emph render="italic">Returning the Gift:</emph> This project included various activities in order that North American Native writers might share their work. N-YHS was one of four outreach sites.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The New-York Historical Society public programs and education records include files related to the creation, publicity, outreach, funding, management, and implementation of NYHS's programs, principally for the years 1984-1992. Regular programming included, among other things, panel discussions, lectures, concerts, films, and museum gallery tours. The programs also included school age education programs, such as tours for schoolchildren and teacher/educator workshops, as well as special collaborations such as arts-in-education classes or programs for at-risk students. The record group includes documents such as correspondence, plans, scripts, background information for docents, evaluations, statistical reports (e.g., attendance), logistical arrangements (e.g., group reservations, docent scheduling, expenses), classroom teacher resources, brochures, funding requests, and more. Special programs well-documented in the record group are, among others,  the array of activities conducted by N-YHS in connection with the 1987 bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution and the <emph render="italic">Why History?</emph> series (1990-1992) that sought to explore historical themes in direct relation to present day concerns. The record group also holds the reference files of John B. Snook, a docent at N-YHS from 1995-2004.</p>  </scopecontent>

See the Historical Note above for further description of some of the specific programs well-represented in the series.</p><p>The series appears to be, in general, a compilation of records from at least seven individuals: Directors of Public Programs Carole Slatkin (1984-1989) and Rae Alexander-Minter (1989-1993), Associates for Public Programs Stephanie Starr (until about 1989) and Erika Sanger (about 1989-1993), Associate for School Programs Judith M. Giuriceo (started about 1990), and docent/volunteer coordinators Jane Lattes (until about 1989) and Marion Galison (1989-1993). The series includes program descriptions, planning documents, correspondence and memos, publicity, attendance counts, logistical records (e.g., group reservation forms, docent schedules), program evaluations, curriculum or presentation materials for school groups, background texts and some training or informational content for docents. The specific programs covered are wide-ranging and further detail on scope and content at the box level is given below in the container list.</p><p>Although the bulk of the series includes documents from 1984-1992, there is a small amount of earlier program material, principally publicity-related; this is noted in the container list.

Some of these resources were prepared as teaching aids that tied-in to particular exhibitions that students would be exposed to. Most were prepared to teach subject areas not necessarily related to specific exhibitions or visits to N-YHS. The earliest resources in the series are in the form of printed manuals. Later resources are larger sets of material that include digital media, oversize reproductions, and other content in addition to print matter. The series holds material found as standalone items in the N-YHS archives as of 2016; it is unlikely that this includes all such resources prepared by N-YHS's Education Department.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f74810cbf7addb4e7277acb4ceeeadc2"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The series is arranged in chronological order.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref87_qci" level="file"><did><unittitle>America in Art.

Snook (1927-2007), who was a docent at N-YHS beginning in 1995. During the course of his career he had been a professor at Barnard, a pastoral counselor, and director of financial aid at Columbia Law School. This series includes Snook's files on exhibitions, other programs, and general N-YHS matters in support of his work with public programs. The bulk of the files include baseline information about exhibitions (press packets, fliers, labels, wall text, clippings, etc.) that are likely found elsewhere in exhibition, public relations, and other record groups. Nonetheless, some files also hold docent-specific memos and guidance that may not be in other files. Further, the files collectively provide insight into the background materials and other resources available to a docent and that could be used to prepare for gallery tours.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_66cc1c1db32ae40155766e05a8f69a3d"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The files were minimally processed at some point, likely circa 2007, and remain in original folders.
