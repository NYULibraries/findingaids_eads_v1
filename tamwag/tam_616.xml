        American-born documentary filmmaker who has been creating films on Cuba and Latin America
        with her husband Ernesto Bravo since the 1980s. Estela and Ernesto Bravo moved to Cuba in
        the early 1960s, and as a result many of Estela's films focus on political and cultural
        relations between the United States and Cuba. The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes
        and film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length features
        and video footage, the collection contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, home
        movies, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage
        in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of
        historical events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; clips from
        Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and
        background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage is primarily recorded on
        U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and
        distribution. This collection has been partially digitized, and only the digitized footage
        is currently accessible to researchers.</abstract>

      <p>This collection is divided into 32 series by documentary film or by record type. The first
        28 series are arranged in alphabetical order by film title. Within each series, materials
        are grouped by genre. Completed documentaries and edited fragments of documentaries are
        listed at the beginning of each series. They are followed by interview footage, transcripts,
        and other papers related to coordinating interviews. These materials are listed in
        alphabetical order by interviewee last name. Interviews are followed by general footage,
        film clips, and papers. In some cases, footage is listed in alphabetical order by title, but
        many of these clips have not been fully arranged.</p>
      <p>Series XXIX: Independent and Unidentified Footage, 1980-1994 contains interviews and
        footage that is not associated with a specific documentary feature or cannot be identified
        with a completed film. This footage is not grouped by genre, and is arranged in alphabetical
        order by title or interviewee last name.</p>
      <p>Materials in Series XXX: Collected Ephemera and Publications are arranged alphabetically by
        title or by general topic. Additional films related to Estela and Ernesto Bravo's personal
        lives are arranged in Series XXXI: Estela and Ernesto Bravo Family Films. Several of these
        films were originally numbered by the donors. Numbered items are listed in sequential order,

      <head>Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Estela Bravo (1933- ) is an American-born documentary filmmaker who has been creating films
        on Cuba and Latin America with her husband Ernesto Bravo since the 1980s. The Bravos moved
        to Cuba in the early 1960s, and as a result many of Estela Bravo's films focus on political
        and cultural relations between the United States and Cuba. Bravo's documentaries have aired
        on television networks including PBS (US), CBC (Canada), Channel 4 (UK) Canal Plus (France),
        and at international film festivals and retrospectives honoring her work.</p>
      <p>Estela Bravo was born on June 8, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York. The youngest of three
        daughters, she was raised in a family of working-class European immigrants. Estela worked
        for the Furriers Union while studying sociology at night at Brooklyn College. In 1953 she
        helped organize a group called Students for a Peaceful World. She attended the 3rd World
        Student Congress in Warsaw, Poland as a representative for the Students for a Peaceful
        World, where she met Ernesto Bravo.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Mario Bravo (1929- ) was born in Argentina on April 7, 1929. Bravo studied medicine
        at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1951, while still a student, he was targeted by the
        state police for his participation in a student strike and tried on charges of organizing
        anti-government student activities. </p>
      <p>Estela and Ernesto Bravo married in January of 1956. They moved to Cuba in 1963 after
        Ernesto was offered a position as a Professor of Biochemistry at the Medical School of the
        University of Havana. In Cuba, Estela Bravo worked at the cultural institution Casa de las
        Américas where she organized programs promoting folk and protest music. She later began
        developing television programs and creating short documentaries based on archival footage,
        which documented notable figures like the Rosenbergs, Malcolm X, and Paul Robeson. Ernesto
        wrote many of the scripts for these short films. Estela Bravo completed her first
        full-length documentary in 1980, <emph render="italic">Those Who Left</emph>, which told the
        story of Cubans who left the island after the 1959 revolution. In addition to his teaching
        career, Ernesto Bravo has worked collaborator with his wife on her many documentary films,
        and has written a number of books, including <emph render="italic">Modern Medicine in
          Cuba</emph> (1995) and <emph render="italic">Development within Underdevelopment: New
          Trends in Cuban Medicine</emph> (1998).</p>
      <p>As of 2016, Estela and Ernesto Bravo continue to make films. In 2014, they were honored in
        South Africa by the Mandela Foundation, they released films about Gabriel García Márquez and
        Commander Juan Almeida, and they updated their 2007 film, <emph render="italic">Who am I?
          The Found Children of Argentina</emph>.</p>

      <head>Processing Information Note</head>
      <p>Upon receipt of this collection, Tamiment Library discovered that many of the videos had
        mold damage or binder hydrolysis. Several tapes have been repaired and digitized, but many
        have yet to receive treatment. The digitization process remains ongoing.</p>
      <p>To facilitate preservation treatment, all tapes were initially inventoried and assigned a
        persistent identifier, which is listed in the finding aid as the "ref" number. These numbers
        are not sequential and are not listed in a specific order. Individual tapes have been
        arranged intellectually by the full-length feature in which they appear. Tapes were
        originally received in boxes containing packing slips that roughly associated footage with
        specific films. Much of this contextual information was lost, however, due to the immediate
        separation of materials for preservation treatment. Information about footage content and
        associated feature film(s) has been reconstructed to the best of the archivist's ability
        through analysis of container annotations, research, and consultation with the donors.
        Footage has been added to the series that best represents the context of its use. Estela
        Bravo frequently reused footage in multiple documentaries, and consequently some footage may
        be duplicated in more than one series.</p>
      <p>Videos were sent for preservation treatment in multiple installments, which resulted in
        several non-sequential box numbers. In 2016, box numbers were updated and listed in
        sequential order. </p>
      <p>Titles of digitized videos have been edited or supplied by the archivist based on the
        content of the recording. Titles of videos that have yet to be digitized have been derived
        from annotations on the individual film containers and associated notes. The descriptions of
        video cassettes that have not yet been digitized often contain phrases in quotation marks.
        These phrases were copied from annotations on the cassette boxes. As digitized versions of
        the videos become available, descriptions are being updated.</p>
      <p>Many of the videos in this collection were undated. The majority of the dates have been
        estimated by the archivist based on release date of the film or the event documented in the
        footage.</p>
      <p>Two additional donations of ephemera, publications, transcripts, and promotional materials
        were donated in 2014 and 2015. Documents associated with specific films were incorporated
        the existing series, while publications and ephemera more generally associated with
        filmmaking and Estela Bravo's career were added as Series XXX: Collected Ephemera and
        Publications. Films reels documenting moments in Estela and Ernesto Bravo's personal lives
        were added as Series XXXI: Estela and Ernesto Bravo Family Films.</p>
      <p>In 2016 videos stored on a hard drive and flash drive were forensically imaged and
        analyzed. Duplicate copies of full-length documentaries were deaccessioned and remaining
        videos were incorporated into series based on the documentaries with which they
        correspond.</p>
      <p>In 2017, a copy of the documentary <emph render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph> was added to
        the collection as Series XXXII: <emph render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph>.</p>
      <p>In 2018, 225 videos were digitized and described at the item-level.</p>
      <p>In 2020, additional recordings were described at the item-level following digitization.</p>
      <p>In June 2021, 164 original tapes that were both digitized and contaminated with mold were
        photographed and deaccessioned.</p>
      <p>In 2022, 247 moldy Betacam and U-matic tapes were returned from a vendor employed to
        decontaminate and transfer them. Of the returned tapes, 10 original tapes were successfully
        transfered; preservation staff photodocumented the carriers, and disposed of them. At the
        same time 75 moldy tapes were decontaminated and sent offsite without being transferred;
        these tapes are in boxes 27, 28, 29, and 32. Further, 124 tapes were not decontaminated but
        preservation staff isolated the tapes from other items by housing them in a polyethylene bag
        with a desiccated board and RH monitor strip and then sent offsite. If this strip indicates
        an RH greater than 50%, contact the Preservation Department immediately. Do not open this
        packaging without contacting the Preservation Department. Isolated tapes are located in
        boxes 1-5 and box 19. The remaining 38 tapes were decontaminated by the vendor, but their
        condition was too poor to be digitized. These tapes were photodocumented and discarded by
        preservation staff. </p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Estela and Ernesto Bravo Film and Video Collection (dates 1959-2014) contains
        interviews, footage, and full-length films from documentaries created by filmmaker Estela
        Bravo between the 1980s and early 2000s. The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes and
        film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length documentaries
        and video footage, the collection also contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence,
        and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage in this
        collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of
        important events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; historical
        clips from Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and
        others; and background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage was primarily
        recorded on U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for
        screening and distribution.</p>
      <p>Many of Bravo's films focus broadly on Cuba after the revolution and its relationship with
        the United States and other countries. Bravo's films address other issues related to Latin
        American politics and culture, exploring topics such as: children abducted during
        Argentina's "Dirty War;" Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship; the assassination of Maurice
        Bishop in Grenada; social and economic problems caused by Latin American debts owed to the
        United States; struggles to end apartheid in South Africa; and a 1984 concert featuring
        Cuban musicians Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes in Buenos Aires.</p>
      <p>The most extensive footage comes from <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph>
        and its follow-up <emph render="italic">Anecdotes about Fidel</emph>. There are more than
        400 video recordings related to these films. Among the highlights of this material are
        interviews with notable individuals including: Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, George
        McGovern, Alice Walker, Harry Belafonte, Philip Agee, Ted Turner, Edward Heath, Jorge
        Risquet, Ricardo Alarcón, Vilma Espín, and Angela Davis. These videos also contain
        interviews with supporters of the anti-Castro movement including counter-revolutionaries
        like Orlando Bosch.</p>
      <p>Other films featured prominently in this collection address the social consequences of
        tensions between the United States and Cuba. These films include <emph render="italic"
          >Americans in Cuba</emph>, documenting American who moved to Cuba after the revolution;
          <emph>The Cuban Excludables</emph>, which follows Cubans who came to the United States
        during the Mariel boatlift and the conditions they faced while being detained by US
        authorities; and <emph render="italic">Miami-Havana</emph>, a film that explores the
        consequences of travel and communication restrictions between Cuba and the United
        States.</p>
      <p>Not all of Bravo's films are represented in the collection. Footage from some films may be
        more complete than others, while footage from other films does not appear in the collection
        at all. In other cases video footage is duplicated in multiple series. Bravo frequently
        reused older footage in follow-up documentaries to provide background and context for a
        subsequent film. For example, footage from the 1985 film, <emph render="italic">Missing
          Children</emph>, also appears in the 2007 documentary, <emph render="italic">Who Am I?:
          The Found Children of Argentina</emph>. Additionally, there are many interviews that
        exceed the duration of a single tape, and are recorded on multiple tapes. These interviews
        will contain pauses and breaks in the conversation to allow the videographer to change
        tapes.</p>
      <p>The collection also contains footage that was not included in any feature film. These
        recordings may have been shot with a potential film in mind, but were never included in any
        completed feature. The Bravos also recorded special events or interviews with notable
        individuals, even though they did not intend to include them in a specific documentary.
        These recordings include an interview with Mikis Theodrakis, a Greek songwriter/composer and
        supporter of Fidel Castro, and an interview with Brazilian Communist Party leader Luis
        Carlos Prestes (1898-1990). There is also some footage which is unidentified or has not yet
        been associated with a specific feature film.</p>
      <p>Between 2014 and 2015, two additional donations of periodicals, programs, playbills,
        transcripts, and related items were added to the collection. They may be found in Series
        XXX: Ephemera and Publications. Transcripts and partial transcripts from this donation
        relate to the film <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> and have been added
        to Series VIII. Transcripts contain interviews of some individuals for which there is no
        film footage, including Walter Sisulu and Kalema Moutante. A small set of film reels,
        donated in 2014, contain personal family footage of Estela and Ernesto Bravo with friends
        and family members, most of which were filmed in 1958. These reels are arranged in Series
        XXXI: Estela and Ernesto Bravo Family Films.</p>
      <p>Many of the dates in this collection have been estimated based on the content and release
        date of the film. Specific dates are listed if they appeared on the cassette annotations,
        while others were inferred from the film's content. The word "Bump" appears in several
        titles, and was used by Estela Bravo to indicate clips selected from a previous, longer,
        piece of footage.</p>

          <p>In the 1989 film <emph render="italic">Americans in Cuba</emph>, Estela Bravo tells the
            stories of several Americans who stayed in Cuba after the 1959 revolution. Some of the
            Americans featured in the documentary lived in Cuba prior and decided to remain after
            the new government was established, while others decided to immigrate to Cuba in the
            period following the revolution. This series contains footage from the 43-minute film,
            including interviews with women such as Elfriede Mahler; Marjorie Moore; Lorna Burdsall;
            Lois Kroehler, a missionary, music teacher and peace advocate who came to Cuba in 1949;
            Jean McEvoy and Ellen Rosensweig, who is interviewed with her husband and children and
            comments on the differences between her life in Cuba and her visits to see her family in
            California. Footage from this film contains one-on-one interviews, performances,
            discussions in the street or in other venues, and scenes of the various locations where
            the women live.</p>

            <p>This interview with Helen Black begins with a discussion about her work in religious
              summer camps and her first travels to Cuba in 1951. She describes the types of people

              which she lived. She explains that her camps were allowed to operate much like they
              did before the revolution, although government required the camps seek permission to
              operate. She discusses her family in the United States and the difficulties of
              traveling between the two countries. She also talks about what she sees as the
              positive and negative changes in Cuba since the revolution. At the end of the video
              she shares her personal philosophy in both English and Spanish, and explains that her

            <p>Lorna Burdsall (1928-2010) moved to Cuba in 1955 with her husband, who fought with
              Fidel Castro in the Cuban revolution. She was a dancer who trained with Martha Graham
              and studied at the Julliard School. In 1953 she met a young Cuban, Manuel Pineiro, who
              was studying business administration at Columbia. They married in New York but he left
              for Cuba to join Castro's forces shortly after their wedding. She joined him in 1955
              and lived in Cuba for the rest of her life. Burdsall taught at the National Dance
              School and was a founding member of Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna, which she
              eventually directed. Burdsall was with the company for nearly 20 years and created
              numerous works reflecting the spirit of the Cuban people. In 1977 she became the
              national director of dance and modern dance advisor to the Minister of Culture.</p>

            <p>This interview with Lorna Burdsall begins with a discussion about her background as a
              dancer and the events that brought her to Cuba. She explains that she met her husband
              who was Cuban in 1953, and moved to Cuba with him in 1955. She discusses her love of
              modern dance, and describes joining the Department of Modern Dance in Cuba's National
              Theater in the early 1960s. She talks about her dance career in Cuba and the country
              has shaped her life. She discusses her experience performing, training and recruiting
              dancers, and the subsidies the government provides to the arts. She also discusses
              traveling between the US and Cuba, and some of the problems the country faces because
              of its poor relationship with the United States.</p>

              first traveled to Cuba in 1949 to work as an English secretary, and soon began
              teaching English in a Presbyterian school. She describes her decision to stay in Cuba

              focuses on religion in Cuba, and Kroehler's experience working as a religious teacher
              in the years since the revolution.</p>

            <p>This video begins with a discussion with Lois Kroehler and her students at the
              Christian seminary where she teaches in Cuba. Kroehler and the students begin by
              singing a song, and then the group discuss what Kroehler is like as a teacher.
              Kroehler describes her life in Cuba and in the seminary, and discusses the
              misconceptions about Cuba she has encountered when talking to other Americans. The
              second half of the video features footage of Kroehler in the classroom leading a group
              of students in a lesson on translation.</p>

            <p>This video begins with Lois Kroehler playing guitar and singing songs. The first two
              songs she sings are in English. She then sings a version of "No Man Is an Island,"
              which she translated into Spanish. Kroehler then describes in Spanish the story of how
              she came to live in Cuba. She explains that she traveled to Cuba to learn Spanish, and
              after 2 years of working as a secretary was asked to stay and work as a teacher at a
              Jesuit school. She later began teaching classes in music and English. Kroehler also
              discusses the difficulty of seeing her family in the United States. She explains that
              it took many years until her family was able to visit her in Cuba.</p>

            <p>This interview with Lois Kroehler begins with a discussion in Spanish of her decision
              to move to Cuba and her experience in Cuba as a Christian. She talks at length about
              being a Christian in a communist country and her personal process of overcoming her
              own anti-communist prejudice. She discusses the United States relationship with Cuba
              and Latin America in general, and expresses a hope that the United States will act as
              a more collaborative neighbor, and do more to consider the struggles of people in the
              third world. The video ends with footage of signs and the countryside outside of
              Matanzas, Cuba.</p>

            <p>This interview with Paul (Pablo) Menendez begins with a discussion about how he first
              traveled to Cuba to study music when he was 14 years old. He explains that his mother,
              singer Barbara Dane, performed in Cuba and later arranged for him to attend a music
              school there in 1966. He explains that youth in California in the 1960s were detached
              and had a very pessimistic view of the future. He explains that life in Cuba at that
              time felt very different and students were engaged in political climate of the early
              revolutionary government. He describes meeting his wife at the school he attended, and
              explains that they married after he had only lived in Cuba for a year. He was only 15
              years old at the time.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with Paul (Pablo) Menendez and his family. It begins
              with his wife discussing her experience of being married to an American. She discusses
              visits to the United States, including New York City and California, and describes the
              experience as a first-hand lesson in capitalism. She discusses the reason she chose to
              live in Cuba over a life in the United States, and explains that as an actress she
              would rather perform in her country. Their son also joins the conversation and
              discusses his education at a music school where he is studying classical guitar.
              Menendez then discusses freedom of expression in Cuban music, and certain restrictions
              that the state places on music that it distributes. He ends with a brief discussion
              about his hopes for the world in the post-colonial era of the late-20th century.</p>

            <p>This video contains two takes of an interview with Pablo Menendez, his wife Adria
              Santana, and their son Osamu Menendez. Pablo talks about how he came to study music in
              Cuba as a teenager, and meeting Adria at the National School of Art where they were
              both students. Adria speaks briefly about her work as an actress, and Osamu speaks
              about his musical and high school studies. Pablo discusses his music, Cuban music, and
              the New Song Movement in Cuba. Halfway through the video, the audio becomes out of
              sync and the family does a second take of their interview.</p>

            <p>In this interview with Marjorie Moore, she begins by introducing herself and
              explaining how she moved to Cuba in 1950 following her marriage to Cuban businessman
              Luis Rios. She discusses her wealthy life in Cuba prior to the revolution, and
              explains why she and her husband decided to stay. At minute 9:30 Rios joins the
              interview and they both describe their decisions to support the revolution despite
              pressure from Rios's family to leave the country. They discuss their lives and work
              after the revolution, and Moore talks specifically her contribution to Cuba's 1961
              literacy campaign. Finally, they briefly discuss the housing shortage in Cuba, and
              explain that the shortage has forced them to share a home with their two adult
              daughters and grandchildren.</p>

            <p>This video features portions of an interview with Marjorie Moore and her husband Luis
              Rios. Moore and Rios discuss what their lives were like prior to the Cuban revolution
              and their decision to stay in Cuba. Moore discusses her identity as an American living
              in Cuba, and her relationship with her family living in America. She explains that her
              family is not sympathetic to the revolution, and expresses disappointment that US and
              Cuba have not maintained better relations. Both Rios and Moore discuss how the
              revolution shaped the direction of their lives, and explain that they stayed in Cuba
              because of their positive impressions of Fidel Castro. They also briefly discuss
              raising children in Cuba and the community of Americans who came to live in Cuba
              following the revolution. Much of the interview features loud background noises that
              make portions difficult to hear.</p>

              Paul's union activism made him a political target during the McCarthy era, and her
              children describe the impact of his deportation on their family. Paskalitis describes
              how the family moved to Cuba in 1960 when Paul took a job working for the Cuban
              fishing industry. The family talks generally about adjusting to life in Cuba, their
              work, and their identities as Greek, American, and Cuban.</p>

              sense of security she feels in her job, and in her ability to get medical care as she
              and her husband get older. She also discusses how she is received as an American in
              Cuba, and her children Andrew and Marianne discuss some of the discrimination they
              faced when they were in primary school and at the university. The end of the interview
              features a discussion about problems they see in Cuba, notably continued shortage of
              goods and services, and a growing tourist industry that caters to tourists at the
              exclusion of Cubans.</p>

            <p>This video contains two interviews with Barbara Paskalitis. The first interview is at
              her workplace, where she talks about the work she did at a fur factory in the United
              States, the English tutoring she did when she first arrived in Cuba, and her current
              work as of the date of the interview. Her coworkers are crowded around her, and there
              is some footage of her working at her work station. The second part of the video
              contains footage of an interview with the Paskalitis family at home. Paul Paskalitis
              talks about his deportation from the United States during the McCarthy era due to his
              political beliefs and union activity, and each family member talks about what it was
              like to come to Cuba in 1960 at the beginning of the revolution.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with Olita Proctor, an American living in Cuba, and
              her mother and fiancé. Proctor begins by discussing how she first moved to Cuba in
              1971 after traveling to the country with the progressive student group the Venceremos
              Brigade. She explains that she felt at home in Cuba and decided to stay after being
              expelled from her American high school because of her political activism. Proctor and
              her mother talk about racism in the United States, and Proctor explains that as a
              biracial woman she has felt more in welcome Cuba. She also discusses US policy toward
              Cuba, her hopes that the US embargo against Cuba will end, and her sense of shame
              about America's treatment of Cuba. At the end of the interview she expresses her hope
              that all of her cousins and nephews could come to Cuba to meet her Cuban family. Video
              quality of this recording is poor in places.</p>

              for medical sciences. She lectures for several minutes and then takes questions from
              her students. At the end of the video Moore's students discuss their impressions of

              Her students describe her as a supportive and hardworking teacher, although several
              admit that they were initially intimidated by her class.</p>

            <p>This video features footage of Peruvian politician Alfonso Barrantes touring a
              neighborhood in Lima, Peru and speaking to community members about his "Vaso de Leche"
              (Glass of Milk) program. The footage shows Barrantes speaking with community members
              and shows children drinking milk that the local government supplies to hungry children
              in the city. The video then features a teacher from a local school who explains how
              the program works. Many of the parents and educators featured in brief interviews
              mention that prior to the program the children in the village had never tasted
              milk.</p>

            <p>This video features a speech by Peruvian President Alan García delivered at the Plaza
              de Armas sometime around the year 1987. García calls for unity among Latin American
              nations to fight against the crisis of foreign debt facing their countries. He
              criticizes wealthy nations in the north, international banks, creditors, and global
              financial organizations for taking advantage of Latin America. He argues that economic
              imperialism has led to Peru's fiscal crisis and has created extreme suffering and
              poverty in Peru. He contends that the only way to push back against the insurmountable
              debt payments is through unity among Latin American nations.</p>

            <p>This video begins with footage of a play. At minute 6:20 it changes to still images
              of a funeral procession. Then at minute 8:45 it changes to footage of on-the-street
              interviews in Argentina. Estela Bravo asks several individuals about the country's
              political situation and foreign debt. Several of the interviewees express frustration
              with the country's politics, arguing that there is high unemployment and little
              opportunity for the average citizen to create political change. Several individuals
              discuss the country's foreign debt. They question the government's ability to pay its
              debt and argue that average communities suffer in poverty in the meantime.</p>

            <p>The first portion of this video features footage of Mexico City following the 1985
              earthquake that damaged large portions of the city. This footage does not contain any
              audio, but at times audio from unrelated content can be heard in the background. At
              minute 10:24 the video changes to footage of a young boy and girl who explain that
              they sell flowers to support their family and pay for school. During a brief interview
              with Estela Bravo the boy and girl also talk about other children who take drugs,
              although they say they do not. Bravo then interviews several children on the street
              who are taking drugs and asks them why they were attracted to drugs.</p>

            <p>This video features on-the-street interviews with Argentinians in the mid-1980s
              discussing the effect of foreign debt on their country. Many talk about the negative
              consequences of the debt on the country's children, poor, and elderly. Estela Bravo
              asks many members of the crowd what will happen if Argentina decides not to pay the
              debt. Many express their concern that the poor will suffer, and others discuss the
              possibility of Latin American countries collectively deciding not to pay the debt. One
              member of the crowd suggests that without unity among Latin American nations the
              decision to not pay would result in economic chaos. Several men in the crowd note that
              they have been out of work for many years, and others speculate about what will happen
              in Argentina's future.</p>

            <p>This video begins with on-the-street interviews with people in Peru discussing the
              effect of foreign debt on their country. Some individuals suggest that the debt is the
              fault of the investing class, while others express their concerns about the poor and
              the lack of investment in schools and social services. Several members of the crowd
              argue about whether Peru should pay the debt or whether they should attempt to resist
              foreign investors and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In another short
              interview two boys tell the story of a child who was abandoned in a park by his
              impoverished parents. At minute 14:00 the video changes to an interview with Peruvian
              economist Óscar Ugarteche. He describes the conditions that led to the debt crisis in
              Peru and expresses his skepticism about the country's ability to pay the debt.</p>

            <p>This video features the end of an interview with Peruvian economist Óscar Ugarteche.
              He discusses the economic crisis in Peru. In the interview, which was recorded in the
              mid-1980s, Ugarteche explains that the crisis had been building for over 10 years, and
              while the government focused on paying its international debt, it was not investing in
              the economy. He discusses the crisis of poverty, childhood hunger, and unemployment,
              and discusses economic changes that he thinks the country should take to emerge from
              the crisis. At minute 9:55 the video changes to a rally for Peruvian politician Alan
              García. Rally footage is incomplete and only contains short segments of his speech.
              The end of the video features footage of a concert.</p>

            <p>This video features street footage and footage from a school in Bogotá, Colombia. It
              begins with two teachers at a kindergarten discussing the services they provide for
              poor children in the community. They describe the schools as a consistent source of
              food for local children. They also discuss high unemployment in the country and child
              malnutrition. The footage shows the children in the school singing songs and
              participating in a lesson on the alphabet. The video then changes to street footage of
              a slum outside of Bogotá where one of the teachers discusses the effects of foreign
              debt on the economy, the growth of slums, her Christian belief in Liberation Theology,
              and efforts to improve conditions in poor communities in the city. The video then cuts
              to footage of a different part of the city showing children selling goods on the
              street.</p>

            <p>This video features a series of clips from Peruvian news segments. The news segments
              feature reports on an extreme drought that destroyed crops and livestock in Peruvian
              agricultural regions, health conditions in poor communities, child hunger, an
              encampment of protesters seeking government assistance, and interviews with
              individuals about the state of the Peruvian economy. The footage features a segment
              titled "Enquesta," in which a reporter asks children what they ate for breakfast, and
              a number of the children reply that they had no breakfast at all.</p>

            <p>This video features footage of a village in Argentina. It begins with a guide
              describing the poverty within the community. Estela Bravo then interviews several men
              on the street who talk about closed factories and unemployment. She tours an area
              where an irrigation ditch is filled with garbage, and interviews several men who make
              money collecting and re-selling garbage for parts. She also interviews a young boy
              selling candy on the street to help feed his family. The guide later explains to Bravo
              that the community relies on schools as a consistent source of food for children, and
              blames Argentina's dictatorship for the debt and austerity that has impoverished the
              community.</p>

            <p>This videos features footage of a community center in a poor village in Argentina
              that serves food and provides medical services to children in the community. The
              footage begins with an interview with the priest who supports the center. He discusses
              the problem of hunger in the community and explains that they feed 270 children. He
              explains that many parents are unemployed and cannot provide food for their children.
              The priest also shows Estela Bravo a baby at the community center, and explains that
              it is the child of a 13-year-old girl. He explains that young girls seek work as
              domestic servants, but those jobs were increasingly difficult to obtain and some
              turned to prostitution. The end of the video features an interview with two doctors at
              the center. They explain that they treated problems of malnutrition and parasitic
              infections, which were caused by unsanitary living conditions and lack of clean
              drinking water.</p>

            <p>This video features a tour of a poor village in Argentina. It begins with footage of
              children sharing lunch in a school, and features shots of the streets and people in
              the village. The footage shows a priest speaking with people in the village, greeting
              them, and introducing them to Estela Bravo. Bravo asks several men and women about
              their country's foreign debt, and several speak about the extreme poverty in their
              community, the lack of jobs, and their dependence on government support. The priest
              shows Bravo a field fill with garbage and describes how men in the village sort the
              garbage and sell what they gather for parts. He explains that it is dangerous work,
              which contributes to many diseases in the community, and that the villagers live among
              the garbage daily.</p>

            <p>This video contains various clips documenting the exchange of Cuban prisoners in
              Namibia for the South African soldier Johan Papenfus. The video begins with several
              short clips, and at minute 2:48 switches to an interview with Cuban soldiers talking
              about Papenfus. Minute 7:00-18:29 features an interview with Papenfus conducted by
              Estela Bravo. Beginning at minute 18:30 the video shows footage of Papenfus traveling
              back to South Africa, which makes up the bulk of the video. The video also contains
              short interviews with Cuban soldier Bernardo Heredia, who was held as a prisoner of
              war by South Africa and was one of several people exchanged for Papenfus. Two portions
              of the interview with Hererida begin at minute 22:15 and minute 44:32.</p>

            <p>The first 30 minutes of this video features interviews with Cubans in the Parque
              Central in Havana. Estela Bravo asks about Cuba's support of Angola's war against
              South Africa, and the Cuban troops coming home from the war. Members of the crowd
              describe their understanding of the war and Cuba's reason for supporting the Angola.
              Many express their approval of Cuba's role in the war and speak generally about racial
              equality and the need to fight against apartheid in South Africa. One man discusses
              his reason for not volunteering to fight, and he argues with many others in the crowd.
              The second half of this video features an assortment of clips from footage in South
              Africa including a musical concert, short interviews with South Africans and Angolans,
              crowd footage, and Cubans who fought in Namibia. When footage is in English, Bravo
              speaks over the footage translating into Spanish.</p>

            <p>This video includes footage of a reception welcoming Cuban soldiers home upon their
              return from Angola. The video begins with soldiers disembarking from a plane and
              shaking hands with Cuban military and civil leaders. It continues with footage of a
              military procession, and at minute 6:25 several speakers address the crowd. Speakers
              congratulate the Cuban soldiers on their successful mission in Angola and praise
              solidarity between Cuba and the Angolan people. They also celebrate Cuban solidarity
              with revolutionary movements across Latin America and Africa and talk about the memory
              of the Cuban revolution.</p>

            <p>This video consists of three separate clips filmed by Estela Bravo. The first portion
              features a speech to a crowd of Angolan and Cuban soldiers after the 1989 ceasefire
              between Angola and South Africa. The speaker is not filmed; instead footage focuses on
              individuals in the crowd including Fidel Castro, Angolan soldiers, and several
              children. The speaker praises the role of the Cuban military, the Namibian political
              party SWAPO, and international solidarity. After the speech Castro greets members of
              the crowd. At minute 16:17 the video switches to footage of equipment in an industrial
              yard and the construction of a truck trailer. At minute 18:49 it changes to footage of
              a ballet performance.</p>

          <p>Estela and Ernesto Bravo filmed <emph render="italic">The Cuban Excludables</emph>
            after 1984 hearings, which granted the release of Cuban "excludable aliens" that had
            been indefinitely detained after serving prison sentences. The term "excludable alien"
            is a legal distinction that refers to immigrants or refugees who were not granted a path
            to citizenship because of criminal records. Approximately 2,500 of the Cubans who
            traveled to the United States during the Mariel Boatlift were given the "excludable"
            distinction and detained in American prisons. Estela and Ernesto Bravo interviewed
            detainees returning to Cuba and spoke with activists and attorneys involved in legal the
            battles. </p>
          <p>In 1995, <emph render="italic">The Cuban Excludables</emph> won a Special Jury Prize at
            Cinefest, San Juan, Puerto Rico; and One World Award, Best Overseas Production on

          <p>This series contains full-length copies of <emph render="italic">The Cuban
              Excludables</emph> (1994), as well as interviews with a variety of individuals
            including US District Judge Marvin Shoob; Wayne Smith, former head the United States
            Interests Section in Havana; and Dennis (Denny) McLain, a former American baseball
            player who spent time in prison with the Cuban detainees. Other interviewees include
            lawyers and human rights activists, Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and
            Coast Guard employees; correctional officers and other prison staff, and the detainees
            themselves, along with family members. Of particular interest are interviews with Dr.
            Bolivar Martineau, deputy warden and chief medical officer at the Atlanta Penitentiary
            where detainees were held. Interviews with Dr. Bolivar Martineau and Denny McLain were
            arranged and funded by 5th Estate Canadian Broadcasting System who used the footage for
            a period of time and then turned it over to the Bravos for their film.</p>
          <p>In addition to the interviews, footage in this series contains news clips, footage from
            the prisons, interviews with the American families of some of the detainees, and scenes
            from Cuba, as the detainees arrived home and were reunited with their Cuban families.
            Walkiria Fernandez, an employee of the Cuban Ministry of the Interior, appears in many
            of the clips with the detainees once they arrive in Cuba. Some of the material is
            duplicative and there is large amount of background footage and shots of leaving and
            arriving planes.</p>

            <p>This video features brief interviews with Cuban detainees shortly after they were
              deported to Cuba. Several describe their experiences in the United States, discussing
              the prisons where they were held, experiences of racism, and difficulty of life in the
              US. For much of the video a woman speaks to the prisoners about how to rebuild their
              lives in Cuba. She explains that although they cannot return to their lives and
              families in the United State, they should try to adjust to living in Cuba as best as
              they can by reconnecting with family and finding work. Many of the prisoners can be
              seen crying and others are visibly distressed.</p>

            <p>This video begins with footage of Miami radio host Francisco Aruca speaking to
              callers on his radio program <emph render="italic">Ayer en Miami</emph>. The footage
              shows Aruca in his studio and then cuts to a brief interview. Aruca talks about
              reporting on the Cuban community in Miami, and how discussions about corruption in the
              community has angered many exiled Cubans in Miami. He also describes the difference
              between Cuban cultures in Miami and Havana, and explains the importance of maintaining
              a connection to Cuban culture for Cuban-Americans, notably through music. The end of
              the video features several news clips about the death of Jorge Mas Canosa, a leader
              among anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Miami. The final minutes of the video feature brief
              interview segments with Luis Ortega and Denny McLain.</p>

            <p>This interview with Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer Duke Austin
              focuses on the deportation and detention of Cuban excludable immigrants. Austin begins
              by discussing the deportation process and addresses concerns about family members who
              were not notified when their relatives were deported back to Cuba. He also discusses
              and defends the policies that led to the detention of Cuban immigrants, and the type
              of people who the United States detained. Austin compares United States immigration
              policy for Cubans with its policy for other countries, and details the process by
              which a deported Cuban could petition to be readmitted to the United States.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with two women whose husbands were deported
              following their detention by the US Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS).
              They both describe learning about their husbands' deportations only after they
              received a box of their belongings from the prison. They also describe the effect the
              deportations and separation have had on their families, and their fears that their
              husbands would be killed if they were returned to Cuba. They both express their desire

              other women whose husbands were deported.</p>

              about the community activist who helped facilitate his release, and calls her forward

              and that now in Cuba he can get job training and be close to his family. The video

            <p>This video features interviews between Linden McIntyre and two Cuban detainees who
              were deported to Cuba. The first, Pablo, speaks with McIntyre about how US prisons
              profited off of the government funds they received for holding Cuban excludable
              aliens. Later they discuss his family, and Pablo cries as he explains that he does not
              know if he will be able to see them again. The next interview features Orlando Sierra
              who describes the events that led to his detention by US immigration and the confusing
              legal process he went through before he was deported. He describes being arrested for
              several non-violent crimes in the 1980s, being detained by immigration in 1991, and

              Cuba and why he chose to leave his country. He talks about the Fort Chaffee uprising
              in 1980, where Cuban refugees from the Mariel boatlift were detained, and how the
              refugees detained there rioted against the conditions at the camp and governmental

            <p>This video features an interview with attorney Gary Leshaw. Leshaw begins by
              discussing how he came to represent Cuban detainees known as "excludables" through the
              organization Atlanta Legal Aid. He talks at length about the policy of US Immigration
              and Naturalization Service (INS) that led to the detention of these people, and his
              firm's attempts to obtain trails for the detainees. He later discusses attempts to end
              the detention of Cuban excludable aliens through legislation, but suggests that they
              did not have significant support from the Cuban community in the US to pass
              legislation in their favor. He ends the tape with a short discussion about Judge
              Marvin Shoob's attempts to secure due process for the detainees.</p>

            <p>This interview with Dr. Bolivar Martineau begins with a discussion about the prison
              riots in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in 1984 and 1987. He discusses how the riots
              affected prison staff and how relationships between staff who were taken hostage and
              those who were not changed after those events. He also describes some of the Mariel
              Cubans he worked with in the prison and discusses what he thinks will happen to many
              of them if they are deported to Cuba. The end of this interview features a lengthy
              discussion about prison tattoos and their meanings.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with Dr. Bolivar Martineau. Dr. Martineau begins by
              describing how he became involved in treating Cuban detainees in American prisons. He
              describes his first experience working with detainees at the Fort Chaffee prison in
              Arkansas, and later at the U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta. Martineau discusses riots by
              Cuban detainees in several prisons and the psychological disorders he witnessed in
              many of the detainees. He describes many detainees as having unclear diagnoses and
              unpredictable behavior, and recounts the story of one detainee who committed suicide
              while in custody. At the end of the interview he begins to discuss his psychiatric
              evaluations of detainees at Atlanta.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with Dr. Bolivar Martineau conducted by Canadian
              journalist Linden McIntyre. In the interview Martineau discusses how he started
              working at the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta where he treated Cuban detainees. He
              discusses the people he treated and describes many of them as suffering from a wide
              range of mental illnesses. He describes the psychiatric ward he presided over at the
              prison, the reason for its creation, and the ways in which his staff diagnosed, and
              treated Cuban detainees. McIntyre specifically asks Martineau to speak about the use
              of the sedative Thorazine to subdue patients, and address complaints from former
              prisoners about abuses in the psychiatric ward.</p>

            <p>In this interview two Cuban detainees Jorge Luis Demagne and Daniel Iglesias discuss
              their treatment in United States prisons in Atlanta, Georgia and Talladega, Alabama.
              They begin by discussing how they met and the circumstances that led to their
              detention. They discuss the prison riot in Atlanta, and the treatment of detainees at
              the prison. The bulk of the interview focuses on the treatment of Cuban detainees by
              Dr. Bolivar Martineau, who they said performed medical experiments on them and
              administered the drug Thorazine without their consent as a means to control their
              behavior.</p>

            <p>In this video, Denny McLain begins with his account of corruption in the U.S.
              Penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia. He asserts that attorney Herb Shafer took payments

              how the two women became involved in activism on behalf the Mariel Cubans detained at

              explain that their acquaintance had been arrested and sent to Atlanta, and encouraged

              activism, meeting family members of the detainees, and the individual stories of the

            <p>This video features an interview with Judge Marvin Shoob. Before the interview begins
              Shoob and Estela Bravo informally discuss Dr. Bolivar Martineau and baseball player
              Denny McLain. The official interview begins around minute 3:00 and features a
              discussion about Cubans who were detained by Immigration and Naturalization Services
              (INS), and the difficulty of obtaining individual trials for these people. He shares a
              story about a man who he argued never should have been detained by INS, but was held
              in a US prison for several years because of what he describes as an arbitrary decision
              and a failure to individually address his case. Shoob also discusses his attempts to
              gain the release of several detainees and the resistance he encountered from the
              federal government and prison administrators.</p>

            <p>In this interview Judge Marvin Shoob discusses his defense of Cuban detainees' rights
              of habeas corpus, and the Supreme Court's decision not to hear his case. He also
              shares a story how his experiences during World War II influenced his approach to his
              career as a judge. He discusses controversial statements former New York City Mayor
              Rudy Giuliani made about the Cuban detainees Shoob wanted released, and the
              consequences of those statements on his safety and the process of releasing
              individuals. Finally, he describes conditions detainees faced in American prisons,
              which led some detainees to suicide or self-harm.</p>

            <p>In this portion of an interview with Judge Marvin Shoob, Estela Bravo speaks with
              Shoob about his advocacy for Cuban detainees in American prisons. The beginning of the
              video discusses the 1987 Atlanta prison riots, and the role of Cuban detainees in
              those riots. At minute 12:43 Shoob's wife joins the conversation and talks about the
              death threats she and her husband received as a result of Judge Shoob's support of the
              Cuban detainees. The bulk of the interview discusses the human rights concerns about
              detaining Cuban exiles convicted of minor crimes indefinitely, and the policy
              decisions that led to their detention.</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview with Judge Marvin Shoob. Shoob begins by
              outlining how he was assigned to the Cuban excludables cases and describing how these
              individuals first came to be detained. He describes reviewing the cases of the Cubans
              held at the Atlanta penitentiary, and talks at length about the legal situations that
              led to their detention and his efforts to get many of them released. Some of the
              content of this video is duplicated on other tapes, but this tape contains the most
              complete recording. At minute 49:00 the video changes to an interview with criminology
              professor Sheila Van Ness. She discusses the immigration trails for the Cuban
              detainees and the difficulty of advocating on their behalf. Van Ness describes how she
              interviewed many of the Cubans at the penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana and her
              perception of the legal process surrounding their cases.</p>

              journalist Linden McIntyre. The interview begins with a discussion of the events that
              led to the Mariel Boatlift in 1980. Smith cites Cuban attempts to establish normalized
              immigration policies with the United States, hijackings of Cuban boats by individuals
              seeking to reach the US, and the occupation of the Peruvian embassy in Cuba in 1980.
              He talks at length about the legal status of the Mariel Cubans who were listed as
              excludable, and others who were paroled into the country upon arrival. He also
              discusses the unique situation of Mariel, and the human rights abuses that many Mariel
              Cubans faced after they were detained by US immigration.</p>

            <p>This interview features American diplomat Wayne Smith speaking with Canadian
              journalist Linden McIntyre. The interview begins with a discussion of diplomatic
              relations between the United States and Cuba, tensions that led to the crisis of the
              Mariel Boatlift, and the excludable immigrants that arrived in the United States among
              that group. Smith discusses diplomatic talks between Cuba and the United States that
              took place under the administration of Jimmy Carter, but were stalled after Ronald
              Reagan took office. He talks about this history of US immigration policy toward Cuba
              and expresses his hope that the incoming Clinton administration will normalize
              relations. The last 10 minutes of the video focus on interviewer Linden McIntyre and
              feature him restating questions to make them more succinct for the edited film.</p>

            <p>This interview with American diplomat Wayne Smith begins with a discussion about
              Cubans attempting to cross the Strait of Florida on rafts, which transitions into a
              discussion about Cuban "excludable aliens." This part of the interview focuses on
              United States immigration policy toward Cuba, which Smith describes as a double
              standard when compared to countries like Haiti. He also discusses the US immigration
              policy that led to the detention of the Cuban "excludables," and criticizes the United
              States for not doing more to restore normal relations with Cuba. Smith discusses the
              political influence of the Miami Cuban community and expresses his disappointment that
              Cubans and American have not had the opportunity to communicate with each other for
              many years.</p>

              Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer Duke Austin, and attorney Rafael
              Penalver. The three interviews focus on INS and US government policy that led to the

              detention of Cuban "excludable aliens" from different perspectives, and include
              anecdotes about individuals held by US immigration services. The end of the video
              features a series of interviews with Cuban detainees after they were deported to Cuba.
              They discuss their treatment in American prisons and the events that led their

            <p>This video contains footage of an U.S. Immigration plane landing in Cuba and the
              transfer of the prisoners from U.S. custody to Cuban authorities. The deported
              prisoners are transferred from the plane onto a bus. In her conversation with the
              prisoners, Estela explains she is making a film for viewers in London and asks their
              names, how long they were in the United States, and if they are happy to be back. The
              prisoners share their experiences living in the United States. Many talk about being
              happy to return after realizing that life in the United States was harder than they
              anticipated, such as with the discrimination they faced there. The video also includes
              cutaway, close-up, and background shots.</p>

            <p>The interviews with Denny McLain and Dr. Martineau featured on this video were funded
              by the Canadian Broadcasting System television investigative documentary program The
              Fifth Estate. CBS used the footage and then returned it to the Bravos for their

            <p>Most of the footage involves interviews with returned detainees and their families.

              a brief clip of Dr. Bolivar Martineau, then at 57 minutes, discussion with someone who
              worked at the prison with Martineau. There is a brief discussion with Denny McLain

            <p>This video features interviews with three different Cuban prisoners at the US Federal
              Prison Camp in Terre Haute, Indiana. In the interviews the prisoners discuss how they
              came to the United States and why they were imprisoned. The interviews focus
              predominantly on the detention and treatment of the three men in the prisons. They
              also describe the political situation that has led to their indefinite incarceration,
              and the struggles they have faced while detained.</p>

              explain that the boy has a complicated heart condition that they cannot treat. They
              discuss Peru's limited medical resources, and the need to send patients with more
              complicated medical issues to hospitals and clinics in Brazil. They explain they are
              only able to offer palliative care to the boy, and that he will need to go to another

              >Anecdotes about Fidel</emph>. The 2001 documentary <emph render="italic">Fidel: The

            complete interviews and portions of interviews highlighted in the two films. They
            feature historians, public figures, close friends, and Castro himself, and provide a
            glimpse into the life and personality of the Cuban leader. Interviewees include Alice
            Walker, Gabriel García Márquez, Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, Ted Turner, Nelson
            Mandela, Charles Rangel, George McGovern, Philip Agee, and many others who share
            personal anecdotes along with political and historical perspectives.</p>
          <p>The anecdotes come not only from well-known Americans such as Harry Belafonte, Jesse
            Jackson, Angela Davis, Hank Aaron, Sydney Pollack and others, but also from many Cubans
            who are not well known in the United States. Among them are government officials and
            friends of Fidel such as Juan Almeida, Melba Hernández. Alfredo Guevara, Jorge Risquet,
            Antonio Núñez Jiménez, Alicia Alonso, Angela Castro, and Aleida Guevara.</p>
          <p>This series also contains a number of interviews that are not seen in the films. They
            include discussions with Hortensia Bussi de Allende, the widow of Salvador Allende, and
            American lawyer Victor Rabinowitz.</p>
          <p>Footage in this series also consists of clips from the Cuban State Council Archives and
            various news sources. Videos containing State Council footage often represent a wide
            date range. Some of the footage is dated 1998 which reflects the date the material was
            obtained, not the actual date of the events. The original dates of the footage were not
            recorded. Additional footage depicts Fidel Castro at a number of public events giving
            speeches or speaking with world leaders. Other materials in this series include
            documents related to the promotion and distribution of <emph render="italic"

            <p>This video features an interview with baseball player Hank Aaron. At the beginning,
              Aaron briefly introduces himself and discusses his baseball career. The bulk of the
              interview focuses on Aaron's impression of Cuba and Fidel Castro. Aaron describes
              traveling to Cuba to film a documentary about Cuban baseball players, and describes
              the quality of education and baseball training he observed while in Cuba. He also
              discusses meeting Fidel Castro, and speaks specifically about Castro's athletic
              ability. Aaron also talks briefly about the poor diplomatic relations between Cuba and
              the United States, and argues that lack of trade and freedom of movement between the
              countries has contributed to the suffering of Cuban people and their family members in
              the United States.</p>

              People's Power from 1993-2013. During his time at the UN, Alarcon held several leading

            <p>This video features a portion of an interview with Ricardo Alarcón. At the beginning
              of the interview Alarcón discusses the political and diplomatic positions he has held
              within the Cuban government, including President of the National Assembly and United
              Nations ambassador. He discusses receiving the appointment of UN ambassador at the age
              of 28, and his inexperience in that position. He also describes meeting Fidel Castro
              for the first time when Castro's revolutionary forces entered Havana in January 1959.
              The bulk of the interview focuses on Alarcón's memories of Havana during the
              revolutionary period and the uncertainty during those years.</p>

            <p>This video features a portion of an interview with Ricardo Alarcón. The recording
              does not start at the beginning and appears to only contain a portion of a larger
              interview. In this portion, Alarcón addresses Estela Bravo's questions about criticism
              of Cuba's lack of free press by comparing Cuba's press with privately owned newspapers
              in the United States. He criticizes the United States electoral system, which he
              contrasts with Cuban local elections. In the second half of the interview he talks
              about Cuba's role in Latin America, discussing both support for the Cuban government
              and opposition from what he describes as counter-revolutionary movements. He also
              talks about the significance of Fidel Castro's beard and his predictions for Cuba's
              future after Castro's presidency.</p>

            <p>This portion of an interview with Ricardo Alarcón begins with a discussion about Cuba
              in years before the overthrow of Fulgencio Batista's government. He discusses his
              memories of the revolution and the reaction of many Cubans to the revolution. He talks
              about the political trials following the revolution, and defends the actions of the
              new government. Estela Bravo asks Alarcón to describe what he views as the biggest
              successes and failures in the 40 years since the revolution, and Alarcón describes
              several domestic policies. They also discuss the ration booklets issued by the Cuban
              government, and Alarcón criticizes inequality in the United States.</p>

            <p>This video features segments of two separate interviews. The first interview features
              Cuban politician Ricardo Alarcón. In this brief segment, Alarcón discusses Fidel
              Castro's personal appearance as a symbol of the revolution, the numerous assassination
              attempts made against Castro over the years, and the reasons many powerful people have
              expressed interest in meeting him. At minute 12:42 the footage changes to an interview
              with Castro's translator Juanita Vera García. García discusses how she became Castro's
              translator, and talks about what it is like to travel with Castro and act as
              interpreter for some of his long public speeches.</p>

              <p>Juan Almeida Bosque (1927-2009) was an important figure in the Cuban Revolution and
                later a Cuban official. He was the only Afro-Cuban to participate in the attack on
                the Moncada Barracks in 1953, and was also among the revolutionaries who
                participated in the 1956 Granma Yacht landing. He was later appointed the commander
                of the Third Front. During the US-sponsored Bay of Pigs operation in April 1961,
                Almeida commanded the Cuban military's Central Army. Later a prominent figure in the
                Communist Party of Cuba, Almeida was, at the time of his death, Vice-President of
                the Cuban Council of State and its third ranking member.</p>

              <p>In this portion Juan Almeida talks about Fidel Castro as a symbol of the
                revolution, briefly discussing the significance of Castro's beard. He also talks
                about Castro's views of justice, his support of Angolan independence, and the
                anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa. He later discusses his feelings surrounding
                Castro's failing health.</p>

            <p>Francisco Gonzales Aruca (1941-2013) was a Cuban-American economist. He was a student
              at a Jesuit school in Havana at the time of the Cuban Revolution. He joined the
              counterrevolution and was arrested in 1961 by the Castro government. His political
              ideology later shifted in favor of the Cuban government, and he started the company
              Marazul Charters in New York with a goal of uniting fractured Cuban families.</p>

            <p>In this interview Francisco Aruca discusses people's polarized views of Fidel Castro.
              He discusses his own feelings about Castro, and spends some time talking about
              Castro's curiosity for politics. In the interview Estela Bravo asks Aruca about the
              slogan "No Castro, No Problem." Aruca talks about what he believes are problems with
              the sentiments behind the slogan, and suggests that in the present political climate,
              Cuba would be destabilized without Castro.</p>

            <p>This video contains portions of an interview with singer Harry Belafonte and his wife
              Julie Robinson. The interview begins with an anecdote about Belafonte bringing Fidel
              Castro a gift of cheese, and the caution with which Castro's body guards viewed the
              gift in light of the numerous assassination attempts that have been made against
              Castro. The bulk of the interview focuses on Belafonte's travels to Cuba with his
              family. He discusses his musical performances, and his children's enjoyment of Cuban
              culture. Robinson discusses bringing her parents to Cuba, and their request to be
              buried there after they died.</p>

            <p>This video features a portion of an interview with Peter Bourne. Bourne begins with a
              lengthy discussion about the custody struggle over Elián González and the United
              States decision to return him to Cuba. He talks about the ways in which the struggle
              shifted Americans' perceptions of both Cuba and the exile community in Miami. The
              conversation then shifts to a general discussion about the way American opinions about
              Cuba are shaped by the press, which Bourne contrasts with that of other Latin American
              countries. The second part of the interview focuses on human rights in Cuba,
              healthcare, and education. He also briefly discusses why some Cubans have left the
              country, the Cuban economy, and the waning support Cuba received from the Soviet Union
              beginning in the 1980s.</p>

            <p>This interview features Peter Bourne continuing a discussion about the Cuban economy
              and Cuba's relationship with the Soviet Union in the 1980s. The bulk of this video
              features Bourne repeating various anecdotes to capture specific language and topical
              transitions to be used in Estela Bravo's documentary. Topics addressed in these
              segments include Fidel Castro's brief marriage to Mirta Díaz-Balart, the invasion of
              Granma beach, Celia Sanchez, the trials of individuals from the Batista government
              following the revolution, and Cuba's relationship with revolutionary movements in
              Chile, Vietnam, Nicaragua, and Grenada.</p>

            <p>This interview with Peter Bourne begins with a discussion about Cuba's interest in
              supporting African independence movements and perceptions of Fidel Castro in the third
              world. Bourne describes Castro as an elder statesman among nationalist leaders in
              developing nations, and discusses his image as a role model for other young leaders.
              He then turns to a discussion about Castro's meeting with Pope John Paul II,
              describing the dynamic between the two men and the motivations behind the meeting.
              Bourne speaks about Castro's leadership in Cuba addressing concerns about human
              rights, and Castro's role as a leader in the post-colonial era. He ends with a brief
              discussion about the history of American influence in Cuba and his expectations for
              Cuba's fate after the United States lifts the trade embargo and after Castro leaves
              office.</p>

            <p>This interview with Peter Bourne primarily contains repetitions of previous topics
              addressed in earlier interviews with Estela Bravo. Bourne restates several of the same
              points in an attempt to provide fluidity for segments used in Bravo's documentary. He
              begins by discussing Castro's relationship with his first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart and
              their son Fidelito. He also discusses Fidel's relationship with Celia Sanchez and the
              important role she played in his life. He then changes to a discussion about the
              immediate aftermath of the Cuban revolution, discussing why people decided to leave,
              the trials of former Batista government officials, and the development of contentious
              diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. Bourne ends with several
              short discussions about Castro's relationship with leaders in Vietnam, Chile,
              Nicaragua, and Grenada.</p>

            <p>In this interview segment Peter Bourne discusses Fidel Castro's role in the Caribbean
              and his image as a leader. He begins by discussing Castro's relationship with
              revolutionary leaders like Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Maurice Bishop in Grenada,
              and explains that Castro was reluctant to support revolutionary movements in Latin
              America and the Caribbean after the Nicaraguan revolution. Bourne also discusses
              Castro's physical image, and speaks briefly about his decision to stop smoking cigars
              and wearing military fatigues. In the second half of the interview Bourne discusses
              Cuban elections, and the medical training Cuba provides to students in Latin
              America.</p>

            <p>In this portion of an interview with Peter Bourne, Bourne discusses the life of Fidel
              Castro and his experience as Castro's biographer. Bourne begins by talking about
              Castro's childhood and relationship with his parents. He also discusses Castro's
              experience at the University of Havana, and describes corruption at Cuban universities
              during that era. He discusses the ways in which Castro's upbringing influenced his
              political ideology, specifically citing his mother's Christianity. Later in the
              interview Bourne describes the influential women in Castro's life including Mirta
              Díaz-Balart, to whom he was married for 2 years, and his long-time partner Celia
              Sanchez. Bourne also talks at length about Castro's character and the impression he
              makes on the people who meet him. This interview was recorded in London and was not
              conducted by Estela Bravo, but rather an unidentified man who speaks off camera.</p>

            <p>The bulk of this video features an interview with Peter Bourne. Bourne begins by
              speaking about the aftermath of the Cuban revolution specifically addressing the
              refugees and the trials of individuals connected to the Batista government. He also
              discusses Cuba's support of revolutions in Latin America, Castro's relationship with
              Maurice Bishop, the custody battle over Elián González, Cuban healthcare, Castro's
              views on globalization, and restrictions on freedom of speech. At minute 25:00 the
              video changes to footage of an auction featuring cigar boxes signed by Castro and
              dated March 3, 2000. At minute 27:35 footage changes to an event calling for the
              return of Elián González. The event features González's father Juan González Quintana,
              his grandmothers, and groups of school children performing Cuban songs and dances.</p>

            <p>Baudilio Castellanos Garcia ( -2002) was a lawyer and childhood friend of Fidel
              Castro. Castellanos attended law school with Castro, and served as one of the defense
              attorneys for captured insurgents arrested for the 1953 attack of the Moncada
              Barracks. Under the Castro government, Castellanos directed the National Institute of
              Tourism and served as Cuban Ambassador to France.</p>

            <p>In this portion of an interview with Baudillo Castellanos, Castellanos begins by
              speaking about his relationship with Fidel Castro prior to the revolution. He
              discusses Castro's first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart, and Castro's political activism prior
              to the revolution. The bulk of the interview focuses on Castellanos work representing
              Castro, and the other revolutionaries who were arrested after their attack on the
              Moncada Barracks. He discusses speaking with Díaz-Balart following the attack, and his
              legal representation of Raúl Castro prior to Fidel's capture. He also discusses the
              role of Marta Rojas who reported on the trials of the rebels captured at Moncada. At
              minute 22:44 Castellanos looks through photographs he saved from that period, and an
              image of Raúl Castro can be seen at the top of the stack. The video quality at the end
              of the recording is poor.</p>

              concern for Fidel and Raúl, specifically citing their imprisonment following the
              attack on the Moncada barracks and their exile in Mexico. She also discusses the

            <p>This interview with Angela Castro begins with a discussion about Alina Fernández
              Revuelta, Fidel Castro's eldest daughter. Castro contends that she does not believe
              Revuelta is her brother's daughter, but notes that he has never denied paternity. She
              also discusses her sister Juana Castro, who opposed her brother's politics and moved
              to the United States. Later in the interview Castro speaks about the impact the Cuban
              Revolution had on her life and her experience of having Fidel Castro as both a brother
              and a president. She also addresses criticism that her children received preferential
              treatment because Castro was their uncle.</p>

            <p>This interview features French actor Gerard Depardieu. Depardieu discusses his
              impression of Fidel Castro as a leader, and talks about meeting him on three different
              occasions. He notes that he felt a close connection to Castro, and says that he saw a
              kinship between himself as an artist and Castro as a political revolutionary.
              Depardieu ends the interview by wishing Castro a happy 70th birthday, and speculates
              about what the future will be like for Castro and Cuba.</p>

            <p>In this interview Estela Bravo asks Marshall Frady about people's criticism of Fidel
              Castro for human rights abuses in Cuba. Frady argues that many of the negative
              reactions against Castro were formed during the Cold War, and that much of the
              antipathy directed at Castro formed as a result of decades of poor diplomatic
              relations between Cuba and the United States. The bulk of the interview focuses on
              popular perceptions of Fidel Castro, in which Frady describes him as a figure that
              inspired passionate reactions, both positive and negative. The interview is in
              English.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with Miami radio host Tomás García Fusté. The video
              begins with footage of images in Fusté's office and an interview that starts at minute
              5:30. Fusté begins by speculating about end of the Castro presidency, which he
              predicts will occur within a year of the time in which the interview was conducted. He
              also talks about his family members still living in Cuba, and the state of the
              country. He discusses Cuban exiles who have attempted to reach the US by raft or in
              the Mariel Boatlift, and blames Castro for the tragedies that had have happened as a
              result of people fleeing the country. Finally, Fusté discusses other anti-Castro
              Cubans in the United States including Orlando Bosch and Jorge Mas Canosa.</p>

            <p>This video features footage of Elián González in Cuba. The video begins with extended
              footage of González arriving in Cuba with his father. As he and his father depart from
              the plane they are greeted by large crowds and a group of relatives including
              González's grandparents. The video then cuts to footage of crowds lining the street as
              González rides home. The video also features footage of Elián González at the beach
              with his family, going to school, and ends with footage of him reading <emph

            <p>This video begins with a brief discussion with one of Fidel Castro's university
              classmates about a 1980 reunion between Castro and his friends from the University of
              Havana. The brief footage focuses on a photograph from the event. At minute 3:35 the
              video changes to an interview with Manuel González Corrales. He discusses his memories
              of Fidel Castro at the University of Havana and their shared involvement in student
              activism. He describes the political environment within the university as a microcosm
              and training ground for the revolutionary movements that developed in Cuba, and later
              discusses the assassination of Student Federation leader Manolo Castro.</p>

            <p>Alfredo Guevara Valdes (1925-2013) was a lifelong friend of Fidel Castro. They were
              students at the University of Havana, where Guevara was a member of the Communist
              Youth organization. After the Cuban revolution, Guevara became vice minister of
              Culture and established the Cuban Institute for Arts and Cinematography (I.C.A.I.C.),
              which sponsored Cuba's state-funded cinema. After leaving the ICAIC 1982, he spent
              nine years as Cuban ambassador to the United Nations educational, scientific and
              cultural organization (UNESCO).</p>

            <p>Aleida Guevara March (1960- ) is the eldest daughter of four children born to Ernesto
              "Che" Guevara and his second wife, Aleida March. A medical doctor, Guevara is based at
              the William Soler Children's Hospital in Havana and has also worked as a physician in
              Angola, Ecuador, and Nicaragua.</p>

            <p>In this interview Aleida Guevara begins with a discussion about her earliest memories
              of Fidel Castro. She then discusses Castro asking her to write a prolog for a book
              about her father, Ernesto "Che" Guevara, and his role supporting the unsuccessful
              revolution in Congo. She describes her enjoyment writing the prolog because it allowed
              her to revisit positive memories of her father. She also describes Castro's
              relationship with Guevara, and how Castro convinced him to return to Cuba briefly
              before he left to support guerilla forces in Bolivia. In the last half of the
              interview, she reads from the letter Castro wrote to her father convincing him to
              return to Cuba.</p>

            <p>This tape includes a partial interview with Cuban historian Eusebio Leal, and begins
              part way through the interview. Leal discusses the relationship between Fidel Castro
              and his brother Raúl, which he describes as one of extreme confidence and closeness.
              Leal also describes the relationship between Castro and other prominent individuals in
              Cuba including Che Guevara, Celia Sanchez, Carlos Rafael Rodríguez, Conchita
              Fernandez, and Baudillo Castellano. Finally, he discusses Castro as a polarizing
              figure and talks about the opposition of many Cubans to his leadership. The last two
              minutes of the video feature background footage of Leal walking through a
              courtyard.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with Max Lesnik. Lesnik begins by discussing student
              activism at the University of Havana and clashes with Fulgencio Batista's government.
              He later discusses Fidel Castro's relationship with his first wife Mirta Díaz-Balart.
              He later describes Fidel's interest weapons and military action, and describes how the
              beginnings of Castro's coalition grew out of a militant faction he developed within
              the Partido Ortodoxo (Orthodox Party). Lesnik details Castro's personality as a young
              man and suggests that peers viewed him as audacious and likely to achieve prominence.
              He later addresses a question about racism and notes that as a Jewish man he did face
              some racism in Cuba, but argues that the generation that he and Castro were a part of
              held much less prejudice.</p>

            <p>This video features a segment of an interview with Father Armando Llorente. In the
              interview Llorente introduces himself, and begins by discussing how he and several
              other Jesuit priests traveled from Spain to Cuba in 1942 to teach in Cuban schools. He
              explains that he was placed in el Colegio de Belen, where he met Fidel Castro who was
              a student at the school. He discusses what Castro was like as a student and an
              athlete, and describes him as particularly diligent. He shares a long anecdote about
              Castro's interest in basketball, and also talks about Castro's interest in other
              sports including soccer, baseball, and track.</p>

            <p>In this portion of an interview the Father Armando Llorente, Llorente shares
              anecdotes about Fidel Castro when he was a student at el Colegio Belen. He first
              shares a story about a time Castro saved him while they were trying to cross a
              flooding river during a school camping trip. He then talks about an incident when
              Castro was almost expelled because he refused reveal the location of two missing
              classmates to the school's rector. Llorente explains that the students had left school
              in the immediate aftermath of Pearl Harbor to volunteer to fight in World War II, and
              Castro had promised to keep their decision secret. Finally, he looks through a
              yearbook from Colegio Belen, and points out a description about Castro in the
              yearbook.</p>

              <p>The footage begins with a 14-minute interview with Wayne Smith followed by almost
                four minutes of still photos, first of Fidel Castro and Smith, then followed by what
                appear to be photos in George McGovern's office, including photos of McGovern with
                Bill Clinton and with Castro. At around 18 minutes, the interview with McGovern
                begins.</p>
              <p>George McGovern speaks in the interview about his first speech in the Senate (1963)
                on the subject of US-Cuba relations and his continued support for normalization. He
                talks about his initial meeting with Fidel in 1975, which lasted fourteen hours over
                the course two days. He later discusses the powerful influence the Miami Cuban
                community holds in respect to American foreign policy toward Cuba.</p>

            <p>This video features a brief interview with Guatemalan human rights activist Rigoberta
              Menchu. Menchu discusses the way people in the third world and Latin America view
              Fidel Castro, and explains that many see him as a symbol of resistance against
              imperialism. She discusses the cold or distant reception Castro has received from
              politicians in the United States over the years. She explains that although political
              and business leaders largely oppose his presidency, opinions about Castro, even in the
              United States, are very diverse.</p>

            <p>Gianni Mina is an Italian journalist, writer and tv host who interviewed Fidel Castro
              in 1987. Excerpts of his interview with Castro were published in his book <emph

            <p>This video contains an interview with Italian journalist Gianni Mina. Mina begins by
              discussing his background and personal history. He describes his early interest in
              sports journalism, and later becoming interested in politics after meeting exiled
              Brazilian youth living in Italy. He describes traveling to Brazil with friends and
              meeting Latin American intellectuals including Gabriel García Márquez. He later
              discusses an attempt to interview Fidel Castro at a boxing match in Monaco. He
              describes interviewing Castro 13 years after his initial attempt, and credits Márquez
              with facilitating the interview. He describes his interview with Castro in which they
              discussed Cuban human rights, scientific research, and the death of Che Guevara. The
              video contains frequent background noise, which makes some of the interview difficult
              to hear in places.</p>

            <p>This interview with Gianni Mina begins with a discussion about Fidel Castro's
              relationship with Che Guevara. Mina explains that Castro only discussed his
              professional relationship with Guevara, and notes that Castro expressed his
              disagreement with Guevara's decisions to support revolutionary movements in the third
              world. In particular he noted that Castro thought Guevara was impatient in his efforts
              to support revolutionary movements in Bolivia. The second half of the interview
              focuses on Castro's meeting with Pope John Paul II. Mina discusses the reasons he
              thought the two men sought the meeting, and what each gained from the encounter. The
              video ends with a discussion about the role of the Catholic church in Latin
              America.</p>

            <p>The first 15 minutes of the video features shots of photographs and ephemera
              pertaining to Fidel Castro, including a magazine interview of Castro, Lee Lockwood's
              book/magazine cover, and a telegram from Castro to Lockwood. Parts of the video's
              first 15 minutes have no audio or video. The rest of the video contains out-of-sync
              footage from an interview with Representative Joseph Moakley. He discusses his first
              meeting with Castro, his visit to Cuba, and his views on the United States' foreign
              policy with Cuba, with particular emphasis on the US embargo of Cuba.</p>

            <p>In this interview Luis Ortega largely discusses the relationship between Cuba and the
              United States. He argues that what Cuba needs most is not internal political reform,
              but rather a change in the United States foreign policy toward Cuba. He argues that
              the United States needs to respect Cuban sovereignty by lifting the blockade and
              improving diplomatic relations with the Cuban government. Ortega states that he does
              not think Castro believes in Communism, but rather adopted the political structure in
              opposition to the United States. He suggests that by aligning with the Soviet Union
              Castro hoped avoid a US funded coup similar to the overthrow of Jacobo Árbenz in
              Guatemala. At the end of the interview he discusses his writing career and how his
              opinions toward Cuba have changed over the years.</p>

            <p>In this video Estela Bravo interviews journalist Luis Ortega about anti-Castro
              sentiment in Miami and the custody fight over Elián González. Ortega speaks primarily
              about Cuban exiles in Miami and the strong anti-Castro sentiment that exists in the
              city. He discusses US policy toward Cuba, criticizing aggressive US foreign policy and
              the trade embargo. He also discusses criticism of Cuba for political repression and
              its single party system, and the US government's response to human rights concerns in
              Cuba compared to other countries. Much of the second half of the interview focuses on
              the case of Elián González and the Miami Cuban community's attempt to stop his return
              to Cuba.</p>

            <p>This video features portions of interviews with Luis Ortega and Max Lesnik. The
              interview with Ortega begins where the footage from tape ref227 ends and runs until
              minute 16:30. In this portion of the interview he discusses the Cuban community in
              Miami, and the polarized opinions about Fidel Castro that the community holds. He also
              talks about the custody battle over Elián González and the image of Fidel Castro as a
              figure of anti-imperialism in Latin American. At minute 16:31 the footage changes to
              an interview with Max Lesnik. Lesnik describes his acquaintance with Castro at the
              University of Havana, where they were classmates. Lesnik discusses Castro's politics
              during that era, and the inspiration Castro drew from the political leader Eduardo
              Chibás and the writings of José Martí. The video quality is poor during portions of
              this interview.</p>

              Minister P.J. Patterson welcomes Castro to the city. Patterson delivers a speech

              bonds between Cuba and Jamaica caused by their shared history of colonization and
              plantation society, and pledges to help Cuba improve its relationship in the western
              hemisphere.</p>

            <p>This video features portions of an interview with Abel Prieto. In the interview
              Prieto discusses Fidel Castro's interest in studying prominent historical figures like
              Napoleon and Churchill as well as the history of indigenous peoples and the working
              class. Prieto discusses his experience traveling internationally with Castro, and the
              positive and negative perceptions of Castro in the world. He describes Castro as a
              polarizing figure and talks about perceptions of Castro in Florida, and Miami in
              particular. Prieto also describes Castro's competitive spirit, and in the second half
              of the interview he discusses what he thinks Cuba will look like after Castro's
              presidency. He discusses his optimism for the future of Cuba after Castro, citing
              strong party unity and active participation from young voters. He also talks about
              Cuba moving toward a new kind of socialism.</p>

              and her admiration for Cuban President Fidel Castro. She discusses her experience
              meeting Castro on several occasions and explains that her mother gave her the name
              "Fidelia" because she was a supporter of the revolution. She discusses traveling
              internationally and American athletes' misconceptions about life in Cuba. Finally, she
              shares her belief that Cuba will continue as a socialist nation. The end of the video

            <p>This video features footage of former U.S. Representative Charles Rangel in his
              office speaking with Estela Bravo. The video begins during the final minutes of a
              formal interview, but the bulk of the video features Rangel and Bravo speaking
              informally. Rangel shares a few stories about his political relationship with the
              Catholic Church. Other footage includes Rangel making phone calls and shots of
              photographs in his office.</p>

            <p>This video features an interview with <emph render="italic">Cigar Aficionado</emph>
              publisher Marvin Shanken. In the interview Shanken describes meeting Fidel Castro and
              interviewing him for an article in the magazine. He briefly describes the events that
              led to his meeting with Castro and his importance as a symbol in the cigar industry.
              He discusses the US embargo on Cuba and its effects on the cigar industry, and
              expresses his hope that then US president Bill Clinton would lift the embargo. The
              bulk of the interview focuses on Shanken's impression of Castro as a person and a
              leader. The end features footage of a humidor Shanken received from Castro as a gift
              and photographs of Castro published in <emph render="italic">Cigar

            <p>In this interview Stanley Sheinbaum begins by introducing himself, his work as an
              economist, and his path to political activism following the Vietnam War. He discusses
              his personal background including his work organizing the Pentagon Papers defense for
              Daniel Ellsberg, organizing the American Civil Liberties Union in Los Angeles, and
              serving as Los Angeles Police Commissioner. He then discusses his political
              connections with Democratic politicians George McGovern and Bill Clinton. The bulk of
              the interview focuses on Sheinbaum's travels to Cuba and his interest in the Cuban
              community in Miami. He discusses the politics of the Miami Cuban community, and at the
              end of the video discusses his meeting with Cuban politician Ricardo Alarcón, and

            <p>This video contains an interview with Stanley Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum talks about
              meeting Fidel Castro and his impression of Castro as a political leader, which he
              contrasts with his experience meeting Syrian leader Bashar al Assad. Filmed sometime
              between 1995 and 1996, Sheinbaum discusses the passage of the Helm-Burton Act by the
              US Congress, and speculates about impact of the upcoming 1996 elections on US policy
              toward Cuba. He addresses the criticism and admiration of Castro, and compares
              Castro's government with Cuba under the presidency of Fulgencio Batista. He also
              discusses a potential meeting between Castro and President Bill Clinton, but suggests
              that such a meeting would be contingent on the political situation in the United
              States. The end of the interview features still images of Sheinbaum with both Castro
              and Clinton.</p>

              human rights violations in Cuba. At minute 30:35 the video switches to footage of a

            <p>This tape contains a 30-minute interview between Estela Bravo and Ted Turner in
              Atlanta. The initial 14 minutes involve Bravo showing Turner old footage to refresh
              his memory of his past visits to Cuba. The remainder of the interview involves Turner
              responding to questions and talking about Fidel Castro, and his views on normalizing
              relations with Cuba.</p>

            <p>Angel Fernandez Varela a teacher of Fidel Castro's who taught at the Belen Jesuit
              Preparatory School in Havana. An opponent of the Castro government, he was recruited
              by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). According to his son, Alvaro Fernandez,
              Valrela had been one of the CIA agents who secretly introduced among the Cuban
              population a false decree stating that they would lose parental authority, leading to
              Operation Peter Pan in the 1960s.</p>

            <p>In this portion of an interview Angel Fernandez Varela, Varela discusses the
              anti-Fidelista sentiment in Miami, and the way the opinions about Castro have changed
              in the Miami Cuban community. He suggests that anti-Fidelistas are still the majority
              in Miami, but those in favor of Castro are increasing. He addresses criticism of
              Castro as a dictator, and contends that he does not consider dictators frightening. He
              also discusses returning to Cuba in 1993. He describes meeting Castro again, and
              describes their meeting as amiable. In the second half of the interview Estela Bravo
              shares a yearbook from Colegio de Belén during the years when he was a teacher of
              Fidel Castro. Varela looks through the yearbook and shares stories about students and
              his memories at the school.</p>

              by how many white men held positions of power and the government's treatment of gays.
              She later discusses meeting Fidel Castro on subsequent trips to Cuba with delegations
              brining medical supplies.</p>

            <p>This video features part of an interview with author Alice Walker. Walker discusses
              her memories of Castro's 1995 speech at Riverside Church in Harlem, and her experience
              meeting Castro in person. She addresses American media portrayals of Castro as a
              dictator, which she says contrasts with her perception of him. Walker also discusses
              Castro's knowledge of agricultural issues, and concludes that his longevity as a
              leader in Cuba comes from the support he has from many Cuban citizens. The end of the
              video features still images of Walker with Castro and during her travels in Cuba.</p>

              minister Lucius Walker, leader of Pastors for Peace who organized the caravan. Walker
              begins by celebrating the contributions of aid from Americans opposed to the US trade
              embargo against Cuba. Walker describes the extent of aid and provides some explanation
              the purpose of the aid and how it will be distributed. Also featured in the press
              conference is Andres Gomez of Antonio Maceo Brigades, which also participated in the
              caravan.</p>

            <p>In this footage, Fidel Castro is sitting for a portrait on his 70th birthday. This
              lengthy footage consists primarily of Castro speaking about a variety of subjects. It
              also features footage of news photographers, including Estela Bravo, to whom he
              appears to be speaking. He talks about his recent trip to the United States, describes
              an event where Yasser Arafat was asked to leave Lincoln Center, and talks about how he
              would have reacted if he been asked to leave. As the footage progresses, it is
              possible to see the progress of the portrait.</p>

            <p>This video features clips of Fidel Castro at several public events filmed around the
              year 2000. The majority of the clips feature rallies and town meetings in Cuba calling
              for the return of Elian González. Castro does not speak in any of the clips, but can
              be seen greeting crowds. In one section he speaks to González's father Juan Miguel
              González Quintana, but cannot be heard due to poor audio quality. Other clips feature
              Castro touring a Cuban medical school with American reporter Andrea Mitchell, and
              clips included at the end of the tape feature Castro greeting crowds during his
              travels to other countries.</p>

            <p>This video features the first portion of a speech by Fidel Castro to the South
              African parliament in Cape Town, South Africa. Castro begins speaking around minute
              5:00. He begins by offering his support and hope for the creation of a new South
              Africa led by Nelson Mandela, and commends Mandela for his commitment to justice
              following the end of the apartheid system. Castro calls for an end to divisions on the
              basis of race, and encourages South Africa and its political leaders to seek to
              address problems in economic inequality. He discusses the history of colonialism,
              which led to slavery and exploitation across the globe, expresses his hope that the
              new South African government will serve as an example of how to break free from the
              legacy of that system. Audio quality of this video is poor in places.</p>

            <p>This video begins with on-the-street interviews in Soweto, South Africa with
              individuals gathered in anticipation of a visit by Fidel Castro. Interviewees explain
              why they are excited to see Fidel Castro, and several express their gratitude for
              Cuba's support of the fight against the apartheid government. The footage then changes
              to show Castro's arrival. The end of the video provides approximately 10 minutes of a
              rally honoring Castro. The speakers welcome Cuban and South African leaders and affirm
              the friendship between the two nations. Speakers also celebrate the memory of the
              Cuban revolution and Cuba's role in supporting democracy in South Africa.</p>

            <p>This video largely features Nelson and Winnie Mandela greeting world leaders and
              delegates at the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Durban, South Africa. Mandela can be
              seen greeting several prominent individuals including Yasser Arafat and Fidel Castro.
              At minute 18:04 the video features portions of Mandela's speech, which appears to have
              been recorded from a television screen or projector. The speech is not complete, but
              in it, Mandela speaks about the need for developed countries to commit to supporting
              those that are less developed. He specifically calls for the United Nations to support
              the people in Angola and Sudan.</p>

            <p>This video features a speech by Fidel Castro at the Non-Aligned Movement Summit in
              Durban, South Africa. Castro begins by thanking the leaders of the South African
              government, and calls for reforms with the United Nations to provide greater
              representation of countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He specifically calls
              for an expansion of the Security Council and an end to permanent membership. He
              likewise criticizes the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, both of which he
              argues disproportionately benefit wealthy nations, and the United States in
              particular. In his speech Castro also criticizes wealthy nations development and sales
              of weapons, lack of respect for the environment, and displacement of people in the
              third world.</p>

            <p>This video features a series of clips of South African president Nelson Mandela
              visiting Cuba. The video begins with footage of Mandela arriving in Cuba where he is
              greeted by Fidel Castro. The bulk features Mandela and Castro at addressing crowds
              across Cuba, but does not contain any complete speeches. Much of the audio captured in
              these clips features informal discussions between the two leaders as they travel to
              different venues. Footage at the end of the video features Fidel Castro during a visit
              to South Africa, and ends with a segment of footage shot sometime earlier in which
              Mandela asks Castro to visit South Africa.</p>

            <p>This video features a small portion of a speech by Fidel Castro at a ceremony
              celebrating the opening of Mandela Park in Kingston, Jamaica in 1998. Castro discusses
              European tourism, and argues that development of Jamaican tourism does not compete
              with tourist economies of other Caribbean nations, but rather represents a good sign
              for Caribbean tourism in general. Castro is then presented with the gift of a book by
              Jamaican spelling bee champion Jody-Anne Maxwell.</p>

            <p>This video features the end of a speech by Fidel Castro in Mandela Park in Kingston,
              Jamaica. In this portion of the speech Castro discusses the need for Caribbean
              solidarity as a way to promote education and economic development in the region. He
              also calls for a greater dedication to the preservation of natural resources,
              protection of the environment, and support of neighbors after natural disasters such
              as hurricanes. At the end of the speech Castro is presented with a gift to thank him
              for visiting the city.</p>

              Fidel Castro. In a series of brief interviews Estela Bravo asks individuals why they
              have come to see Castro speak and their opinions about him as a leader. Many express

            <p>This video features footage of crowds in Montego Bay, Jamaica watching a speech by
              Fidel Castro. The footage focuses predominantly on individuals and their reactions to
              Castro's speech. Castro speaks in Spanish while his translator speaks in English, but
              the audio is only present in the background, while the video focuses predominantly on
              members of the crowd. The video starts and stops several times and as a result does
              not contain a complete recording of Castro's speech.</p>

            <p>This video features still images of Fidel Castro and an interview with Cuban
              revolutionary Lionel Soto. The first 10 minutes features shots of still images of
              Castro with members of his family, including his oldest brother Ramón and his mother
              Lina Ruz González. Later photos feature Castro speaking to Cuban dancer Alicia Alonso
              after one of her performances. At minute 10:10 the video changes to an interview with
              Lionel Soto. Soto speaks about his memories of Castro and the student activist
              movement at the University of Havana. He describes student activism in period leading
              up to the Cuban revolution and Castro's role as a leader of that movement.</p>

            <p>This video features footage of Fidel Castro's 2000 visit to the Riverside Church in
              the Harlem. The footage begins with a short speech by Bronx Congressman Jose Serrano
              welcoming Castro the New York City. The first 14-minutes feature individuals welcoming
              Castro and the crowd cheering for him and singing "Happy Birthday." At minute 14:30
              Castro addresses the crowd and thanks them for their hospitality. He discusses his
              previous visits to New York City, and talks about several social issues like the
              blockade against Cuba, and maternal deaths and child malnutrition in the third
              world.</p>

            <p>This video features the continuation of Fidel Castro's speech at Riverside Church in
              Harlem. In this portion of the speech Castro discusses the trade embargo and the
              effect it has had on Cuba's ability to obtain food and medicine. He also criticizes
              the globalized banking system and the problem of professionals from the third world
              moving to richer nations. He discusses Cuban solidarity with third world nations in
              Latin America and Africa, and praises the quality education and medical care in Cuba.

            <p>This video features footage from Fidel Castro's visit to the Riverside Church in
              Harlem in the year 2000. The bulk of the video features footage of the crowd waiting
              for Castro's arrival. At minute 1:55 Estela Bravo briefly interviews Bronx Congressman
              Jose Serrano about his opinions of Castro and the reason the crowd at the church is
              eager to hear him speak. At minute 10:16 the footage changes to an interview with an
              American diplomat who was part of the negotiations to return Elian González to Cuba.
              She talks about Castro as a negotiator and her perceptions of working with him on the
              González case. The footage also shows Fidel Castro arriving at the church and brief
              welcoming statements from various speakers.</p>

              Harlem. In this segment he thanks the American people who called for Elián González's
              return to Cuba, and those who protested legislation strengthening the trade embargo
              against Cuba. Castro then speaks about inequality and marginalization, which he
              acknowledges continues to exist in Cuba, and pledges his commitment to ending poor
              housing conditions and raising standards of living. Finally, he talks at length about
              what he viewed as overblown news coverage of his handshake with American President
              Bill Clinton, explaining that it lasted only a brief moment and the two men were
              simply trying to be polite.</p>

              congressional representatives introducing the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity
              Act, later called the Helms-Burton Act. Senator Jesse Helms of South Carolina
              introduces the act and the goals of the legislation. Helms expresses his hope that the
              bill will lead to an end of Fidel Castro's leadership in Cuba and lead the country on
              a path away from communism. Co-author of the bill, Representative Dan Burton from
              Indiana speaks next and outlines the provisions of the bill, which places restrictions
              on U.S. trading partners who seek to trade with Cuba. Burton stresses the bi-partisan
              support for the bill and the stated goal of hastening the end of Fidel Castro's
              control in Cuba. Other speakers include representatives who contributed to the bill
              Lincoln Díaz-Balart, Bob Menendez, and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.</p>

            <p>Much of the footage was filmed in Chile and Colombia. It contains an assortment of
              clips including: Castro meeting Latin American presidents; Gabriel García Márquez and
              his wife Mercedes; Castro speaking about inequality and justice; footage of Robert
              McNamara, Castro, and Jorge Risquet joking with each other around 00:27:00; a speech
              by Castro; and a celebration of Castro's birthday on plane. At 00:38:00 there is
              footage of a meeting in preparation for Pope's visit to Cuba. In another clip, Castro
              shows a set of Russian dolls and boxing puppets of himself and Bill Clinton, and
              around 00:56:00 there is a clip of a visit by Mohammed Ali and the Cuban boxer,
              Teofilo Stevenson. The sound drops out in intermittently throughout the video.</p>

            <p>This tape contains over an hour of very old clips and footage. The first 8-minute
              segment is from Edward R. Murrow's <emph render="italic">Person to Person</emph>
              television show with Fidel Castro and his son Fidelito. The footage that follows
              includes grainy clips of Havana after Batista fled Cuba and several shots of tourists
              leaving the country. These clips are mostly black and white and in some places there
              is no sound. Most are in Spanish, but there is a small amount of narration in English.
              There are also shots of enthusiastic crowds as Castro and his entourage travel through
              the countryside and into Havana. Some footage appears to have been shot in Harlem
              during Fidel's visit to the United Nations.</p>

            <p>This short clip features footage of Fidel Castro speaking to a group of people at a
              reception. Most of the people speak in English and Castro speaks to them through a
              translator. He engages in discussions with several individuals on a variety of topics
              including US trade, production of goods, and agriculture and the use of pesticides. In
              the second part of the clip Castro speaks to an older man about his approach to public
              speaking and the ways he tries to connect with the crowd.</p>

            <p>This video features Cuban television footage about the life of Ernesto "Che" Guevara,
              and the Cuban Missile Crisis. The first 35 minutes of the tape feature a program
              titled "Cuando pienso en el Che," in which Fidel Castro shares his memories of
              Guevara. Castro speaks about Guevara's role during the Cuban Revolution, his work in
              the Cuban government, and his pursuit of revolutionary movements in Africa and Latin
              America. Beginning at minute 35:45 the tape changes to footage of Cuban news reports
              and historical footage from the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs invasion.</p>

            <p>This video features a speech by Fidel Castro at the Parliament of South Africa. The
              beginning of the video begins with representatives entering the chamber and welcoming
              Castro. Portions of this speech are duplicated on the video ref150. Duplicated content
              runs approximately from minute 12:00 to 41:00. After minute 41:00 Castro continues
              speaking about the potential of African youth and stresses Cuba's history of
              solidarity with African nations and the third world. He addresses challenges facing
              Africa like deforestation, desertification, and HIV/AIDS. The end of the video focuses
              on speculative investment and the United States economy, in which Castro criticizes
              the US for artificially inflating its currency. Video and audio quality of this
              recording is very poor.</p>

            <p>This video features footage of Fidel Castro at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in
              Harlem in 1995. The footage largely consists of shots of the crowd chanting " Cuba Sí,
              Bloqueo No," and some notable individuals can be seen in the crowd including Angela
              Davis and Ricardo Alarcón. The video contains several segments of speakers welcoming
              Castro to Harlem, but much of the footage of the speakers is cut short. The end of the
              recording shows Castro leaving the church and greeting the crowd.</p>

            <p>This video features a portion of a speech by Fidel Castro's at the Abyssinian Baptist
              Church in Harlem, NY. The footage begins part-way through Castro's speech. He
              describes his decision to wear his military fatigues in Harlem, the unwelcoming
              reception he received from New York's political leaders, and the need to end the
              blockade on Cuba. He also talks about Cuba's support of independence struggles in
              Angola and South Africa, and the United Nations lack of recognition for their support.
              After Castro's speech concludes, footage shows him leaving the church and greeting
              members of the crowd.</p>

            <p>This video features clips of demonstrations celebrating Fidel Castro and Cuba, and
              others featuring anti-Castro rallies. Rallies featured in this footage were filmed in
              Uruguay, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and New York City. Many demonstrations coincided
              with a visit by Castro to these locations, and Castro appears in some of the footage.
              The bulk of the footage features sweeping views of the crowds, but some segments also
              contain brief on-the-street interviews with participants.</p>

            <p>This video features portions of a television program about the Cuban Revolution. It
              begins by describing the political and economic climate of Cuba prior to the
              revolution. The program then details events of the revolution, including the siege on
              the Moncada barracks, Castro's invasion from Mexico, and the revolutionaries in the
              Sierra Maestra. It then discusses Cuban life and government after the revolution, and
              describes events leading up to the Bay of Pigs invasion. The program is narrated in
              English, but is told from a Cuban perspective. The video does not contain a complete
              version of the program and starts and stops in various places.</p>

            <p>This video contains footage of Fidel Castro at the home of Ecuadorian painter Oswaldo
              Guayasamín. The beginning of the video features Castro speaking with Guayasamín in his
              studio as he works on a portrait of Castro. Subsequent footage features Castro
              speaking with several individuals, including Estela Bravo, about food and cooking in
              the kitchen of Guayasamín's home. The bulk of the footage, beginning at minute 33:00,
              features Fidel speaking to the group about religion, nationalism, and the market
              economy. He talks in particular about Catholicism and his perception of religion as a
              vehicle to acquire power. Castro also discusses his memories of the events of the
              Cuban Revolution.</p>

            <p>This video is comprised of three different segments of Cuban State Council footage.
              The first clip includes on-the-street footage of overcrowded buses in Havana, and
              people waiting in long bus lines. The clips show footage of people on bicycles, and a
              few cars driving by on the streets. At minute 6:10 the video switches to footage of
              Fidel Castro on a visit to Vietnam. This footage does not have any sound, but shows
              Castro meeting state leaders and shaking hands with groups of people. At minute 7:41
              the tape switches to older black and white footage of a hurricane and rescue efforts
              to help Cuban communities affected by flooding and storm damage.</p>

            <p>This video features an assortment of video segments recorded around the year 2000.
              The first clip briefly shows footage of Elián González receiving a book signed by
              Fidel Castro, the second features Castro walking in a parade, and the next features
              part of a speech by US Representative Maxine Waters welcoming Castro to New York City.
              At minute 7:28 the video switches to footage of an interview with Arthur Strimling. In
              the interview, Strimling talks about watching Castro speak in Harlem in 1959. He
              describes the crowds who gathered to see Castro and the reception Castro received from
              the media and political leaders. Strimling also talks about how his views on Castro
              changed over the years. He explains that although he has admiration for the economic
              revolution in Cuba, he is troubled by the country's human rights abuses and repression
              of political opposition.</p>

            <p>This video features a speech by Fidel Castro at the 17th Congress of the Workers
              Central Union of Cuba or Central de Trabajadores de Cuba (CTC). The footage does not
              contain a complete reporting of the speech, but rather starts and stops several times
              to focus on the crowd. Large portions of the speech can be heard in which Castro
              lectures on the virtues of socialism and the power of unity among the working class.
              He also criticizes the United States focusing on its foreign policy, treatment of the
              poor, and consumer capitalism.</p>

            <p>This video features on-the-street interviews with people in Havana, Cuba. In these
              interviews Estela Bravo asks people what they think the future holds for Cuba. She
              specifically asks if they think Cuba will remain a socialist country, and whether they
              believe the Cuban government will retain power after Fidel Castro's leadership ends.
              The majority express their belief that Cuban government will remain intact.
              Individuals on the street also discuss their opinions about the Cuba socialism, and
              the reasons they have stayed in the country when many others have left.</p>

          <p>Released in 1993, <emph render="italic">Flotilla to Cuba</emph> shows a fleet of small
            vessels setting out from Key West, Florida, to Cuba, carrying food and medicine in a
            humanitarian gesture sponsored by US citizens. The film shows the flotilla's arrival in
            Cuba and the distribution of its cargo to hospitals in Havana, but also reveals
            divisions within the Cuban community in Florida. This series contains a full-length
            documentary, as well as raw footage of the flotilla.</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview with a mother and daughter in Key West, Florida
              preparing medical supplies to send in a 1993 humanitarian flotilla to Cuba. The mother
              and daughter discuss their reasons for supporting the flotilla and express their
              frustration at the people opposing it. They criticize the United States embargo
              against Cuba, and contend the that flotilla is a matter of human rights not politics.
              The video then shows footage of people loading a boat with supplies. At minute 14:10,
              Bravo interviews a group of people opposing the flotilla who argue that the goods will
              be taken by the Cuban government and sold to tourists. They express their doubt that
              the Cuban people will receive the goods, and instead express their fear that Castro
              will use the aid to control the people.</p>

            <p>This video documents the arrival of a flotilla of supplies in Cuba. It begins with an
              interview with the crew of one of the boats who talk about the rough waters on their
              journey across the Strait of Florida. The footage then changes to a larger ship of
              supplies being unloaded onto a Red Cross truck. It features an interview with one of
              the Red Cross organizers as well as an organizer from the Key West-based group Basta.
              The end of video features a second interview with the spokesman from Basta at a
              children's hospital where many of the supplies were delivered. He explains that the
              purpose of the event at the hospital is to prove that the supplies are being delivered
              directly to the people.</p>

          <p>Subtitled "A History of 25 Years of Travel Restrictions," the 33-minute film <emph
              render="italic">Free to Fly: The US-Cuba Link</emph> tells the story of efforts to
            maintain links between the Cuban and American people. Also documented are the activities
            of many of the anti-Castro groups in Florida and in New Jersey who violently opposed
            travel between the United States and Cuba. Appearing in the film are US politicians
            including Republican Senator and former Representative from Arizona Jeff Flake;
            Republican former Senator and Representative from Idaho, Larry Craig; Democratic former
            Representative from Massachusetts, Bill Delahunt; and Democratic Massachusetts
            Representative, Jim McGovern. In the documentary they contend that travel between the
            countries builds openness and understanding; strengthens family ties; fosters cultural
            exchange, tourism and trade; and is a constitutional right for all Americans. No raw
            footage associated with the film is available. Only a completed version of the
            documentary is included in this series.</p>

          <p>Estela Bravo's 1987 film <emph render="italic">Holy Father and Gloria</emph>
            <emph render="italic">El Santo Padre y la Gloria</emph> won many awards including Best
            Documentary on Current Affairs at the San Francisco International Film Festival; Gold
            Plaque Award at the Chicago International Film Festival; and Best Documentary at the
            American Film Institute Global Village Festival in New York.</p>
          <p>Carmen Gloria Quintana Arancibia (1968- ) is a Chilean woman who became a symbol of
            hope for democracy in Chile to many Chileans after she received an embrace and
            encouragement from Pope John Paul II in 1987. On July 2,1986, Quintana, along with a
            young photographer, Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, were participating in a student
            protest in Santiago. They were attacked and beaten by a patrol of military police,
            soaked with gasoline, and set on fire. De Negri died of his burns. Gloria suffered
            second and third degree burns over 62% of her body; she was critically ill and was moved
            to a hospital in Canada. Although she survived, Gloria was badly disfigured from her
            burns. When the Pope visited Chile in 1987, she returned and was able to meet with the
            pontiff in Santiago.</p>

          <p>The 43-minute documentary <emph render="italic">Holy Father and Gloria</emph> (<emph
              render="italic">El Santo Padre y la Gloria</emph>) was released in 1987 and captures
            the turbulence of Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship. It traces the story of Carmen
            Gloria Quintana and her 1987 journey back to Chile to see the Pope. In addition to
            footage of the Pope's visit and the ongoing protests the documentary includes interviews
            with Quintana and many others. Among the voices captured are those of elites,
            particularly young people, who supported the Pinochet government and felt the protests
            were unnecessary. Footage in this series includes shots of Quintana touring Chile,
            speeches by the Pope, interviews with Quintana and other Chileans, and historical
            footage contextualizing Chilean politics.</p>

            <p>This video features youth in Chile celebrating the return of Carmen Gloria Quintana,
              and a brief interview with Quintana. The first several minutes feature children
              drawing doves and other tributes to Quintana on the street. At minute 2:58 the video
              changes to an interview with Quintana. She discusses her hope of meeting with the
              Pope, and her surprise at the warm welcome she received upon her return. She says that
              she hopes to continue fighting and speaking out against the dictatorship of Augusto
              Pinochet, but acknowledges that protest is still very difficult. She also discusses a
              button featuring the Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, who died when they were both
              attacked by members of the Chilean military and burned. She explains that she hopes to
              be a representative of Rojas's memory. At minute 10:56 the footage changes to Chilean
              youths discussing a mural of Quintana and Rojas, painted at the location where they
              were attacked. A young woman and young man speak with Bravo about the significance of
              Quintana and Rojas to the youth movement in Chile.</p>

            <p>Parque O'Higgins is a public park in the center of Santiago, Chile. Pope John Paul II
              (in his 1987 visit) led a beautification ceremony for Saint Teresa of the Andes.
              Because of the violence that broke out between the Chilean police force and crowds

            <p>This video begins with footage of violent clashes between the police and protestors
              at O'Higgins Park in Santiago, Chile where Pope John Paul II delivered Mass to a large
              crowd in 1987. The footage shows protestors building makeshift barriers and throwing
              objects while police try to disperse them. The footage focuses primarily on the crowd,
              and does not show the Pope speaking, although he can be heard through a loudspeaker.
              The video features several on-the-street interviews: one with a man opposed to the
              protests, one with a local journalist, and one with a young protester. The end of this
              video also features an interview with exiled Chilean Socialist leader Clodomiro
              Almeyda. In the interview Almeyda discusses why he chose to return to Chile during the
              Pope's visit to the country.</p>

            <p>This video features interviews with three different groups of students in Chile.
              Estela Bravo asks the students, who are from middle and upper-class schools, about
              their opinions of Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, Pope John Paul II's visit, and
              the attack on Carmen Gloria Quintana. Students from the various groups express
              different opinions on these topics, and many of the students who come from upper-class
              households express their support of Pinochet. They argue that the people protesting
              his government are mistaken and supporters of terrorism. Several students express
              their admiration for Pinochet, and contend that he saved the country from communism.
              Other students express their dislike of Pinochet, and contend that the students who
              support him are uninformed and are not in a position to understand the political
              situation of the country.</p>

            <p>This video begins with footage of a mother trying to talk to Chilean police about her
              son. She explains that she heard that her son, who was 9 years old at the time the
              footage was recorded, was injured by police after they chased him into a house. The
              woman attempts to find out what happened to her son and where he was taken, but the
              police do not give her any information. The video then focuses on the house where the
              boy was attacked. The family in the house explains that they police chased the boy,
              broke down their door, and hit the young boy in the head causing him to bleed
              significantly. Several of the children and adults in the house describe witnessing the
              event. They also talk about police treatment of the poor and substandard living
              conditions in their community.</p>

            <p>Juan Pablo Letelier was the son of Orlando Letelier. Orlando Letelier was a Chilean
              diplomat under the government of Salvador Allende. He left Chile as a refugee of the
              dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, and was assassinated by Pinochet's secret police in
              Washington D.C. in 1976.</p>

            <p>This video mostly features an interview with Juan Pablo Letelier. The first few
              seconds of the video contain footage of the grave of Chilean dissident Rodrigo Andres
              Rojas de Negri. It quickly changes to an interview with Letelier, which begins with a
              discussion about his early life and his father's assassination. He discusses leaving
              Chile when he was 3 years old, and returning to Chile later in life. He also talks
              about his involvement in leftist political movements in Chile and his participations
              in Chile's Socialist Youth. He discusses the significance of the visit of Pope John
              Paul II in 1987, and the 1989 general elections. Letelier talks at length about the
              political climate in Chile at the end of the 1980s discussing the country's transition
              to democracy and the influence of youth activism. The video quality is poor in many
              places.</p>

              the attack on Carmen Gloria Quintana and Rodrigo Rojas who were burned by Chilean
              military police in 1986. The video then changes to footage of Quintana arriving at a

              anticipation of Quintana's arrival. At minute 13:00 Quintana addresses the crowd and
              describes her encounter with the military, in which she and Rojas were doused with
              gasoline and then lit on fire. At the time of her speech, she explains that it has
              been 10 months since the event and notes that she has been left badly disfigured and
              Rojas has died.</p>

            <p>The beginning of this video features an interview with a man and a woman in a church
              in Chile. They discuss their involvement in the resistance movement against the
              Pinochet government and the violence they have witnessed in the country. The interview
              focuses on the government's use of torture against citizens. The woman shares specific
              examples of torture used against Chilean citizens, discuss police interrogation
              methods, and describes the psychological effects of state-sponsored violence. At
              minute 12:00 the video features a demonstration against the government, and protestors
              can be seen clashing briefly with the police. Bravo interviews members of the crowd
              about why they are at the protest, and about their expectations for the upcoming 1987
              visit of Pope John Paul II.</p>

            <p>Jose Humberto "Pepe" Carrasco Tapia (1943-1986) was a Chilean journalist opposed to
              the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. He was assassinated on September 7,

            <p>This video features an assortment of footage filmed in Chile around 1986. It begins
              with footage of protesters clashing with military police. It then changes to shots of
              newspaper headlines announcing the arrival of socialist politician Clodomiro Almeyda.
              At minute 9:29 the footage changes to edits of a CNN Atlanta news report on the
              political climate in Chile. The footage features several segments which focus on a
              failed national strike, the death of journalist José Carrasco, and the dictatorship of
              Augusto Pinochet. After the CNN report ends the video features additional raw footage
              of protests, funerals, government events, and a short speech by Pinochet denouncing
              communists in the country. The end of the video features footage of an impoverished
              community.</p>

              She is greeted by crowds and speaks to reporters. At minute 5:00 the video changes to

              talks about being shot while photographing a demonstration. She describes the event,
              and the people who helped her immediately after she was shot. She discusses the

            <p>In this interview Uruguayan politician Jaime Perez begins by discussing his travels
              to Cuba in the early 1970s and meeting Fidel Castro. He then talks about his 10-year
              imprisonment in Uruguay by the country's military dictatorship. He describes Uruguay's
              transition to democracy and the influence of the country's foreign debt on that
              process. He explains that he is optimistic about the transition to democracy, but
              contends that the process has just begun and that the country has a long history of
              repression and disappearance of political dissidents that needs to be addressed. At
              the end of the interview he expresses his gratitude to Castro and Cuba for supporting
              the Communist Party in Uruguay and its fight against the military dictatorship.</p>

          <p>This series contains a copy of the Bravo documentary <emph render="italic">Mandel and
              Fidel</emph>, which documents the friendship between Nelson Mandela and Fidel Castro.
            No clips or raw footage associated with this film is included in the series. Instead,
            much of the footage used in this 30-minute documentary was drawn from earlier films
            including <emph render="italic">Namibia: The Last Colony</emph> (1990), <emph
              render="italic">Mandela in Cuba</emph> (1991), and <emph render="italic">Fidel The
              Untold Story</emph> (2000).</p>
          <p>The film begins with Nelson Mandela's attendance at the Namibian independence
            celebrations in March of 1990, a month following his release from prison. He meets with
            Cuban officials and expresses his gratitude for Cuba's assistance in the war in Angola
            and for its role in the Namibian war of independence. The next year Mandela visits Cuba.
            The documentary follows the relationship for several more years including Castro's
            attendance at Mandela's inauguration in 1994 and Fidel's visit to Robben Island to see
            where Mandela was imprisoned.</p>

          <p>In 1991 Nelson Mandela visited Cuba during a tour to Latin American. Then President of
            the African National Congress, Mandela used the tour to lobby countries like Brazil,
            Mexico, and Venezuela to maintain sanctions against South Africa's white minority
            government, and support a national unity government in Pretoria. Mandela made a
            three-day stop in Cuba during the tour to meet with Fidel Castro. Mandela and Castro had
            never met before the visit, but the two shared admiration for one another stemming from
            Cuba's support of Angolan and Namibian independence.</p>

              "Fidel and Mandela" although Mandela does not appear in the footage. This was possibly

            <p>The first ten minutes consists of scenes in a large chamber with no sound; Fidel
              enters and is seated. After a few minutes of test pattern, there is sound and a
              picture of the Mandelas (and Jorge Risquet) at airport boarding a plane (en route to
              Jamaica per Estela Bravo). There is sound and people speaking with each other but the
              sound of the plane engine drowns out the conversations. There are many close-ups of
              the various people in Mandela's entourage. Finally, the last few minutes return to a
              chamber filled with people but no sound.</p>

          <p>Released in 1983, <emph render="italic">The Marielitos</emph> (<emph render="italic"
              >Los Marielitos</emph>) tells the story of Cubans who left the island from the port of
            Mariel in 1980. In the documentary, Estela Bravo interviews individuals living in Miami
            who were part of the Mariel boatlift two years after their arrival in the United States.
            She talks with them about their expectations for life in the United States and their
            experiences since their arrival.</p>

          <p>In the wake of an economic downturn in 1980, approximately 10,000 Cubans tried to leave
            Cuba and seek asylum in the Peruvian embassy. As a result, the Cuban government
            announced that anyone who wanted to leave the country could do so. In a joint agreement
            between the United States and Cuba, some 125,000 refugees left the Cuban port of Mariel
            bound for the United States in what came to be known as the Mariel Boatlift. Cubans who
            traveled to the US as part of the boatlift came to be known as Marielitos.</p>
          <p>Estela Bravo's documentary about the boatlift, <emph render="italic">The
              Marielitos</emph>, won the International Organization of Journalists 1st Prize at the
            1984 Leipzig Film Festival and a Patria Society Award at the Moscow Film Festival.</p>

              discusses the impact of their separation on the family and records a response to his

              with one family awaiting a recently arrived relative from Cuba. They discuss their
              reasons for leaving Cuba and their lives in the United States. Bravo then interviews

            <p>This is footage of an on-the-street interview of three Dominicans. Estela Bravo
              speaks with them, in Spanish, about various topics including the Reagan administration
              and the experience of the Spanish-speaking population in New York. They are very
              critical of Reagan and his policies, which they call "anti-Latin." They talk about the
              economic recession in the United States, lack of representation, lack of support for
              poor communities, and the difficulty of uniting Latin Americans in the United States
              because they come from so many different countries. They address other concerns,
              including the difficulty of organizing for more rights because they are too busy
              working at low wage jobs. Bravo asks their opinions about American policies on
              Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras. They also discuss how the United States
              addresses problems such as drug addiction and violence.</p>

            <p>This tape contains brief clips from <emph render="italic">Maurice</emph> film
              premiere. Estela Bravo makes comments, answers questions, and speaks to some
              individuals. All of the dialog is in Spanish with the exception of conversation with
              Grenadians. About midway through the footage, there is a shift to Alexander Haig
              appearing on a program called "Freeman Reports." He is making comments following a
              1984 presidential debate between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale. He responds to one
              question before the end of the tape.</p>

              >Miami-Havana</emph> (1992) as well as interviews and footage featured in the
            documentary. This 52-minute film examines the personal impact of families divided as a
            result of diplomatic conflict between the United States and Cuba. The documentary
            features a series of interviews and airport scenes that address struggles families face
            in light of restrictions on travel and communications between the two countries. </p>
          <p>Filmed in both Havana and Miami, the documentary also examines the successive waves of
            Cuban emigration, America's blockade of Cuba, and the US imprisonment and deportation of
            the Cuban "excludables."</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview with Arturo Villar. He discusses his insights on
              what drove the balseros, people who traveled via makeshift rafts from Cuba to the
              United States, as well the Marielitos (refugees of the 1980 Mariel boatlift). He also
              discusses the creation of Radio Progeso in Miami. The second half the video contains
              an interview of Arturo and his wife, Jorgina, together. Jorgina talks about when they
              left Cuba to live in Spain, Puerto Rico, and Miami, and her subsequent visits to Cuba.
              At the end of the video, there are close-up shots of Arturo and conversations with his
              wife and the interviewers.</p>

            <p>In this video, Estela interviews two men on the street in Miami. They describe the
              work that they do to support Cuban exiles in the United States. Another woman joins
              the conversation and Estela asks them all to share their opinions on the relationship
              between the United States and Cuba. The woman reacts strongly to Estela's question and
              they continue to debate the two countries' relationship as well as things Cuba could
              do to improve quality of life for its citizens.</p>

            <p>This video contains an interview with Saimi and her family. Saimi had lived in Miami
              and is speaking about the cultural differences between living in the United States and
              Cuba. She compares the United States with Cuba, saying that in the U.S., one needs a
              lot of money and has to work very hard to survive but in Cuba one doesn't pay rent,
              utilities, or water bills. Her sister and mother express their happiness to have the
              family reunited in Cuba again. The interview concludes with close-up, background, and
              cutaway shots of Saimi and her family. The final five minutes feature a different
              interview of an unidentified family discussing the hardships of maintaining
              connections as a family divided between the United States and Cuba.</p>

            <p>This video begins with brief segments of Cuban political leaders, including Juan
              Almeida meeting with dignitaries in Namibia. Beginning at minute 4:00 the footage
              switches to an interview with three young Namibians. The interview was recorded on the
              first day of Namibian independence in 1990, and the students discuss their excitement
              for the new government and eagerness to participate in the political process. The
              three students, all of whom received part of their education in Cuba, talk about their
              experiences studying in Cuba and the ways they hope to use their educations. They also
              talk briefly about continued racism in Namibia between white and black communities,
              and feeling removed from their country after studying abroad for several years.</p>

            <p>This recording was originally labeled "Isla Juventud Escuela Namibia". It contains
              interviews and footage in and near a travel office in Havana. The video begins with an
              interview of a mother and daughter on the street discussing their attempts to obtain
              visas to emigrate to the United States legally to join their family. They describe
              their lack of resources and options, and how they are considering traveling illegally

              United States. The last two minutes contain an interview with a Namibian student in
              English. The student describes how she keeps in touch with her family in Namibia, and

            <p>This video features footage recorded live at the swearing-in ceremony of the first
              Namibian president Sam Nujoma in 1990. The footage largely features crowds and
              dignitaries arriving at Windhoek Stadium (later called Independence Stadium) in
              Windhoek, Namibia. The footage appears to be live coverage recorded by NBC News. The
              swearing in ceremony features speeches by United Nations Secretary General Javier
              Pèrez de Cuèllar and South African President Frederik Willem de Klerk. Nujoma is
              sworn-in as Namibia's first president by de Cuèllar and makes a brief speech at the
              end of the video.</p>

          <p>In 1960, rumors circulated Cuba that the new revolutionary government planned to
            suspend parental authority and enroll the children in military schools or send them to
            Russia for Communist indoctrination. In the wake of the rumors, Cuban parents sent as
            many as 14,000 unaccompanied children on flights out of Cuba between 1960 and 1962. The
            United States government facilitated this mass exodus of Cuban children, which became
            popularly known as Operation Peter Pan, through a clandestine program that waived the
            children's visa requirements and provided several million dollars to the Miami Catholic
            Welfare Bureau to care for the children. Many parents expected to be reunited with their
            children after what they believed would be the swift fall communist government.
            Following the Bay of Pigs invasions in 1962, however, US-Cuba relations deteriorated,
            and permanently separated many parents and children. Some children were able to connect
            with family members in the United States, but approximately 7000 were moved into
            long-term orphanages or foster care.</p>
          <p>Estela Bravo's documentary <emph render="italic">Operation Peter Pan: Flying Back to
              Cuba</emph> about the experience of these children was selected as Best Documentary
            Feature at the 2011 Havana Film Festival in New York. It also won First Prize at the
            Festival Internacional de Cine Politico, Buenos Aires; Best Documentary at the 7th Human
            Rights International Festival in Bolivia; and the Coral Award at the International
            Festival of New Latin American Cinema.</p>

          <p>This 57-minute documentary <emph render="italic">Operation Peter Pan</emph> (<emph
              render="italic">Operación Peter Pan</emph>) was released in 2011 and tells the story
            of the mass migration of Cuban minors to the United States. It uses footage from the
            National Archives and features interviews with individuals who traveled to the United
            States in Operation Peter Pan. The film primarily centers on a group of five who
            traveled back to Cuba for the first time after almost fifty years. Estela Bravo follows
            them as they explore their past and help bridge the emotional and political divides
            between the United States and Cuba. </p>

            <p>This video features and interview with Father Bryan O. Walsh. Walsh begins by
              discussing the children currently in the care of his Catholic organization in Miami.
              At the time of the interview Walsh explained that he was caring for 25 children
              between the ages of 14 and 18. He describes the motivation of many Cuban parents who
              decided to send their children to the United States in the early 1960s, explaining
              that many feared their children would be sent to Russia for communist indoctrination.
              He also discusses his organization's role in clandestine efforts to send Cuban
              children the US, and explains that parents expected Castro would be overthrown and
              their children would quickly return. He later discusses children who had a difficult
              time adjusting to life in the US, and the Miami-based youth organization the Antonio
              Maceo Brigade, which was outspoken in its support of the Cuban government.</p>

          <p>In the 1970s several thousand Chilean citizens fled their country to escape the
            dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Most of the exiles were either supporters of former
            president Salvador Allende or activists on the political left who feared abuse under the
            new government. Exiles were barred from returning for many years, but by 1984 the
            Chilean government agreed to grant most of the exiles permission to return home. This
            opening was spurred by international pressure and a domestic campaign to abolish
            restrictions on exiles. </p>
          <p><emph render="italic">Returning to Chile</emph>, which documents the return of Chilean
            political exiles, won a 1986 Silver Toucan Award at the Rio de Janiero International
            Film Festival.</p>

          <p>Estela Bravo's 1986 documentary <emph render="italic">Returning to Chile</emph> tells
            the story of Chileans exiles who returned to the country in the mid-1980s. This
            documentary explores the experience of youth who returned to Chile without their parents
            after living in exile for many years. Several of the youths featured in the documentary
            discuss their difficulty adjusting to life in Chile and struggles with identity. A
            portion of the film focuses on Carlos Godoy Echegoyen, a twenty-three-year-old Socialist
            who died under torture in a police station in the port of Quintero in February 1985,
            shortly after returning from exile. Bravo interviews his mother and his sister. It also
            features scenes in a cemetery at Godoy's grave and the graves of others, including
            Victor Jara, and Salvador Allende. The film also tells the story of three children from
            one family whose parents were taken and who must fend for themselves.</p>
          <p>Videos in this series include full-length copies of the documentary with subtitles in
            English as well as raw footage and interviews. Footage features cemetery scenes,
            discussions about Carlos Godoy, Chilean religious and social welfare groups, speeches by
            Pinochet, and other background scenes.</p>

            <p>This video features a speech by Augusto Pinochet delivered on September 11, the
              anniversary of the military coup in which he seized power in Chile. In his speech,
              Pinochet contends that Chile must continue to fight against communism and Marxism. He
              discusses the history of communism and argues that Chile must stay vigilant because
              the goal of communism is to take over the world. He contends that his government is
              protecting democracy, and argues that if critics understood the threat that Chile
              faced they would know that his actions were correct. The second half of this video
              features footage of a Cuban dramatic television program filmed by Estela Bravo.</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview with the mother of assassinated political
              activist Carlos Godoy. Godoy's mother begins by discussing the youth movement in Chile
              and the reasons Chilean youth have expressed such strong resistance to the Pinochet
              government. At the time of the interview, which was filmed sometime around 1985, she
              explains that the children have lived under Pinochet for 12 years and many remember
              their family members disappearing or going into exile, and cannot see a future for
              themselves under the current government. She expresses her hope in the community and
              her faith that the government will eventually change. The video then focuses on news
              reports and photos of Carols Godoy and his murder. At minute 17:55 the videos changes
              to an interview with the executive secretary of the foundation Protection of Youth
              Damaged by State of Emergency (PIDEE), which helped children whose parents had been
              harmed, detained, or disappeared by the government. She describes the foundation, its
              goals, and the kind of support it provides to the children whose families were
              targeted for political reasons.</p>

              living abroad for many years. The young women describe how life in Chile are different
              from their lives abroad in France and Canada. Recorded sometime around 1985, the young

              Salvador Allende. One discusses why her family moved to Canada, and her memories of
              Chile before they left. They also discuss the reasons they decided to return to Chile,
              and briefly discuss their involvement in youth activist movements.</p>

          <p>The documentary <emph render="italic">Silvio and Pablo in Argentina</emph> (1984) shows
            footage from a concert held in Argentina in 1984 following the country's transition from
            a military dictatorship to democracy. Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes, two of Cuba's
            most popular composer-singer-musicians, organized the concert, which featured some of
            the best Argentine folk musicians at that time. The documentary shows the enthusiastic
            response of the Argentine people, as the musicians perform songs that had previously
            been prohibited in Argentina. This series contains footage of Rodriguez and Milanes in
            Argentina, as well as some footage of the performers at a concert in the Bronx.</p>

            Estela Bravo sheds light on major events in the history of US-Cuba relations including

            immigration workers, and incomplete portions of the documentary, and an early version of

            <p>Lourdes Casal (1938-1981) was a Cuban poet, sociologist, and activist. She
              participated in anti-Batista activities in college, but later left Cuba following the
              revolution. She moved to New York City in 1962, where she attended the New School and
              received a PhD in Social Psychology. In 1969 she founded the Institute of Cuban
              Studies. She later returned to Cuba on a number of occasions. On a trip to Cuba in
              1979, her health deteriorated and she decided to stay, dying there in 1981.</p>

              conducted by Estela Bravo in Union City, New Jersey in which she asks the men why they
              traveled to the United States and what they hoped to find. The majority of the men
              interviewed were living in the United States for less than a year at the time the
              interviews were conducted. Many mention that they left Cuba because they did not agree
              with the communist government. Others explain that they left to find better work and
              earn money although several mention that they have had a difficult time finding work
              in the United States. They likewise describe finding it difficult to get adequate
              housing and access to medical care. One man notes that he has received little support
              from the existing Cuban community in the US, and has received more support from other
              immigrant groups including Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. Some of the men mention
              travelling to the US as part of the Mariel Boatlift. The term "escoria" refers to a
              statement made by Fidel Castro about Cuban exiles, comparing those who left to escoria
              (scum).</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview with a man who traveled from Miami to Cuba to
              visit family. In this segment he discusses his impression of the country, which he
              contrasts with his experience of traveling to Jamaica. The video then changes to
              on-the-street interviews with Cubans, many of whom express their interest in leaving
              the country for the United States or Canada. They discuss their reasons for wanting to
              leave, and what they hope to find outside of Cuba. Many express dissatisfaction with
              the government and a desire be reunited with family members who have already left
              Cuba.</p>

            <p>This videos features several short on-the-street interviews and segments of footage
              filmed in Havana around 1991. The video begins with a brief interview with a taxi
              driver about his work and life in Cuba. The segment is followed by a 10-minute
              interview with a Cuban military leader and a Spaniard living in Cuba named Ignacio "el
              Gallego" Gonzalez. They talk about three Spaniards, including Gonzalez, who fought for
              Castro during the Cuban Revolution. The end of the video features on-the-street
              interviews with individuals in Havana about increased tourism in Cuba, and their
              opinions about people from the Cuban exile community traveling back to the
              country.</p>

            <p>Carlos Muniz Varela (1953-1979), along with his sister, was sent from Cuba to the
              United States in 1961 as a part of Operation Peter Pan. He later became an outspoken
              activist in favor of normalization between the United States and Cuba. On April 28,
              1979, Muniz was ambushed while driving in San Juan, Puerto Rico and shot several
              times, most likely by individuals from a counterrevolutionary organization.</p>

            <p>The first eight minutes are old black and white footage telling the story of Carlos
              Muniz. There is no sound. This is followed by Estela Bravo interviewing a room of
              women in uniform. They are from the Cuban Immigration Department. The final few
              minutes appear to involve working men outside. There is a line of people waiting to
              obtain passports. All of the footage is in Spanish.</p>

          <p>The 1992 documentary <emph render="italic">The Three Rafters</emph> (<emph
              render="italic">Tres Balseros</emph>) tells the story of two brothers and their cousin
            who left Cuba illegally on a raft to Miami. They did not tell anyone about their
            journey, and after a few months of living in the United States, they asked Cuba's
            representatives in the United States for permission to return. They were finally able to
            return to Cuba, and upon their arrival, they share their experiences with relatives who
            knew nothing of their travels to the United States. Footage from this documentary
            includes scenes from the three rafters' arrival in Cuba and possibly a full-length copy
            of the film.</p>

          <p>The 2007 documentary <emph render="italic">Who Am I?</emph> provides a continuation of
            Estela Bravo's 1985 film, <emph render="italic">Missing Children</emph>, tracing the
            struggle of families of those disappeared during Argentina's "Dirty War" (1976-1983) to
            discover the fate of their loved ones and to recover the kidnapped children of those who
            were killed. This film centers on an organization of women known as the " Grandmothers
            of the Plaza de Mayo" who gained worldwide recognition for their weekly demonstrations
            in the center of Buenos Aires and their continued search for missing children. </p>
          <p>The film includes interviews with the found children and with people who knew their
            parents, as well as trial footage related to the prosecution of individuals responsible
            for carrying out state-sponsored violence against political dissidents. Records in this
            series include a completed copy of the documentary, raw footage, and a press and
            promotional materials related to the release of the film.</p>

          <p>By the time <emph render="italic">Who Am I? </emph>was released in 2007, the number of
            found children was 88. A new version, released in 2014, provides updates to the story,
            including the discovery of "Grandchild 114" Guido, the grandson of Estela Carlotto.
            Carlotto was one of the founders and president of the Grandmothers del Plaza de Mayo and
            had been searching for her grandson for almost forty years. Upon its release in 2007,

          <p>For four days, during Easter Week in 1987, the Argentine people demonstrated in the
            streets to prevent a military coup that threatened to overturn the elected government.
            The title of the documentary is taken from a popular chant of the protesters, which
            asked, "Who's running the show - the military or the people?"</p>

            follows a news reporting style with on-the-street interviews by Estela Bravo to capture
            the opinions of the protesters and people in the area. The film also shows footage of
            crowds during the protests, and reactions of elected officials.</p>

          <p>The series contains an assortment of recordings. Some of the videos contain footage
            that was shot independently, and not for a specific film. Examples of these recordings
            include clips from Brazil, from Mexico, and an interview concerning the Revolutionary
            Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This series also contains several clips relating to
            Nelson Mandela for which the specific film cannot be determined. Other footage that
            cannot be associated with a specific film due to lack of contextual information is also
            included in this series. An example is an interview Bravo conducted with three
            individuals in New York. The original box annotations suggest that these individuals are
            Dominicans but there is no indication of the specific film. The conversation with these
            individuals continues on more than one cassette. It is unclear whether this is
            independent material or may have been created for a specific film.</p>

              He delivers a short public speech about illegal immigration to the United States and
              US policy toward Cuba. The remaining footage focuses on individuals attempting to
              travel to Florida from Cuba on rafts. Some of the footage repeats, and several
              portions contain voice over narration. Footage also features a brief interview segment

            <p>This video features three interviews and a series of video clips recorded from
              television programs. The first interview features the widow of Cuban pacifist Luciano
              Nieves. She discusses her husband's assassination, and describes him as a pioneer for
              calling for improved relations between the US and Cuba in the 1970s. The second
              interview features anti-Castro political activist Felipe Rivero. Rivero discusses his
              involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion and addresses criticism about members of his
              movement who have been charged with or convicted of terrorism. He specifically
              discusses members of his organization who were convicted for the assassination of
              Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. The third interview features Miami priest Father
              Bryan Walsh. Walsh discusses his role in sponsoring Cuban children traveling to the US
              without their parents between 1960 and 1962, and the US government's role in
              supporting that work. The final 30 minutes to the tape feature assorted clips recorded
              from television. Video and audio quality is very poor and the bulk of the content on
              the second half of this tape is difficult to view.</p>

            <p>This video contains an interview on the beach in Guanabo, Cuba with Viteo, a man who
              had lived in the United States but who returned to Cuba. He explains that it was hard

              children. Upon seeing two Black children, Viteo states that they would be criminalized
              in the United States because they are Black. Viteo continues talking to the Black
              family, saying they would face racism and discrimination in the United States.</p>

              daughter explains that she was 11 years old at the time, and she and her siblings did
              not know how to care for themselves. They explains that they were able to survive with
              financial support from the government, and assistance from their neighbor who tried to
              help them as much as she could. At the time the interview was recorded in 1991, the
              family had not been able to locate their mother, and they did not know if she was
              still living.</p>

              man speaking in Spanish. He talks about attacks and assassinations carried out by
              far-right-wing, anti-Castro terrorist groups, mentioning a bombing of the Cuban
              Mission to the UN carried out by a New Jersey-based group Omega 7. He also speaks
              about the larger context of these groups and discusses the assassinations of Orlando
              Letelier, Carlos Muniz, and Eulalio Negrin. He describes the origin of these

              propaganda from the United States.</p>

            <p>This video features on-the-street interviews with people in Havana discussing
              families divided between the United States and Cuba. A small portion of the
              interviewees discuss their family members who are in the United States and the
              difficulty of reconnecting them. They discuss the difficulty of obtaining visas to see
              their family in the US, and the pain of family separation. The majority of the people
              featured in the video, however, state that they do not have family abroad and talk
              generally about their pride as Cubans and their desire to stay in their country.
              Others discuss their opposition to the US blockade and US policy toward Cuba.</p>

            <p>This video contains portions of two interviews. The first is part of an interview
              with two young people in Cuba, Heidi and Ricardo, talking about their perceptions of
              the United States, what they envision life would be like living there, and their
              desire to live there. The second segment features Ana Rosa, who is the director of
              Lornas de Bosque, a state-run home for abandoned children, many of whom were left
              behind when their parents went to the United States. A young woman, Mercedes, is also
              interviewed with her infant sleeping beside her. She and her siblings had lived at
              Lornas de Bosque as children when her parents left for the United States. Estela asks
              her how she felt being left behind and what she would say to her parents. The video
              also has close-ups and cutaways of the women and the baby.</p>

            <p>The video consists of footage for a press release from Robert and Michael Meeropol.
              They express their thanks for Cuba's commemorative events honoring the 35th
              anniversary of their parents' execution. In a prepared joint statement, they comment
              on their efforts to have the United States government release secret documents related
              to their parents' case, anti-communist sentiment in the United States, and the peace
              movement in the United States. The video ends with cutaway footage of Michael and

            <p>The first 12 minutes of this video contains footage from interviews at home with
              Robert and Michael Meeropol and their families. The Meeropol children answer and ask
              questions about their grandparents, their fathers' work to reopen Julius and Ethel's
              case, what they want to be when they grow up, and their trip to Cuba. The children
              talk about some posters of Fidel Castro, Che Guevera, and Cuba in the home. The
              children share drawings they made and thank people they met in Cuba during their
              visit. Michael and Robert also express gratitude to those they met during their visit,
              and they all sing Guantanamera together. There are several minutes of a recorded
              program from WNET, "Youth Unemployment: A Question of Survival." There are several
              minutes of a program in Spanish covering protests outside the 1st NY Cuban Film
              Festival and other events. The last four minutes of the video contains screeching
              audio and footage of a large group of women and girls rolling out dough together.</p>

              people and immigrants in New York City. The panelists discuss the lack of opportunity
              and jobs, and the drug epidemics in New York. Estela asks them to explain what new
              Cuban immigrants will encounter if they come there. The panelists discuss the fear and
              the lack of government support and protection for Black, Puerto Rican, and immigrants
              of color. They say that Black Cubans face double oppression in the United States.</p>

            <p>Luis Carlos Prestes (1898-1990) was a Brazilian revolutionary. He led rebels on a
              three-year trek (beginning in 1924) through the interior of Brazil in an attempt to
              spark a rebellion in the countryside. The attempt failed, but he became a romantic
              figure in Brazil and went on to lead the Brazilian Communist Party. He was imprisoned
              after a 1935 uprising, but released after World War II, and served for a short time as
              a senator.</p>

            <p>This video begins with an interview Estela Bravo recorded with the sons of Julius and
              Ethel Rosenberg, Michael and Robert Meeropol and their families. The footage was
              recorded in Springfield, MA on the 25th anniversary of the Rosenberg's death for a
              Cuban television program. Bravo asks the Meeropols about their travel to Cuba and
              their impressions of the country. Much of the video on this recording is in poor
              condition, and in many places only the audio is available. The children of Michael and
              Robert Meeropol discuss their visit to Cuba and describe their understanding of how
              their grandparents died. At the end of the segment the family sings the Cuban folk
              song "Guantanamera." Beginning at minute 12:00 the video changes to various clips from
              Cuban television programs. Many of these clips contain no audio. The second half of
              the video features a boxing match.</p>

            <p>This video features a television program on the execution of Julius and Ethel
              Rosenberg. It begins with a brief interview with their sons Robert and Michael
              Meeropol who talk about their parents and the loss they still feel many years after
              their deaths. The program, which initially aired in 1974, details the legal efforts to
              grant the Rosenbergs clemency or a stay of execution. The program then provides an
              update, recorded in 1978, which reviews government documents and questions the
              impartiality of judge Kaufman, who sentenced the Rosenbergs to death.</p>

          <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
          <p>This series contains a small collection of family films recorded by Estela Bravo
            between the 1950s and 1960s. Reels contain footage of events including parties,
            vacations, and visits with family. They feature the Bravos during the early years of
            their marriage and include footage of personal moments with their children and friends.
            The home movies were shot in a number of locations including New York, Miami, Paris, and
            São Paulo. A set of reels in this series were numbered 1-7; these numbers were created
            by Estela and Ernesto Bravo. Several reels were accompanied with limited contextual
            information and have yet to be identified. Family films that are in digital formats
            contain similar content as several of the reels, and many have been modified to contain
            sound. Several videos have been overlaid with music, while others contain audio of
            Estela Bravo explaining events captured in the films. Contents of these videos largely
            document the travels of the Bravos in the 1950s.</p>

          <p>This series contains one electronic file of the complete documentary <emph
              render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph>. The 2017 documentary recounts the experience of
            Gerardo Hernández and his wife Adriana Perez who attempted to conceive a child while
            Hernández was serving two consecutive life sentences in the United States for espionage.
            Hernández, along with four other Cuban agents, was arrested in Miami in 1998 for spying
            on the United States, they became known as the Cuban Five. The Cuban government claimed
            they were spying on anti-Cuban terrorists in Miami, but the five were ultimately
            convicted of espionage and acting as foreign agents. In 2014 as US-Cuban relations began
            to thaw the United States government helped Hernández and Perez conceive a child through
            artificial insemination. Hernández and two other Cuban agents were released that year in
            exchange for several American prisoners in Cuba. Hernández returned to Cuba two months
            before the birth of his daughter, Gema.</p>
