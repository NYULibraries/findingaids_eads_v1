    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Brooklyn's Plymouth Church was founded in the Congregationalist tradition in 1847 in the neighborhood of Brooklyn Heights.  Its first building was erected on Cranberry Street between Hicks and Henry Streets in that same year.  The Church's first pastor, the charismatic orator Henry Ward Beecher (1813-1887), quickly catapulted the church to a position of national prominence and regularly filled the pews to overflowing.  When the church's building was destroyed by fire in 1849, a new red brick building, known as the Sanctuary, was quickly constructed directly behind the church's original site, facing Orange Street, and opened for worship in 1850.  Designed by English architect J.C. Wells, the Sanctuary was built to seat 2,800 parishioners and was distinctive for its open design, cast iron columns, and balconies, providing the feel of an auditorium more than a traditional church.  The church's original building on Cranberry Street was rebuilt in 1862 to house offices, parlors, and Sunday school rooms.</p><p>During the mid-19th century, Plymouth Church was famous not only for Beecher's magnetic oratorical style and widely published sermons, but also for its role as a vehicle for the anti-slavery movement.  Beecher held mock enslaved people auctions at the Church through which parishioners could actually purchase the freedom of enslaved persons, and invited some of the most distinguished abolitionists of the period, including Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and Sojourner Truth, to speak at the Church.  Documentary evidence suggests that the Church was also a major site of activity for the Underground Railroad, the abolitionist network that secretly transported enslaved people to freedom in the North and Canada.  In the early 1870s, Plymouth Church's prestige was briefly shattered when Beecher was accused of adultery, a charge that led to what would become the most widely publicized court trial in 19th-century America.  Beecher was eventually acquitted in 1875, and despite the damage done to his reputation, he was able to overcome the scandal and continued to lead Plymouth Church until his death in 1887.  He was succeeded by former lawyer Lyman Abbott, who resigned as pastor in 1899.</p><p>Plymouth Church continued to merit distinction throughout the 20th century as well.  In 1934, it united with the neighboring Church of the Pilgrims (the former congregation of famed pastor Richard Salter Storrs) and was known afterwards as the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims.  During the 1950s, when Congregational churches across America were compelled to join either one of two national denominations, the liberal United Church of Christ or the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims decided to remain independent.  It then aligned itself with the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches, an organization comprised of autonomous Congregational churches.  In 1961, the National Register of Historic Places deemed Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims a National Historic Landmark in recognition of its significant place in American history.  As of 2010, Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims continues to serve the Brooklyn community, and its campus has grown to include five buildings: Hillis Hall (occupying the site of the Church's original edifice), the Sanctuary, a Church House, a Gymnasium, and an Arcade.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Plymouth Church publications and ephemera span the period 1850 to 1963 and document Plymouth Church's administration and activities before and after its unification with the Church of the Pilgrims.  Items include annual reports, manuals, membership lists, pamphlets, periodicals, and additional ephemeral literature.</p><p>Annual reports and manuals feature extensive summary information on the Church, such as historical sketches, doctrines, guidelines for admission, listings of church officers, and additional administrative information.  Membership lists include dates of members' admittance and death/dismissal.</p><p>Pamphlets date from 1873 and 1874 and contain statements written by and distributed among representatives of Plymouth Church, the Clinton Avenue Congregational Church, and the Church of the Pilgrims.  The statements concern Plymouth Church's controversial refusal of a possible unification of the three churches as a council, a prospect very likely spurred by the surfacing of the Henry Ward Beecher adultery scandal.  An additional pamphlet contains the constitution of the Plymouth League, a social prayer group comprised of members of Plymouth Church.</p><p>Periodicals are comprised of issues of several Plymouth Church publications, including <emph render="italic">The Pilgrim</emph>, dating from 1894 to 1901; <emph render="italic">Plymouth Chimes</emph>, dating from 1896 to 1900; and <emph render="italic">Plymouth News</emph>, dating from 1943 to 1953.  Also included are three copies of the March 1879 issue of <emph render="italic">Plymouth Triangle</emph>, which are housed separately from the rest of the collection in an oversize box.</p><p>Additional ephemeral items include programs, brochures, circulars, and clippings relating to worship and memorial services, ceremonies, festivals, concerts, theatrical performances, and additional events throughout the period 1850 to 1963.  A small amount of programs pertaining to the Church of the Pilgrims during the years 1933 and 1934, shortly before its unification with Plymouth Church, are also included.</p><p>Finally, the collection includes a small number of items focusing on Plymouth Church pastor Lyman Abbott.  These include an 1890 pamphlet containing the minutes of the council overseeing the installation of Abbott as pastor, and one issue of the religious weekly periodical, <emph render="italic">The Outlook</emph>, circa 1900, containing an article by Abbott in which he reflects upon his years at Plymouth Church.</p>  </scopecontent>
