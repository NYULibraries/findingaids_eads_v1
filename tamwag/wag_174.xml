            <p>The Profession and Administrative Staff Association (PASTA) at the Museum Modern Art (MOMA) began in response to discrepencies in salaries and concerns regarding job security held by individuals working at MOMA. In 1971 PASTA held elections and officially affiliated with the Distributive Workers of America, as Musuem Local No. 1. This was the first union of museum professionals in the United States. PASTA established an affiliation with United Auto Workers (UAW), District 65 in 1980 and is now affiliated with UAW Local 2110. PASTA conducted a strike in 2000 during contract negotiations before MOMA's 2001-2004 expansion project.</p>
