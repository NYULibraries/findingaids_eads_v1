Following the war, Martin worked on the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea, becoming spokesperson and advocate for the indigenous Aleut sealing community. She produced a series of articles and books on Aleut culture and history and edited an Aleut language dictionary. In 1950, Martin moved to Cuernavaca, Mexico, a cultural outpost for Spanish exiles and American expatriates.

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Fredericka (Freddie) Imogene Martin - Spanish Civil War nurse, writer, and historian -- was born in Cooperstown, New York on June 2, 1905. Her father died in an accident before her birth and when she was five her mother remarried. They moved to Oneonta, New York where Martin -- a spirited child by her own account -- grew up in a warm and indulgent family. Following high school, she lived and worked with the St. Margaret Episcopalian Order of Nuns in Jersey City, New Jersey, and in 1925 attended the affiliated nursing school of Christ Hospital. She graduated with honors and as a young woman practiced professionally in hospitals throughout New York City. As supervisor and head nurse she served on the staffs of Bellevue, Fordham, Lying-In Hospital, and Crotona Park Hospital. In 1929, Martin married English-born Alexander Cohen. During the early 1930s Martin became an active member in the nurses union, attended political sciences classes at the Labor Temple in New York City, and began developing her aptitude for foreign languages, learning Russian and Yiddish. In 1935, while visiting her in-laws in England she traveled to Germany and Russia. Her time abroad awakened her to the growing threat of Fascism. When she returned, a nurses' union colleague encouraged Martin to become active in the then nascent Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy. Initially organized by a group of doctors and concerned citizens to provide medical supplies, food and clothing to the beleaguered Spanish Republic, by late 1936 the Medical Bureau was recruiting personnel to send to Spain as well.</p>
            <p>On January 16, 1937 Martin embarked on the 
                <title render="italic">S.S. Paris</title>as part of the first American medical unit to Spain. Under the leadership of surgeon Dr. Edward Barsky, Martin served as chief nurse and administrator of the American Hospital division. The first unit traveled with four ambulances, 12 tons of medical supplies and all the necessary equipment to outfit a 50-bed hospital. During her period of service, Martin supervised the work of fifty-four nurses, aided in the organization of six American hospitals on four fronts, and helped set up a mobile operating unit. She also organized literacy classes and trained Spanish women to assume some of the nursing and hospital administration duties. Her commanding bearing (at nearly 5'9" she was a full head taller than most of her staff), authoritative mien, and maternal attention to both the patients in the ward and the nurses under her management, earned her the affectionate appellation of "Ma."</p>
            <p>In February 1938 Martin returned to the United States to conduct a yearlong national speaking tour, recruiting personnel and raising funds to keep the medical volunteers in Spain supplied. During the West Coast stretch of her tour Martin shared the stage with a representative of the Catalan government, and writer Dorothy Parker. Following her tour, Martin enrolled in the Public Administration program at New York University. Her studies were cut short when, in April 1939, she was invited to establish and serve as superintendent of a hospital in Greenbelt, Maryland -- a federally funded housing initiative created under the Resettlement Administration.</p>
            <p>Martin's union with Cohen ended in an amicable divorce in the late 1930s and she married her second husband, Dr. Samuel Berenberg in 1940. In 1941 Berenberg took a medical assignment on the Pribilof Islands 300 miles off the coast of Alaska in the Bering Sea. With Martin's assistance, Berenberg managed the Fish and Wildlife Hospital on St. Paul Island. Martin's work brought her into contact with the indigenous Aleut sealing community, non-citizen wards of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Stirred by their struggle for self-determination and freedom from decades of discrimination and exploitation (first under the Russians and later the American government), Martin spent the next ten years of her life advocating on behalf of the community. She came to be regarded as an expert on the Aleut, producing a series of articles and books including 
                <title render="italic">The Hunting of the Silver Fleece</title>, and 
                <title render="italic">Sea Bears: the Story of the Fur Seal</title>, editing an Aleut language dictionary, and translating numerous manuscripts and articles.</p>
            <p>With the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Martin and Berenberg returned to Greenbelt with their newborn daughter Tobyanne (named for Toby Jensky and Anne Taft, two nursing colleagues who had served with Martin in Spain). They settled in New York City where Berenberg became the chief of the Department of Health's Child Health Services and Martin embarked on her career as a writer. Following the dissolution of their marriage, Martin moved with the 9-year-old Tobyanne in 1950 to Cuernavaca, Mexico. A cultural outpost for Spanish exiles and American expatriates, Cuernavaca proved to be a congenial home for Martin. For the next 40 years she supported herself as translator, a travel book writer, and an instructor at a Spanish language institute, working with her former Medical Bureau colleague and fellow expatiate Lini (Fuhr) de Vries.</p>
            <p/>
            <p/>
            <p>When Spanish Civil War combat veteran Arthur Landis published 
                <title render="italic">The Abraham Lincoln Brigade</title>in 1967, Martin protested the lack of coverage given to the medical units and resolved to write a separate history on the Medical Bureau volunteers. In a letter to the Rabinowitz Foundation (08/20/1968) requesting funding for this project, Martin wrote: To tell the story of [American Medical Bureau] Field Units, their history must begin with the account of the organization and activities of the Medical Bureau in the US, the story of the Field Units at work in Spain, and their relationships and work with different nationalities and Spanish military and civilian organizations, and finally a summary of the contributions of AMB saving the lives of civilians and combatants.This ambitious task would occupy her for the remainder of her life. Working chiefly from her home in Cuernavaca, Martin set out to amass the most comprehensive record on the role of the medical units in Spain. She enlisted the aid of former veterans, friends, librarians and archivists to obtain books and articles, locate missing volunteers, conduct research, and contribute primary materials and financial aid. She corresponded with hundreds of medical and combat veterans from around the world, sending questionnaires and accruing personal data. In the early 1970s she traveled through Europe, Israel and the United States meeting with former Medical Bureau colleagues, conducting interviews, visiting research repositories, and collecting memorabilia and materials for her history. She traveled to Spain in 1972 to conduct research and revisited Villa Paz, the lavish estate that during the war had served as a front-line hospital.</p>
            <p>Although Martin produced abundant notes and drafted several chapters, struggles with money, poor clerical assistance, and failing health hampered her in her efforts to complete her Medical Bureau history. By 1982 her attention turned from her writing project to finding a suitable repository to administer the materials she had so assiduously collected and maintained in her cramped Cuernavaca cottage. In 1986, in recognition for her contributions to the Aleut, Martin was made honorary lifetime citizen of St. Paul Island, and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Alaska. On October 4, 1992 Martin died in Cuernavaca. She was 87 years old.</p>

                        <emph render="italic">Series I. Medical Personnel: Biographical Files and Correspondence 1936-1988.</emph>This series includes correspondence from and biographical material on hundreds of medical volunteers from over 25 countries (Includes materials written in Spanish, French, Russian, Rumanian and German). Particularly informative are questionnaires sent by Martin and filled in by dozens of doctors, nurses, ambulance drives and other medical personnel detailing their activities in Spain and their subsequent experiences. These also provide data on political affiliations before and after the war and personal motivations for going to Spain. Much of the correspondence to and from Martin chronicles the later lives of the volunteers and offers insights to the range of attitudes regarding Martin's efforts to record their work in Spain. Additionally, this series contains materials donated to Martin, including Spanish Civil War letters (originals and copies), diaries and journals (typescripts and photocopies) personal essays, clippings, leaflets, and other ephemera. Martin also collected medical writings and other materials published by the medical volunteers.</p>
                    <p>Notable in this series are: English volunteer Monica Milward Barnett's diary (transcription), which provides information on the Spanish Medical Aid Committee office in Barcelona; John Patrick O'Reilly's handwritten ward instructions from Villa Paz; a typescript in English of Mary Bingham de Urquidi's "Mercy in Madrid: a Personal History of the Spanish Civil War" (published in Spanish in 1975 under the title 
                        <title render="italic">Misericordia en Madrid</title>, an English-language version has never appeared in print); recollections of Dutch nurse Johana Maas; letters written by Ave Bruzzichesi to Dr. Leo Eloesser describing the withdrawal of foreign units from Spain, as well as files on Dr. Eloesser which include dispatches to the Medical Bureau from Spain; Spanish Civil War documents and Medical Bureau ephemera from Jose Dhaga, a native of Peru who volunteered with the North American medical unit; correspondence and material related to Alba Novac and her husband William Ryan, a combat volunteer who appeared before HUAC as a cooperative witness; files on Frances Vanzant, the only woman doctor attached to the American unit; information on George Zlatovski, charged in 1957 with spying for the Soviet Union; and Helen Freeman's 1949 letters, written from Germany while working for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.</p>
                    <p>Letters to and from Martin's close friends Anne Taft Muldavin and Toby Jensky offer insights on Martin's life and work over a forty-year period. This series also contains a biographical file on Martin, notes she took on her return to Spain in 1972, and a hospital ward journal she kept in Spain during the war. Research progress reports and rough drafts of Martin's manuscript "Proud within Themselves" (her unfinished history of the medical units) can be found here.</p>

                        <emph render="italic">Series II. Medical Subject Files, 1937-1984.</emph>This series contains Martin's research files pertaining to medical aid and services in Spain during the war. Materials related to the Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy are located in this series including research correspondence related to the establishment and structure of the Medical Bureau; brochures, press releases, leaflets, and other ephemera; information on the merger with the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy; and documents related to the passport application policy for Medical Bureau personnel. A file of correspondence, notes and written statements offers evidence of Martin's dogged efforts to amass and safeguard materials documenting the history of the Medical Bureau. The bulk of this series is devoted to files on the dozens of medical sites that were established by the International Brigade medical units during the war. Included are accounts excerpted by Martin from letters written by medical and combat volunteers detailing conditions and staffing, notes, clippings, and printed material related to each location.</p>
                    <p>There are several research files on the International Brigades medical services, as well as information on ambulance donations and ambulance drivers. Photocopies of articles from 
                        <title render="italic">Ayuda Medica Internacional</title>, the organ of the IB medical services, and files on treatment including the utilization of Hiram Orr's closed cast system can also be found here. Noteworthy is a hand-drawn diagram of a medical facility, circa 1937, headed "Sanitary Service of a Battalion in the Spanish Republican Army."</p>

                        <emph render="italic">Series III. Combat Volunteers: Biographical Files and Correspondence, 1937-1985.</emph>This series includes correspondence from and biographical material on Spanish Civil War combat volunteers. Although Martin corresponded with volunteers from many countries, the majority of these files document United States volunteers. Like the medical personnel files, these files include accounts of activities in Spain and chronicle the lives of the veterans in their later years. The correspondence and other material here also document the fraternal nature of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB), which provided financial, medical and legal assistance to its members. An example of this can be found in Robert Raven's file, which includes leaflets and a 1937 fundraising appeal on Robert Raven Rehabilitation Committee letterhead requesting aid for Raven who was blinded in Spain. Also notable is VALB correspondence related to the deportation of Carlos Soule Echeveria, a Spanish national who fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. (Additional material on veterans and VALB can be found in Series V: General Subject Files).</p>
                    <p>Among the veterans Martin corresponded with regularly were Edward Lending, David Miller, Steve Nelson, Mark Rauschwald, Irving Weissman and Randall (Pete) Smith, who headed up the veteran's Spanish Civil War Historical Committee. Other correspondents include VALB executive secretary Moe Fishman, Canadian volunteer William Beeching, and author Arthur Landis, with whom Martin had a heated exchange over the publication of his book. Recurring topics include Martin's concerns over finding a suitable repository for the Medical Bureau materials, consideration of whether the veterans should assume stewardship of their papers, and the establishment of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives at Brandeis.</p>

                        <emph render="italic">Series IV. General Correspondence, 1937-1985.</emph>This series consists of Martin's incoming and outgoing correspondence from a range of friends, political figures, researchers and former Medical Bureau officers and organizers. Included in this latter category are Executive Secretary Herman F. Reissig, Evelyn Ahrend Kirkpatrick, James Loeb, Louis Miller, Harold L. Oram, Violet Robbin, John Sherman, and Charles Tobach who contribute information on the structure and activities of the Medical Bureau in the United States. Other correspondents include: Canadian Communist leader Tim Buck and his wife Bess, journalist Herbert Matthews, writer Joesph North and his wife Helen, and Gina Medem, author of a book on Jewish participation in the Spanish Civil War. Also included is correspondence from historians Gabriel Jackson, Peter Wyden, Robert Rosenstone and Herbert Southworth. Of special note is a 1945 letter Martin sent to Congressional Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Sol Bloom protesting U.S. relations with Franco. Also included in this series are several of Martin's address books (with loose notes and lists of addresses) and a number of business cards of contacts and friends in many countries.</p>

                        <emph render="italic">Series V. General Subject Files, 1937-1987.</emph>This series consists of primary and secondary materials collected by Martin in the course of her research. Notable are correspondence, leaflets and brochures related to Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee; correspondence to Martin from German volunteers held at Gurs Concentration Camp; correspondence and articles related to Jewish participation in the Spanish Civil War; clippings and notes related to aid to refugees and exiles; primary materials from the American Relief Ship for Spain and the American Rescue Ship Mission, including a donation booklet; and bibliographic sources on the Spanish Civil War.</p>
                    <p>General materials on veterans and VALB are located in this series. The VALB files span the late 1940s through the 1980s. Particularly noteworthy are questionnaires sent by Martin and filled out by 36 veterans who were treated for wounds in Spain; memos, reports and clippings related to VALB and the Subversive Activities Control Board; programs and materials from VALB's 40th anniversary event honoring women; and notes and statements clarifying the relationship between VALB and Medical Bureau personnel.</p>
                    <p>Much of this series is given over to the copious research notes Martin took at various repositories, chiefly at the New York Public Library and Columbia University. Martin obtained thousands of pages of photocopies from Columbia University's Spanish Refugee and Relief Organization (SRRO) collection in her efforts to document the administrative history of the Medical Bureau. [Note: These photocopies have been retained, however permission to publish these photocopied materials must be obtained in writing from Columbia University's Librarian for Rare Books and Manuscripts].</p>
                    <p>The correspondence between Martin and Brandeis University archivist Victor Berch, who provided extensive research assistance to Martin, is a useful source of information on the course of her work, and on the establishment of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives at Brandeis. This series also includes many files of articles Martin clipped from the Cuernavaca papers (chiefly in Spanish with some English), mostly on politics and culture in Spain during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
