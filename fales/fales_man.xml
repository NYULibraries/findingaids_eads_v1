            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">The Fales Manuscript collection is made up of some 50,000 items, much of which was assembled by DeCoursey Fales from 1908-1966 and donated to NYU. The provenance of the materials is complicated, however. Following Fales' death in 1966, other collections and purchases were added into the Fales Manuscripts collection. We do not have a comprehensive listing of what Fales owned and what the library later purchased after his death. The collection consists of correspondence, manuscripts, drawings, photographs, realia, ephemera, and other materials primarily about English and American authors from 1700 to the present. There are special strenths in the Victorian, Edwardian, English 1890s, and Transition Period writers.</abstract>

            <p>The Fales Manuscripts Collection was begun by DeCoursey Fales sometime after he began collecting books in 1908-09. By 1957 when Fales donated the collection to NYU, it had grown to over 15,000 items. He continued to build the collection until his death in 1966, by which time it is believed that the collection housed some 50,000 items. Unfortunately, subsequent curators did not treat the Fales Manuscript Collection as a separate collection with a distinct provenance. Instead, they added new acquisitions into the collection, sometimes incorporating whole small archives, such as the Provincetown Players Archive, the Tom Clark Papers, the Frank Harris Papers, the Smith and Austen-Leigh Papers, and many others. The collection was processed in varying ways over the years. At some early point manuscripts style processing at the item level was done for letters A-C—the collection is organized alphabetically by author. This processing was very incomplete, though cards still exist for the initial portions of the collection. At some later date, the collection was foldered with several authors in each folder, making it difficult to use the papers and to maintain control over the holdings. The current processing was undertaken to refolder the collection, account for all materials currently held, and create a finding aid that would adequately reflect the collection as it stands today. In addition, we have preserved the original box numbering so that past citations to the box numbers are still identifiable. As much as possible where distinct collections have been identified within the Fales Manuscripts Collection, separate finding aids have been created for those portions of the collection. These collections are still filed within the Fales Manuscripts Collection, retaining their box and folder numbers as originally assigned.</p>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>De Coursey Fales (1888-1966) was a lawyer, banker, collector, bibliophile and yachtsman. In the last years of his life, Fales devoted himself full-time to collecting. Fales' collecting started with Walter Scott materials, and around that core, his collection grew to around 50,000 items pertaining to various authors spanning the 18th and 20th centuries. He began donating parts of that collection to New York University in 1957, and portions of his collection were also donated to the New York Public Library, Manhattan College, and the Morgan Library (of which he was a life fellow).</p>
