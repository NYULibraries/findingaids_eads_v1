            <p>Photographer Mathew Brady is represented, as well as his former employees Alexander Gardner, James Gibson, and Timothy O'Sullivan, who set up their own firm in 1863 because they wanted credit for their work which had previously all appeared under Brady's name. Other photographers include George N. Barnard, who photographed in Virginia and the Carolinas, Sam A. Cooley, who was the "Official Photographer" for the 10th Army Corps, and local photographers from Richmond, Gettysburg and other locations.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
            <p>The Civil War stereographs cover the entire period of the Civil War, from the first Battle of Bull Run through the surrender at Appomattox, and the triumphant parade of Union forces in Washington D.C. Most of the images were made in the Eastern Theatre, with scenes in Virginia by far in the majority. Views in northern states include naval shipyards in Massachusetts and Philadelphia, the battlefield at Gettysburg, and a rally and parades in New York City. Compelling images of death on the battlefield, and the destruction of cities, railroads and bridges show the devastating effects of the war. Individual and group portraits of participants are included along with images of soldiers relaxing in camps, drilling in the field, and ready for attack in trenches and other fortifications. There are images of African Americans fleeing slavery by crossing the Union lines, and of African Americans on southern plantations as well as serving in the Army and Navy. The damage to the Monitor after her fight with the Merrimac is shown, along with ships on the James River. Civilians also appear in the photographs, including photographers, artists and journalists, as well as a battlefield thief and members of the Sanitary Commission.</p>
            <p>Most of the views presented here were published during the war by the photographers who made them, or by publishers such as E. &amp; H.T. Anthony. Anthony's file was later obtained by General Ordway and published under successive imprints by John C. Taylor, and Taylor &amp; Huntington to take advantage of the 25th anniversary of the war, and reunions that were held at the time.</p>

            <p>The Society acquired these items from various sources, although primarily from George T. Bagoe (1886?-1948) who specialized in collecting Civil War stereographs among other subjects. His collection came to N-YHS in 1960 and 1961. Other significant groups of views were acquired in 1922, 1923 and 1936.</p>
