            <head>Processing Information Note</head>
            <p>Various portions of records from the Library Department were physically processed during the early 1990s to the early 2000s, mostly in terms of compiling related material together in boxes and refoldering some documents to archival folders. In the fall of 2016, project archivist Larry Weimer established an overarching arrangement for all the Library Department records in the archive, added new material, and completed a baseline inventory and finding aid for the entire record group. Certain steps were taken with the material in 2016, including the refinement of the physical arrangement of folders and re-boxing, in order to facilitate its use by researchers, but an overall minimal level of physical processing was implemented. Consequently, most of the material remains in its original folders and unarranged within folders.</p>

            <p>This finding aid relates to just one record group of the New-York Historical Society archives. For information about the other record groups and for overall information about the archives, please see the 
                <extref ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrgarchives/">Guide to the New-York Historical Society Archives</extref> (NYHSRG Archives). Other record groups that are processed and available to researchers and are especially related to the New-York Historical Society Library Department records (NYHS-RG 21) are as follows:</p>
            <p>The N-YHS governance level minute books and so-called official papers include much material concerning N-YHS's library matters, especially with regard to acquisitions. For years through 1938, see: 
                <extref ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrg1/">New-York Historical Society management committee records</extref> (NYHS-RG 1). For years subsequent to 1938, see New-York Historical Society Board of Trustees records (NYHS-RG 18).</p>
            <p>Library accessions were documented in ledgers from 1841-1962, with gaps. See 
                <extref ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrg15/">New-York Historical Society collection accession registers</extref> (NYHS-RG 15).</p>
            <p>N-YHS’s central correspondence files include documents relating to all aspects of NYHS operations, including the library, from the institution’s earliest days to 1982. The correspondence includes acquisitions, early reference inquiries, and other matters. See 
                <extref ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrg2/">New-York Historical Society general correspondence</extref> (NYHS-RG 2). Some acquisition correspondence, especially related to bequests, but also gifts and some purchases, was placed with legal records; see New-York Historical Society legal matters (NYHS-RG 16).</p>
            <p>The longtime assistant to Librarian Alexander Wall, Dorothy Barck was Librarian from 1942-1954. Her records are found in New-York Historical Society Librarian Dorothy C. Barck records (NYHS-RG 19).</p>
            <p>There are many connections between N-YHS’s library and museum, including collaborations on exhibitions, the transfer of the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture to the museum (1989) and back (1998), coordination of outgoing loans, and other matters. See New-York Historical Society Museum Department records (NYHS-RG 20).</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
            <p>The New-York Historical Society Library Department records group includes a broad range of material related to the administration of the Library and its component sections, including the Reading Room, Manuscripts Department, Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC, often referred to as the Print Room), and the Conservation Lab. The subject matter spans the entire breadth of the Library’s activities: acquisition of materials for the collection, curatorial and conservation surveys and assessments, collection inventorying and cataloging projects, in-house exhibitions and outgoing loans, and patron access and use of the collections.</p>
            <p>The record group includes correspondence and memos, surveys, management reports, statistical information, policies, planning documents, budgets, appraisals, acquisitions (purchase, donation) and sales, contracts, visitor registers, grant applications and project implementation files, exhibition files (e.g., checklists, loan agreements, label texts), cataloging worksheets, and conservation reports. Most of these records date from the last three decades of the twentieth century and into the early twenty-first century (see the Related Materials Note for most earlier documents). An exception to this are the visitor registers; though there are sizable gaps in the nineteenth century, these records date from as early as 1838. The record group also holds nineteenth century admission tickets and calling cards used to introduce and permit non-members to use library resources.</p>
            <p>The record group holds an array of collection descriptions and inventories compiled for various purposes over time, and these range from throughout N-YHS’s history. For example, there is a circa 1826 inventory of maps, John Delafield’s 1833 manuscript-form catalogue of the books in the library, the 1941 inventories of material sent off-site for storage during World War II, and a card catalog of comic books deaccessioned in the 1970s. Most of these inventories were prepared by N-YHS staff, but some in the record group were prepared by the collection donor or other outside party, such as the inventory of the Lathrop Colgate Harper Spanish-American War Collection distributed by Harper's estate.</p>

                    <p>The Collection Descriptions &amp; Inventories series includes primarily manuscript form inventories, catalogues and other material describing the content of N-YHS’s library collections. The bulk of these were prepared by N-YHS library staff from the nineteenth to early twenty-first century. Some inventories in the series were prepared by the original creator, donor, auction house, or other person outside of N-YHS. The series includes both standalone documents, such as John Delafield’s 1833 catalogue of books in the library, and working files for projects requiring the inventorying or cataloging of the collections. The container lists include reference to the specific descriptive material in the files.</p>

Inventories can be found in other record groups of the archive as well, perhaps especially the New-York Historical Society legal matters (NYHS-RG 16). Also some manuscript collections include the inventory supplied by the creator or donor.</p>

                        <p>The subseries includes primarily manuscript form inventories, catalogues and other material describing the content of N-YHS’s library collections. The subseries includes many standalone documents from the nineteenth century, such as John Delafield’s 1833 catalogue of books in the library and lists of manuscripts and maps from the 1820s.</p>
                        <p>Material from the twentieth century ranges beyond inventories to include broader descriptions of the library collections, working files of cataloging and other projects involving collection descriptions, bibliographies and guides to the collection. These files include, among others, records of the collections sent outside of New York City for safekeeping during World War II, the index to a comic book collection deaccessioned in the 1970s, annotated typescripts of Arthur J. Breton’s 
                            <emph render="italic">Guide to the Manuscript Collections of N-YHS</emph>, and the survey/inventory sheets from the NEH-funded project to catalog N-YHS’s maps (1989-1994 ). In addition to the map project, several other cataloging or other collection classification and control projects from the 1980s-1990s are documented in the subseries.

                        <p>The subseries is arranged in rough chronological order. Much of the nineteenth and early twentieth century material is undated; an approximate date is supplied based on the latest date of the items in the inventory or other indicators. Some map-related documents from the mid-1800s and later appear to have been used as source material for a 1990s NEH-funded cataloging project and were filed as found with that material.</p>
                        <p>The NEH-funded map cataloging project of August 1992-December 1994 is shown in the container list in two segments, designated I and II. Segment I includes records from the pilot project and the records through early 1993 when the project was shut down when N-YHS closed its doors at the time. Segment II includes the reactivated project records from 1994, as well as some earlier records that were carried forward.</p>

                            <p>These folders include various lists, descriptions, notes, clippings, a few letters, cards, labels, and other documents. These were found together by the archivist and kept as found. The documents as a whole appear to be a mix of materials used perhaps to summarize some accessions, identify gaps in holdings, form shelf location guides, develop catalog records, and other purposes. There seems no overall coherence to the whole or to the overall content of each folder, but some individual documents might be useful in their accession or other references.</p>

                            <p>This first box holds the A-Z index of comic books owned, by volume and number. The entry for each book includes a list of the features for that issue. This box and the next also hold an A-Z index by feature title, linking it to the relevant book title/issue. The entries are on oversize slips of paper held by metal prongs. Because of the way the slips are secured some may be difficult to read fully; should those cards need to be read, the preservation lab should be consulted for document access. It is possible that these cards were compiled, not by N-YHS, but by the creator/donor of the collection.</p>

Four manuscript form inventories are currently in the subseries, primarily concerning the collection of Randall J. Le Boeuf, Jr. The subseries also holds at least some auction catalogues that included sales of N-YHS duplicate and other holdings from the 1940s-1960s. The container list includes reference to the specific inventories held.</p>

                    <p>The series includes correspondence concerning acknowledgements of donations accepted, offers of items for purchase or donation, and declined offers. These relate principally to the period 1976 to 2001, though there are some records for 1964-1975. Appraisals and related inventories for many of these donations are included through about 1986. Slips of paper with summary information by donor for the 1960s-1993 are in the series, as are a small number of acquisition related logs and system print-outs. The series also includes some records of library purchases, including purchases from 1979-1982 from Baker &amp; Taylor, Gale Research, Heckman Bindery, university presses, subscription services, microfilm vendors, bookshops, publishers, and others.</p>
                    <p>This series includes those acquisition records found as standalone files during processing of the archive in 2016. References to acquisitions can also be found in the administrative files described in other series of this record group.</p>

                    <p>The acquisition files are arranged in chronological order. Some files that include documents from a wide date range, such as files of pending donations and of multiple donations by individual over time, are placed at the latest date found in the file. At the end of the principal acquisition files are found boxes of donor slips, which include summary donation information, and copies of bills for library purchases.</p>

                    <p>The series is arranged with what appears to be five relatively well-defined original sets of correspondence and subject files first, followed by various miscellaneous administrative and topical files. The five well-defined sets are identified in the container list by the prefixes</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                    <p>The General Office Files appear to have been maintained over time by the administrative assistants to the Library Director, including Mary Nathanson, Xenia Zielyk, Grace Hernandez, Patricia Contino, Sarah Grossman and others, though other files were likely mixed into these over time. Accordingly, the files hold a combination of management-level material (e.g., budgets and expense information, grants and grant proposals, annual or other management progress reports, activity statistics, staff memos, correspondence, general exhibition planning, fellowship proposals, donations, and acquisitions) as well as routine transactional documents (e.g., invoices for Baker &amp; Taylor, Readmore, Blackwell, RLG/RLIN and other library purchases and subscriptions).</p>
                    <p>There is considerable overlap in the subject matter of this series and the next, Series III. Librarian and Curatorial Files. There likely is no sharp distinction between them, but generally the content of the files in Series III seems more attributable to particular leaders in the library, while these general files seem to have a more varied provenance, including miscellaneous files added to the series by archivists over time.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                    <p>The series includes files that can be attributed, at least in large part, to particular individuals who headed the Library and/or played manuscript curatorial roles. These include Librarians (i.e., head of the Library) James Gregory (1966-1980), Larry Sullivan (1980-1984), Paul Cohen (1984-1987), James Mooney (1987-1989), Jean Ashton (1990-1993), Margaret Heilbrun (1993-2003), and, returning to N-YHS from Columbia University, Jean Ashton (2006-2012). Also included are files from manuscript curators Arthur Breton (1960s), Thomas Dunnings (1970s-1980s and institutional archivist, 1990-1993), Margaret Heilbrun (1987-1993), and Donna Davey (circa 2001-2004).</p>
                    <p>The series includes a broad range of subject matter, including budgets, management reports, statistics, library policies, exhibition planning, grants and projects (e.g., microfilming, cataloging, institutional archive, digitization), acquisitions and sales through Swann Galleries and other dealers, donations, collection surveys and consultant reports, general correspondence including inquiries and permissions, conservation, research fellowships, and more. The container list below includes further content description at the box level.</p>

                    <head>Arrangement Note</head>
                    <p>The series is arranged by individual principally associated with a set of files, in rough chronological order.</p>
                    <p>Reflecting her two separate tenures at N-YHS, Jean Ashton’s files are in two sets, designated in the container list as Jean Ashton I (1985-1993) and Jean Ashton II (2003-2013).</p>
                    <p>Margaret Heilbrun’s files are presented in four sets that reflect the state of the records as found by the processing archivist in 2016. There is significant overlap in the content and date range of the sets. Set 1 includes relatively well-structured subject files in alphabetical order that date primarily, though not exclusively, from Heilbrun’s tenure as head of the Library. Set 2 includes a less structured mix of subject matter that date primarily, though not exclusively from Heilbrun’s years as curator of manuscripts prior to leading the Library. Set 3 includes records from her last two years at N-YHS. Set 4 includes various materials associated with Heilbrun and Heilbrun’s years in the Library that were compiled from loose and unorganized documents by the processing archivist in 2016.</p>

                    <p>Records in this series through 1982 are open to qualified researchers. In accordance with a standard NYHS restriction that Board of Trustees and Executive Office files will be closed for 35 years following the departure of a President and Chief Executive Officer, those portions of the record group dating from 1983 and later are restricted. Materials from 1983-1988 pertain to the years of Director James B. Bell's administration, so the restriction dates from the end of that period; those records will open in 2024. The records related to administrations subsequent to Bell will be opened as the 35 year restriction relevant to their tenure passes. Prior to the records being opened, they may be used only by, or with the permission of, the President and Chief Executive Officer, her designee, or in the case of this series, the Vice President and Director of the Patricia D. Klingenstein Library.</p>

                    <p>Subseries VIII.A. Curatorial &amp; Administrative Files (1950s-2015)</p>
                    <p>Subseries VIII.B. Exhibition Files (1940-2014)</p>
                    <p>Subseries VIII.C. Loans (1984-2015)</p>
                    <p>The exhibition files in subseries VIII.B are those that were maintained as standalone sets of files, or at least were found in that way during archival processing in 2016. Exhibition files found integrated with a curator’s general files remain there and so can be found in subseries VIII.A.</p>

                    <p>The Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC) series includes files maintained by the curators and directors of the department, commonly referred to in the records as the Print Room. These records principally concern exhibitions, both those curated by PPAC staff and those mounted by the museum and other library units to which PPAC contributed. The series also includes records of loans from the Print Room to other institutions. Also included are files concerning the collections (e.g., acquisitions, conservation, surveys, inventories, cataloging projects) and administrative matters (e.g., budgets, reports, memos, statistics).</p>

                    <p>The Mary Beth Betts files were arranged and placed in archival folders at some point, perhaps circa 2004. Most of the other documents remain in their original files, with their arrangement refined by project archivist Larry Weimer in 2016. Many of the documents associated here with Dale Neighbors, especially those concerning the Zinkham guide, were found loose in 2016, and were arranged and foldered by Larry Weimer.</p>
                    <p>Additional exhibition files were transferred to the archives in 2017 and 2018 by curator Marilyn Kushner and were processed into the record group by Larry Weimer.</p>

                    <p>From 1989 to 1998 the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC) was a unit of N-YHS’s Museum Department, rather than the Library Department. Accordingly, records related to PPAC (also known as the Print Room) can be found in New-York Historical Society Museum Department records (NYHS-RG 20).</p>

                    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
                    <p>Although prints, photographs and architectural plans have been collected at N-YHS since the nineteenth century, the institutional history of what is now known as the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC) begins more recently, in 1939. In that year, N-YHS opened its newly expanded and renovated building on Central Park West. Within the larger space, a new room was designated the “Map and Print Room” to house the collection (which included photographs even though the word was absent from the “M&amp;P” Room’s title). More importantly, staff was hired and assigned to the care of these collections. At the same time, as the professional staff expanded throughout N-YHS, an organizational division developed between the Library and the Museum, each gaining its own head who reported to the chief executive officer, then called the Director. Prior to 1938, both branches of N-YHS’s cultural resources reported to the Librarian. The Map and Print Room did not form a third branch, remaining within Library management.</p>
                    <p>Over the following decades, the scope of the collections of the Map and Print Room evolved with institutional changes. Responsibility for architecture was added from the Manuscript Department while maps were transferred to the Reading Room. Drawings were transferred to the Museum while the Bella Landauer collection was added. Landauer’s collection of business and advertising ephemera came to N-YHS in 1926. It too was housed in a separate room at Central Park West where Landauer continued to add to the collection and work on it as honorary curator until her death in 1960. By 1973, Wilson Duprey was no longer Curator of Maps and Prints, but simply Curator of Prints. Similarly, the Map and Print Room became known as the Print Room, a name that, although referring to a physical location, has stuck informally over time to refer to the print, photograph and architecture collections and staff more generally. Certainly, in the records of this series and the institutional records overall, reference to Print Room will be commonly found, as in the title of the 1983 
                        <emph render="italic">Print Room Collection Guide</emph>, an unpublished in-house finding aid.</p>
                    <p>The 1980s and 1990s, the years that are most extensively documented at present in this series, saw significant developments in the management of these collections. In terms of overall responsibility, in the early 1980s executive management considered transferring the Print Room collections from the Library to the Museum, but with no appetite for this within either department, the move did not take place. But this proved to be just a postponement as the transfer eventually did occur, in 1989. As part of a reorganization of N-YHS at that time, a number of functions were consolidated under the leadership of the new Museum Director, Holly Hotchner. With their transfer to the Museum, the Print Room collections and staff took on a new name, which remains today: the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC).</p>
                    <p>PPAC remained with the Museum only eight years, transferring back to the Library in 1998, where it remains today. Yet during that brief time, several important initiatives were implemented. In 1992, Helena Zinkham, a former curator of prints in PPAC, completed her work on a preliminary guide to the print, photograph and architecture collection. Initially only an in-house guide, funds were eventually raised for the publication of the 
                        <emph render="italic">Guide</emph> in 1997. Wendy Shadwell, who had been Curator of Prints since 1974, was joined by two additional experts, Mary Beth Betts as Curator of Architectural Collections (1990-1999) and Dale Neighbors as Curator of Photography (1987-1998). The extent of surveying and cataloging of the collections increased, as did exhibitions drawing on them, including 
                        <emph render="italic">McKim, Mead &amp; White's New York</emph> (1991) and 
                        <emph render="italic">Building City Hall: Competition, Construction and Context</emph> (1992). With the shift of PPAC back to the Library in 1998, PPAC continued both in its traditional role of providing material in support of exhibitions mounted by the Museum and Library, as well as installing exhibitions based on its collections. And under the leadership of Marilyn Kushner, PPAC’s Curator and Head since 2006, the department has moved beyond these boundaries, perhaps most notably in Dr. Kushner’s curatorship of the landmark 
                        <emph render="italic">Armory Show at 100</emph> exhibition and its related Internet-based resources.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                        <p>This subseries includes files of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century curators and directors of the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC), referred to commonly in the records and in the institution as the Print Room. Specifically, the subseries includes files of Curator of Prints Wendy Shadwell (1974-2002), Curator of Architecture Mary Beth Betts (1990-1999), Curators of Photographs Dale Neighbors (1987-1998) and Holly Hinman (1998-2004?), and Directors Pamela Dewey (1998-2000?) and Valerie Komor (2000-2003). The date ranges indicate the time the individual held the position, not necessarily the date range of the records held in their files. The records, although associated here with particular individuals, commonly hold documents from their predecessors and likely also include files of other individuals that mixed in over time.</p>
                        <p>The files hold a range of materials concerning exhibitions, collections, conservation, and administrative matters. The container list provides summary descriptions for the principal subject content that is held within each box. The content can be further summarized as follows:</p>
                        <p>Wendy Shadwell’s files include the broadest range of materials over the longest period of time. These files include internal memos, statistics, monthly reports, planning documents, budgets, consultant reports, collection inventories, acquisition documentation, reference inquiries, presentations to school groups, and conservation matters. The acquisition documents include index cards maintained by Shadwell’s predecessor with notes on donations from 1969-1974.</p>
                        <p>Mary Beth Betts’s files center on the architectural collections and primarily include her working files for several exhibitions, especially 
                            <emph render="italic">McKim, Mead &amp; White's New York</emph> and 
                            <emph render="italic">Building City Hall: Competition, Construction and Context</emph>, which drew on the John McComb collection. Betts’s files also include correspondence related to the architectural collections and grants, particularly for Cass Gilbert-related projects. Associated with Betts, though not directly attributed to her files in the container list, are cataloging worksheets for the McComb, Pollard, Davis and Cass Gilbert collections.</p>
                        <p>Dale Neighbors’s files also include exhibition-related material, especially related to the 1995 gallery re-opening 
                            <emph render="italic">Treasury of the Past</emph>. Various exhibition possibilities are documented here, including some material for the planning in the late 1990s of a rotation of core New York City history-themed exhibitions. Likely in connection with one of these possibilities is a set of mounted newspaper photograph clippings apparently from the 1950s-1970s and at least in part from a series "New York's Changing Scene." Some administrative files relevant to the photograph collections are found here, including grants, acquisition possibilities, planning, and facilities. In connection with this last subject, there are three oversize plans from architect Richard Jansen for the existing and planned lay-out of the Print Room (1990).</p>
                        <p>Neighbors’s files also hold documentation of two projects: Helena Zinkham’s 
                            <emph render="italic">A Guide to Print, Photograph, Architectural and Ephemera Collections at N-YHS</emph> and consideration of creating a "daybook"/calendar with photographs and other images from the collections. The Zinkham records include correspondence, inventories, drafts, and other materials concerning the development of her unpublished preliminary Guide (1992) and the final published edition (1998).</p>
                        <p>Files from Neighbors’s successor, Holly Hinman, primarily include information on various then-active photographers, likely in connection with potential acquisitions or exhibition. Many of the files have color slides, photographic prints, or digital media of the photographers’ works; the container list entry includes the names of those photographers with such media in the files. Also included in the subseries are files concerning various surveys of the collections of negatives.</p>
                        <p>The Pamela Dewey and Valerie Komor files include grant proposals for conservation, digitization, and other matters; processing and project plans for cataloging and other description initiatives, including the monthly status reports for the Mellon-funded visual materials cataloging project; general correspondence and internal memos; collection descriptions, such as inventories, lists, surveys, counts, and acquisitions/donations; and administrative issues, such as the move of the Print Room to the 2nd floor. These files also include reports from the Mellon-funded studies on contemporary/contemporaneous collecting and information about the Landauer collection, such as the transfer of objects to the museum and a folder of clippings and original magazines with articles dating from the 1940s-70s, among other documents.</p>
                        <p>The subseries also holds files concerning the “Here is New York” collection and, to a lesser extent, the 2007 exhibition of the same name.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                        <p>The subseries includes sets of exhibition files that were maintained as standalone sets of files, or at least were found in that way during archival processing in 2016. The earliest files, from the 1940s and 1950s, appear to have been compiled at a later date by Wendy Shadwell and often include photographs of objects and the exhibition galleries. Later files often include photocopies of images of objects, but not of the galleries. Generally, the records are working files recording selections from the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (i.e., PPAC, or sometimes referred to as the Print Room) for museum and library exhibitions and the return of the items to the Print Room. Later files have the call slips for the selected documents. Many of the files have checklists, text, some research files, etc. The container list includes notes indicating those exhibitions that appear to have folders with more substantive or extensive documentation; the exhibition names used in the container list generally come from the original folder labels and likely do not match the actual exhibition titles precisely.</p>
                        <p>A particularly rich set of documents in this subseries relates to the 2013 exhibition 
                            <emph render="italic">The Armory Show at 100</emph>. The subseries holds the files of exhibition curator Marilyn Kushner, which include checklists, loan documentation, design plans, publicity, and other documents.</p>
                        <p>Subsequent to the major processing project in 2016, additional files of exhibitions curated or organized by the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture from 2016 and later were transferred to the archives and these are included in the subseries as well.</p>

                    <p>The series includes three principal sets of records from the library’s conservation lab. First are the lab’s files of outgoing loans and in-house exhibitions from 1989 to 2005. Second are the files (1990-1993) of Associate Librarian for Preservation Duane Watson and those of his colleague, Stacks Manager Christine Seeto. Finally, there are records of a daguerreotype (cased images) conservation survey from 1992-1993.</p>
                    <p>The outgoing loan files are generally fairly slender, with uneven content. Many include conservation treatment notes, but others include just the record of the approved loan or general correspondence about the loans. Some post-2000 files include color slides of the loaned objects. In-house exhibition files tend to be more extensive, reflecting the broader involvement of the lab with these activities. These exhibition files commonly include not only condition and treatment reports, but also basic information about the objects in relation to the exhibition, including labels, checklists, display logistics, etc. The loan and exhibition files include folder lists at the front of each box.</p>
                    <p>The Watson records are generally of a more administrative and broader nature, and less focused on individual objects. Watson’s records include budgets, survey results, performance statistics, internal memos, conservation reference material, grants, and grant project activities. Seeto’s records are concerned with stack surveys, movements of material within the stacks and other such logistical matters.</p>

                    <p>Outgoing loans and exhibition files are presented first. They are in their original folders and original order, which is chronological. These are followed by a carton of detailed records of a daguerreotype survey. Watson’s and Seeto’s records close the series. Watson’s files are in their original folders and original order, which is alphabetical by subject. Seeto’s files are also in their original folders and original order, which seems to have no particular arrangement.</p>

                    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
                    <p>Aside from a bindery that operated from 1929 until about 1960, N-YHS had no in-house conservation unit until the mid-1980s when it began to build such a staff, initially for the museum. Professional conservators arrived in the library when paper and book conservation labs were opened in early 1989. In 1990, Duane Watson was hired as Associate Librarian for Preservation, a position he held until he left N-YHS in early 1993. In this position, Watson was responsible for overseeing object-level conservation efforts for the library and the management of the collection in the stacks. This latter responsibility was carried out in the early 1990s principally by Stacks Manager Christine Seeto. Down to the present (2016), N-YHS’s library has continued to maintain a conservation lab, headed since the mid-1990s by chief conservator, Alan Balicki. Among the conservation staff’s many responsibilities has been the assessment of outgoing loans of objects (e.g., conditions of objects, proper housing, conditions at the borrower site) and preparation of objects for in-house exhibitions.</p>

                    <p>The Public Service series primarily includes the visitor sign-in registers for the library’s main Reading Room and its separate Print Room. The bulk of these date from the twentieth century, but there are some registers from the nineteenth century. From the nineteenth century, the series also holds a Librarian Receipt Book used to record books borrowed by the members and admission tickets and cards of introduction for non-members.</p>
                    <p>Although the series hold correspondence and print-outs of emails with reference inquiries, the bulk of these are from recent years and are therefore restricted and not available for public access. Some such letters from the 1950s-1970s are in the series and are available.</p>

                    <p>Reference correspondence for the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries can be found in the central correspondence files maintained by N-YHS; see New-York Historical Society General Correspondence (NYHS-RG 2). Reference correspondence from the mid-twentieth century can be found in the New-York Historical Society Librarian Dorothy C. Barck records (NYHS-RG 19). Some inquiries and correspondence concerning permissions to quote from N-YHS resources, principally that answered by curatorial staff, can also be found in the other series of this record group.</p>

                        <p>The subseries primarily includes the books or loose sheets that visitors were required to sign when using N-YHS’s resources, principally in connection with access to the library’s holdings. The bulk of these records date from about 1909-2010 and record both member and non-member use of the library. A few records from the nineteenth and early twentieth century, from as early as 1838, include non-member visits, but there are relatively few of these, and there are sizable gaps in the date coverage. These records hold only spare indicators of individual visits, with no details such as specific resources used. Any such detailed records that might exist are not held in the institutional archive.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the required sign-ins, the subseries includes a ceremonial “Register of Distinguished Visitors” that includes signatures from three events: the 1939 opening of the renovated N-YHS building, the 1954 dinner held at the Union Club to celebrate N-YHS’s 150th anniversary, and the 1957 event for the 200th anniversary of Lafayette’s birth. Other registers include visitor comment books (1990-1992, 2005-2007) on the galleries and various exhibitions. The subseries does not include comment books from specific exhibitions; these can be found with the files of the pertinent exhibition, principally in the New-York Historical Society Museum Department records (NYHS-RG 20).</p>
                        <p>The subseries also includes various documents related to visitors and access to N-YHS resources. These include a Librarian Receipt Book in which books borrowed from the library, a member privilege in the organization’s early years, were recorded (1829-1853); daily visitor counts from certain periods (1869, 1918-1937, and 1987-1990); and member and non-member admission cards (mostly undated but likely from the mid-late 1800s).</p>
