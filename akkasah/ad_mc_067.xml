    <head>Content Description</head>
<p>A collection of photographs most likely taken by the person who appears on the first page, who identifies themselves as a "a British Representative" of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) at the Little Aden oil refinery. The photographs focus on group and individual portraits of workers and locals and the equipment and facilities connected to the construction of the oil refinery at Little Aden, which began operating in July 1954. There are distressing photographs of a worker crushed by equipment and another suffering what appears to be exhaustion, as well as a truck crushed by a landslide.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Besides the note that the photographer is a "British representative" of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), there is no additional information about his position or background.
It is noteworthy that AIOC was renamed to the "British Petroleum Company" at the end of the Abadan Crisis in 1954, the same year that the Little Aden oil refinery was opened.</p>  </bioghist>
