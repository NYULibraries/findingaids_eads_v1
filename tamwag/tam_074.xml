            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Edward K. Welsh (1902-1979) began his career as a union organizer in 1930. In the 1940s, he was hired by the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) to organize workers in the steel, auto, and textile industries in the United States. He later organized laborers at the Panama Canal Zone. In 1961, the AFL-CIO sent Welsh to Africa as part of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) to assist various African trade union movements. He spent three and a half years in Africa. The collection mainly documents Welsh's trade union work in the United States and Africa, but also reflects some of his nonunion activities.</abstract>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Edward K. Welsh (1902-1979) was born in New York City in 1902. As a teenager, he worked at the old Metropolitan Opera House, opening carriage doors for opera-goers. He also worked as a laborer, ditch digger, elevator operator, store clerk, shipping clerk, and longshoreman.</p>
            <p>Welsh's career in the labor movement began in 1930, when he worked as a volunteer organizer for the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), Local 22 (dressmakers). Soon he became involved in radical politics, traveling with Communist Party notable Jay Lovestone and others to the Soviet Union. During that visit, Stalin hoped to secure Welsh as one of communism's supporters among African Americans in the United States. However, Welsh's close-up exposure to Soviet society caused him to alter his political allegiance. Nevertheless, his concern for workers' rights led him to continue to carry out his activism in the labor movement through writing, speaking and teaching.</p>
            <p>During the 1940s, Welsh was appointed to the staff of Allan Haywood, vice president and director of organization of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), where he organized workers in the steel, auto, and textile industries in the South and in Ohio.</p>
            <p>In 1950, Welsh was sent to the Panama Canal Zone by CIO president Philip Murray to organize workers there. With Welsh's help, 5,500 workers were enrolled in Local 900 of the Government and Civic Employees Organizing Committee within a year. In 1953, Welsh returned to New York City, where he organized office workers. He later moved to Detroit, where he conducted worker education and political action programs.</p>
            <p>The CIO merged with the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1955. In 1961, AFL-CIO president George Meany assigned Welsh to the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU). Welsh's job was to assist trade union movements in Africa, specifically in Tanganyika (now Tanzania), Kenya, and Uganda. During this period, the AFL-CIO sought out African union leaders to further the United States' political and economic interests in Africa. Sanctioned by the Department of State and the CIA, African labor leaders were given secret undercover support.</p>
            <p>Welsh spent three and a half years in Africa organizing agricultural, textile, hotel, and building and construction workers. He returned to the United States in 1964 to work with taxicab drivers and hospital workers in New York City before retiring three years later. Welsh died in February 1979 at the age of 77.</p>

            <p>Photographs separated from this collection during initial processing and from additional accessions were established as a separate collection, the Edward K.

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>Roughly half of the collection chronicles Welsh's trade union work in both the United States and Africa for the CIO, AFL-CIO, and the ICFTU. Genres of materials which document these activities include correspondence, reports, photographs, minutes, speeches, and other materials. Earlier files from the 1930s through 1950s shed light on Welsh's organizing efforts in the United States for the CIO and the AFL-CIO, as well as some of his nonunion activities and his work in Panama. Later files from the late 1950s and 1960s focus on the ICFTU and Welsh's involvement with the organization. The other half of the collection consists of collected pamphlets, periodicals, and newspapers on trade union activities in Africa, spanning from the 1950s to the 1970s.</p>
            <p>Many files in the collection provide insight into the formation and development of the trade union movements in African countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Liberia, and Tanganyika (now Tanzania); criticism by African affiliates of the ICFTU administration; and the split between the All-African Trade Union Federation and the ICFTU. The papers also document conspiracy and bribery charges within the Kenya Federation of Labour, some of which implicate the CIA.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Series III: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) Files, 1958-1971</emph> includes correspondence, telegrams, reports, agendas, circulars, speeches, photographs, documentation of financial transactions, and news releases. Of particular interest is material on Welsh's appointment as ICFTU representative in Africa and reports on union activities in Liberia, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Also included is a list of ICFTU field representatives in Africa, Asia, and Latin America; a draft of the Constitution of the Confederation of East African Trade Unions; a report on the First All-African Trade Union Conference; and records of the Pan-African Trade Congress held in Casablanca in 1961. Additional documents deal with CIA involvement in Kenya; the formation of the African Labour College in Uganda, which provided educational training for trade unionists in Africa; and the opposition to Tom Mboya's affiliation with the ICFTU by African countries that wanted to operate independently. The series also includes speeches made by heads of African states at a summit conference held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 1963; a description of union activity and efforts to create a national trade union center in the Sudan; and financial accounts and a proposed program of organization and education within the Kenya Federation of Labour.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Series IV: African Pamphlets and Periodicals, 1956-1972</emph> concern trade union activities in East and West African countries. Most of the pamphlets relate to nonunion activities, but there are a few pamphlets published by the ICFTU, the International Labor Organization (ILO), and the United Nations. There are three folders of miscellaneous pamphlets and periodicals with no direct bearing on trade unions in Africa. These publications will serve researchers interested in the trade union movement from an African perspective.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Series VII: Photographs</emph> is comprised of black-and-white photographs that document Welsh's work for the CIO, AFL-CIO, and other labor organizations in Panama, Africa, and the United States, especially during the 1950s and 1960s. The series contains group shots and portraits of Welsh, mostly from his years in Africa. The images from Panama include shots of various meetings, banquets, and speeches (including several from the March of Dimes), as well as photographs of seamen at the Panama Canal. There are also images from the Summit of Independent African States in Addis Abbaba, Ethiopia in May 1963 and three images from a folder labeled "Pictures - Africa," which consist of a group portrait featuring Welsh, an image of Welsh and another man holding up an embroidered shirt, and a candid photograph of Welsh and other men at the 14th Constitutional Convention of the CIO in 1952. Other images in the series are mostly photographs taken by news services of contemporary events in African nations during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as a few postcards and some group shots and portraits of various individuals.</p>
