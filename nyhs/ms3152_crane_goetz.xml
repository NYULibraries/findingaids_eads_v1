<p>Cornell Law School graduate Stephen G. Crane (J.D., 1963) practiced law in New York City from 1963 until 1981, when he became a Judge for the Criminal Court of the City of New York. Crane was appointed Acting State Supreme Court Justice in 1984, and served in that position through 1989, during which time he presided over the controversial trial of so-called "Subway Vigilante" Bernhard H. Goetz. Crane became a Supreme Court Justice in 1990, and served as Administrative Judge of Supreme Court, Civil Branch for New York County from 1996 until 2001. That year, he was designated an Additional Justice for the Appellate Division, Second Department, and in 2005 was officially designated as an Associate Justice for that Court. He was promoted to Senior Associate Justice for the Appellate Division, Second Department in 2008, the year he retired.</p><p>On December 22, 1984, Bernhard Goetz, a white, 37-year-old electronics engineer riding the No. 2 subway, shot four African American youths—Barry Allen, Troy Canty, Darrell Cabey, and James Ramseur—who asked him for money. Goetz was indicted for attempted murder, and his subsequent trial brought intense debate to the subjects of self-defense and public safety. Some members of the public painted the shooter as a hero fighting the dangers of urban crime. Others viewed him as a depraved vigilante whose excessive force was racially motivated. Although Darrell Cabey was left paralyzed and brain-damaged by the shooting, Goetz was acquitted of attempted murder, and found guilty only of illegal possession of a handgun. He was sentenced to a year in prison (he served eight months at Riker's Island) and five years' probation.</p><p>==============================</p><p>This note is adapted from Justice Stephen G.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Aside from the trial docket books in Series I, which record proceedings heard by Justice Stephen G. Crane in the Criminal Court of the City of New York (1981–1983) and New York State Supreme Court (1984–2000), the bulk of this collection centers on the criminal trial of "Subway Vigilante" Bernhard Goetz (1985–1987). Series II includes subject files on various aspects of <emph render="italic">The People v. Goetz</emph>, containing such material as handwritten notes, photocopies of laws and precedents, court documents, and scattered correspondence. More focused correspondence—much of it from interested members of the public who offered Crane their opinions both for and against Goetz (in sometimes racially-tinged language)—may be found in Box 6, Folders 1–8. And extensive newspaper clippings on the Goetz case, trial, and sentencing, may be found in Box 5, Folders 8–47. A copy of the official 9,505-page trial transcript fills three record cartons and provides minute coverage of the proceedings; see Box 8, Folder 1 for a detailed table of contents and an index to witness testimony. The collection also includes two unusual, autographed mementos of the Goetz trial (see Series IV). One, a 108-inch-long computer printout, presents the jury's admonition or oath with an inscription "To Justice Stephen G. Crane with respect and admiration" and signatures of the jurors and alternates. The other, a remnant of the jury box from the courtroom at 111 Centre Street, Manhattan, where the Goetz trial took place, is a 99-inch-long wooden plank signed by all the participants (excluding the victims): the judge, the jurors, their alternates, the attorneys, court officers and reporters, and the defendant, Bernhard Goetz, himself. See the note at Series IV for a description of this item's creation.</p>  </scopecontent>

For details of the proceedings, see Crane's Supreme Court Trial Docket Book covering January 21, 1988 through March 15, 1989 (Box 2, Vol. V).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_901e2e6dfaf906f90450f145a9501022" level="file"><did><unittitle>Clippings.

Bernhard Goetz, including the defendant. Accompanied by the following description:</p><p>========================================</p><p>This is the actual remnant of the jury box in the courtroom at 111 Centre Street where the trial of <emph render="italic">People v Bernhard Goetz</emph> transpired. The jury box as originally constructed was too tall to permit the jurors to see exhibits displayed in the well of the court. As the trial proceeded this became evident (Transcript p. 5053). As a result, the clerk of the part, Robert Hamkalo, arranged with the New York City Department of General Services, as it then was called, to cut down the jury box overnight. He sought this unprecedented cooperation by informing the representatives of DGS that Judge Crane would praise the Department to the world press assembled in the courtroom if they accomplished this task; but if not the judge would have to inform the audience of the reason why the jury box continued to obstruct the view of the jurors. The next morning, May 1, 1987, a sign on the diminished jury box read "Don't Touch. Varnish Wet." Judge Crane, off the record, made the promised remarks to the audience and later, on the record (Transcript p. 5293–4) congratulated Bob Hamkalo and told the jurors that the diminished jury box should "enhance your abilities to discharge your obligations as the trial continues in being able to see the exhibits that are produced in the well of the court…and to be able to see the witnesses as they are on the witness stand." Following the day's proceedings, the Deputy Chief Administrative Judge for the Courts Within the City of New York, Milton Williams, called Judge Crane to ask how he accomplished the down-sizing of the jury box because he, Judge Williams, had been requesting this remedy for all the jury boxes at 111 Centre Street for the past 7 years!</p><p>It was also the idea of the clerk of the part to obtain the signatures of all the participants in the trial on each of the three boards that formed the excess height of the jury box.
