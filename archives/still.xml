            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The bulk of this collection documents Dr. Bayrd Still’s professional life, containing correspondence, published and unpublished articles and speeches, historical research documentation, and information regarding Still’s professional associations and early career. The collection also reflects Still’s involvement with the New York City Landmarks project from 1957-1983.</p>
            <p>The collection is arranged according to six series: Subject Files, Publications, Urban History Research, Professional and Academic Papers, Correspondence, and Landmark Projects. The Bayrd Still Papers and the Landmarks Collection were originally two discrete collections before they were merged. This finding aid is based on the arrangement of the collections that was established in 2001, but additional description reflects the original file categories and titles that Still used in his inventory.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I</emph>: Subject, Historical Reference, &amp; Personal Files, 1950-1979 (Boxes 1-13). It is likely that the contents of this series originated in Bayrd Still's office in the NYU History Department. Boxes 1-8 contain files that are arranged neither in chronological nor in alphabetical order. This group of files reflects Still's various interactions with NYU and the NYC community at professional and personal levels. These files might contain information pertinent to other series in the collection. Boxes 9-11 are arranged alphabetically from A-W and form a group that Still entitled "Historical Reference File". Boxes 9-11 are missing a number of folders that are noted in the original inventory. Boxes 12-13 are restricted as they contain evaluations of students and colleagues of Still. Dr. Still titled this group "Personal-Current."</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series II</emph>: Research, Committees, Talks, Reviews, &amp; Still's Articles (Boxes 14-22) Boxes 14-16 contain publications by various writers on urban history; each collected article is filed in a separate folder. Boxes 16 and 17 contain research on urban history that includes statistics, travel accounts (possibly from primary sources), maps, and charts. Box 18 contains administrative files pertinent to Bayrd Still’s years as acting dean. Box 18 and 19 include files on Still’s talks, as well as press and reviews, some of which relate to Still’s own publications. Boxes 20-22 contain Still’s own publications, a group that he titled: "Partial Collection of Articles in Historical Journals".</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series III</emph>: NYC Research (Boxes 23-37e) Box 23 contains information on NYC landmarks. Boxes 23-29 contain urban history research material that includes some original material, some published sources, and some of Still's own translations of published material. Still titled the files in boxes 29-37a "Cities in American Thought and Experience" (see Still’s guide for his detailed description of the contents). The files contain published and unpublished sources about urbanism and urban development in the United States from the seventeenth century to the twentieth century; they are arranged in chronological order. Boxes 37a-37e contain clippings, correspondence, and other materials related to Still’s book 
                <emph render="italic">Urban America</emph> and Greenwich Village Walking Tour. Box 37b (folders 14 - 44) and Box 37c (folders 1 to 64) include clippings and other materials arranged alphabetically by subject--most relate to New York City. Box 37c (folders 65 to 75) relates to Still's Greenwich Village walking tour. Box 37c (folders 76 to 80) and Box 37d contain illustrations and information regarding permissions for 
                <emph render="italic">Urban America</emph>. These folders are arranged alphabetically by the name of the organization. Box 37e contains information relating to the publication of 
                <emph render="italic">Urban America</emph>. The files include correspondence with Still's publisher, Little, Brown &amp; Co., as well as expense reports and style sheets.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series IV</emph>: Speeches, Reviews, Doctoral Students, Mayoral Research, &amp; NYU Archives (Boxes 38-48) Box 38-40: The majority of these materials are speeches that Still gave before various historical organizations. Additionally, the materials contain publications, correspondence, and information regarding Still's professional associations. Note: Box 55 (folder 30) contains a Lincoln Center program with a rough draft of a speech or paper written on the inside pages. Boxes 41-44 contain Still's files on his doctoral students. These are restricted. Boxes 44-45 contain Still's NYC Mayoral Research. Boxes 46-48 include more of Still’s talks and articles, as well as files that document his work with the NYU Archives.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series V</emph>: Chronological Correspondence (Box 49-51) This series contains Still's correspondence dating from 1949 to 1979.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VI</emph>: Landmarks This series measures 2.6 linear feet and is comprised of 5 boxes. The collection is composed of correspondence, articles, press releases, reports, some photographs, minutes, and calendars concerning the landmarks marking project of the New York Community Trust, the Committee for the Preservation of Structures of Historical and Esthetic Importance, and the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The material spans the years 1957-1983, with the bulk of the material concentrated in the years 1957-1970.</p>
            <p>Most of the correspondence contained in the collection is between Dr. Bayrd Still and Ralph Hayes, the executive director of New York Community Trust. This material spans the years 1961-1970, although Mr. Hayes resigned from his position with Community Trust in 1967. The content of the correspondence centers upon the discussion of various sites and buildings in connection with their landmark potential. There are also letters that discuss the New York University fellowship sponsored by the Community Trust. Such letters relate to the various graduate students who were nominated for and/or awarded the fellowship, as well as the discussion of funds appropriated. The additional correspondence includes letters from the graduate fellows, concerning progress reports, inquiries, and recommendations. The graduate student correspondence is restricted.</p>
            <p>The articles and press releases document the landmarking project as it unfolded, and indicate the various buildings and sites that received landmark plaques. Such items can be found throughout the collection spanning many years. The New York University graduate students who worked on the landmark project completed the reports. These reports focus on the affiliation between New York City locations and particular historical personae, such as United States Presidents. The photos that accompany two of these reports regarding United State Presidents and United States Vice-Presidents have been separated and can be found in the University Archives photo collection.</p>
            <p>There are some minutes and lists of recommendations from the Committee for the Preservation of Structures of Historical and Esthetic Importance, which met from June-November 1961. These notes outline the discussions regarded the formation of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. There are also some minutes from the meetings of the Landmarks Preservation Commission that span the years 1962-1965.</p>
            <p>The calendars are from the Landmarks Preservation Commission. They were published to announce the public hearings that were held to decide the status of various sites. The Community Trust looked at these calendars to find buildings they had not considered or had passed over for designation.</p>
            <p>Copies of some of the early calendars can be found in Box 1, amongst the correspondence, and through Box 4. The collection of calendars is not complete, but it does begin with the first copy of September 21, 1965, and runs through 1980. In 1981 the Landmark Preservation Commission began putting out the 
                <emph render="italic">Landmark News</emph>. Some copies through 1983 are in the collection. There are also statute drafts and articles pertaining to the landmarks preservation law, which the commission worked to formulate, and which was passed in 1965.</p>
            <p>In Box 3, folder 4 entitled "Brooklyn Heights Association: Proposal for designation of historic district," there is a map and proposal draft pertaining to the amending of zoning regulations in order to designate and protect the area referred to as "Old Brooklyn Heights." In the previous folder, there are some references to this move taken by the association. Cross-reference sheets mark this information. It appears that the moves of the association were made known to the Landmarks Preservation Commission and that the area was designated as a landmark in 1962, but their involvement in the Brooklyn Heights proposal is unknown.</p>
            <p>In Box 3, folder 7, entitled "New York City Council for Landmark's Preservation", there is one press release concerning the call for emergency action to save the Percy R. Pyne landmark group from a demolition threat. It is dated December 12, 1964. It is unclear what the connection is between this council and the Landmarks Preservation Commission. This release was originally retained in a folder by itself and since there is some question as to its place within the collection, it has been kept in its own folder.</p>
            <p>Overall, the collection retains its original order. Most folders are arranged chronologically. Within the folders the material is arranged with the most current material on top. This was the original order of the material.</p>

            <head>Biography of Bayrd Still</head>
            <p>From 1947-1987, Dr. Bayrd Still served New York University as an historian, archivist, teacher, and administrator. As an authority on urban history and urban development, Dr. Still’s interests and commitments extended beyond his academic research and the university to involve landmark preservation in New York City.</p>
            <p>Bayrd Still was born on July 7, 1906, in Woodstock, Illinois. He completed all of his degrees in history at the University of Wisconsin; he received his bachelors and masters degrees in 1928 and 1929 respectively, and earned his Ph.D. in 1933. Before assuming his professorship at NYU, Still taught at Ohio Wesleyan University, the University of Wisconsin, and Duke University.</p>
            <p>From 1947-1974 Dr. Still was a professor at NYU in the department of history, for which he also served as chair from 1955-1970. In 1955 Still was appointed head of the undergraduate history department at University College as well as head of the graduate program of history. In 1957 he became head of the all-University department of history and remained so until 1970. Additionally, he served as acting dean for both the undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Arts and Science from 1958-1959, and again from 1959-1960. Throughout his teaching career, Still taught at both the University Heights campus and the Washington Square campus.</p>
            <p>President James M. Hester established the Office of the Archivist in 1967, appointing Thomas C. Pollock as University Archivist, and Bayrd Still as Chair of the Advisory Committee on the History of New York University. The Committee provided advice on matters regarding the writing of the history of the University. When Pollock resigned in 1969, Still declined the position of University Archivist, continuing instead as chair of the Advisory Committee. He played a key role in the founding of the University Archives project until 1975, when he finally assumed the title of University Archivist.</p>
            <p>Still was an authority on United States urban development and westward expansion. The courses he offered included "The History of the American City since 1820" and "The History of New York City." His publications include: 
                <emph render="italic">Urban America: A History with Documents</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Milwaukee, The History of a City</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Mirror for Gotham: New York as Seen by Contemporaries from Dutch Days to the Present</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">The West: Contemporary Records of America’s Expansion Across the Continent, 1609-1890</emph>.</p>
            <p>Still's interests in urban development were reflected in his commitments to projects that extended beyond the University. In 1961 Still served as supervisor for New York University graduate fellowships with the New York Community Trust, a landmarks marking project begun in 1956. In 1962 Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed Still to the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The duties of the commission included nominating sites to designate as landmarks and formulating the landmarks preservation law, which was eventually passed in 1965. Although Still resigned from the landmark commission in April of 1965, citing time constraints, he maintained a keen interest in the commission’s developments. Still also served on the Mayor's Task Force on Municipal Archives in New York. In 1975 he became the Chairman of the Advisory Board for the Brooklyn Rediscovery Project. He was a member of the New-York Historical Society, the American Studies Association, and the Society of American Historians. In the 1980s Still organized and conducted walking tours of NYU and Greenwich Village. Dr. Still died in Woodstock, Illinois, on November 19, 1992.</p>
