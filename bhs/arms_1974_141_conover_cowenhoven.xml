    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>The Cowenhoven family (alternate spellings include Couwenhoven, Kouwenhoven, and Covenhoven) were descended from the common ancestor Wolphert Gerritson Van Kouwenhoven, who emigrated from the Netherlands to the town of New Utrecht in the Dutch colony of New Netherland (later New York) in the 17th century. The Cowenhovens had ties to other Brooklyn families, including the Conover family and the Bergen family.</p>  </bioghist>
