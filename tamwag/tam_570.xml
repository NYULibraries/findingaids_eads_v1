Later, Gold was a Democratic Party leader in New York City's Village Independent Democrats and a member of Community Board 2. Gold worked for 40 years as a writer and editor at Fairchild Publications, and after retiring continued to write opinion columns for 
                <emph render="italic">The Villager</emph>. He was an early supporter of Ed Koch's political career, and headed the citywide Reform Democratic movement while serving as President of the Coalition of Democratic Voters.
