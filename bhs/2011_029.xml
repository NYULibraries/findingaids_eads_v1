The photographs date from circa 1850s to circa 1940 and include a variety of formats, such as tin types, cabinet cards, cartes-de-visite, and prints. In addition to the photographs, the collection contains genealogical records and two items relating to public schools in Lansingburgh, New York: a primary school class portrait (circa 1880s) and an autograph book (1890-1892), which features the signature of W.E.B. Du Bois. The Wibecan family originated from St. Croix and England, before settling in Brooklyn and becoming prominent members of the local Black community.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>George Edwin Wibecan (1832-1912) was born on St. Croix in the Danish West Indies and later immigrated to Liverpool, England. There he married Catherine Lawrence (1843-1916) in 1861. The couple had one child in England and then immigrated to Brooklyn, New York, where they had four more. Their second child, also George Edwin Wibecan, was born in Brooklyn in 1865. In 1899 he married Mabel Louise Bulkley (1875-1960) in Lansingburgh, New York, which was her home town. The couple resided on Pulaski Street in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, where they raised four children of their own. George was employed by the U.S. Postal Service for forty six years, and was a leader of the Henry Highland Garnet Republican Club, which was a Black Republican club based in Brooklyn. He died in Brooklyn, New York, in 1946.</p>  </bioghist>
