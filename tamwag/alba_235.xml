      <p>The first segment of the collection was donated in February 1996, labelled as TAM 181 and
        photographs were separated to the Ralph Fasanella Photographs (PHOTOS 157). When the ALBA
        collections were donated in December 2000, the collection was likely renumbered ALBA 235. In
        2005, a second addition was added to the collection.</p>
      <p>In 2013, the photograph collection was reincorporated into the Ralph Fasanella Papers and
        Photographs.</p>

        Workers of America (UE) Local 1227 while working as a machinist in Brooklyn. Fasanella also
        fought in the Spanish Civil War with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and after returning from
        the war began to work as a union organizer for the UE. Fasanella died on December 18,
        1997.</p>

      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection contains the photographs and papers of Ralph Fasanella, the bulk of which
        are from 1970-1993. There is some material from Spain during the Spanish Civil War. The
        collection contains correspondence from friends, activists, school children, and art world
        figures. Prominent correspondences include Milton Wolfe and Ernest DiMaio. Other materials
        in the collections include materials from Fasanella's 1949 campaign for New York City
        Council on the American Labor Party slate, exhibit materials including a guest book, lecture
        notes, press clippings on his career, research notes about Lawrence, Massachusetts,
        brochures, and an oversized magazine entitled, "Un Ano de las Brigadas Internacionales"
        (Spanish). A significant portion of the collection contains color and black-and-white
        photographs, some of Fasanella at work or a show. There are also some photographs of
        Fasanella and others taken in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. It also includes a jacket
        and trousers worn by Fasanella in Spain.</p>
