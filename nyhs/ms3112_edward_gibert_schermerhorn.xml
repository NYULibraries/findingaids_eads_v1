    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Edward Gibert Schermerhorn was born in New York City on November 22, 1864, the son of George S. and Julia Gibert Schermerhorn. He enlisted in the New York State National Guard's 7th Regiment, Company I (also referred to as 9th Company) in 1885 and served until August 1891. He remained at the rank of private throughout that time. Subsequent to his service he held the position of adjutant for various regiments, advancing to the rank of captain, until 1899 when he was designated a supernumerary.</p><p>In 1912, Schermerhorn was appointed by Governor-elect William Sulzer to be his Military Secretary, which seems to have been a form of civilian advisor on state military matters, that is, outside of the Adjutant General's Office. Sulzer's tenure as governor was brief as he was removed from office in October 1913 after being impeached and convicted. Consequently, Schermerhorn left the administration, successfully petitioning the legislature to allow him to return to the National Guard's supernumerary list with the rank of major, from which he had been removed when he entered Sulzer's administration.</p><p>Schermerhorn was a member of various veterans and other social/fraternal organizations, including the Saint Nicholas Society, Veteran Corps of Artillery, and the Military Society of the War of 1812. He was married to Charlotte Tiedemann, who died in 1943. Schermerhorn died in Bergen County, New Jersey, in 1949.</p><p>(The above note is based primarily on documents in the collection.)</p>  </bioghist>
