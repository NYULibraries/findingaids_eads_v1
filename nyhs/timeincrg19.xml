    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In the 1949 Time Inc. Department Heads List, the earliest in the archives, Corporate Publicity and the FYI company newsletter editor are listed as part of Corporate Special Projects. The listing remains the same through 1960 although Corporate Publicity increases in staff. In 1963 Publicity is listed as overseen by VP and Secretary Bernard Barnes. James Pitt is listed as director with several assistants, including Lucille Nunes. By 1966 Louis Slovinsky is also one of these assistants. In 1968, Publicity has moved under the President's office as part of corporate public affairs which is headed by Bernard Yudain with the title Assistant to the President for Public Affairs. Pitt and Slovinsky continue in their same roles. </p><p>In 1970 Time Inc. names Donald Wilson as the vice president of Corporate Public Affairs creating a new department overseeing a public affairs director, corporate contributions director, and the FYI editor. Robert Sweeney served as the first public affairs director in this new department with James Alberse as his deputy. By 1972 Slovinsky is listed as the public relations manager. In 1974 Stan Kapner replaces Alberse as deputy which is now called associate director. Marilyn Sahner joins as the radio/TV publicity manager, and Nunes joins as Midwest public affairs manager.  By 1978 Corporate Public Affairs includes the vice president of government affairs, public affairs director, Corporate Creative Services, and Corporate Contributions. Kapner has replaced Sweeney as public affairs director with Slovinsky as associate director as well as public relations manager. By 1980 Slovinsky is the public affairs director. In the 1980s, Corporate Public Affairs adds directors of public policy development, community policy development, tax policy development in 1983. A memo from CEO J. Richard Munro in September 1986 announces that Wilson, therefore Corporate Public Affairs, will begin reporting to Executive Vice President of Strategy and Planning Gerald "Jerry" Levin. By 1987 Corporate Public Affairs includes the positions of director of corporate community relations and chief speechwriter.</p><p>Corporate Community Relations created and implemented social programs that provide a service to the community, the largest being Time To Read; oversaw company sponsored volunteer programs; registered minority and women owned or operated businesses with the Time Inc. Minority Business Development Program and published a directory; and represented Time Inc. at meetings of organizations such as the Business Council for Effective Literacy, Magazine Publishers Association, and Corporate Volunteers Coordinators Council.</p><p>Corporate Contributions was formalized as an office in 1978 although Time Inc. had been granting funds since 1934. It awarded grants to non-project organizations in the areas of education, art and culture, civic and welfare needs, and the environment.</p><p>Corporate Creative Services produced films, presentations, and other materials for meetings such as the Board of Directors, personnel orientation, ATC Franchise Presentation, and <title render="italic">Time</title> Ad Sales. It also marketing the use of the Picgture Collection; consulted on the renovation of presentation spaces; and oversaw exhibits in the Time Inc. buildings or traveling exhibits sponsored by Time Inc. </p><p>Corporate Cultural Affairs oversaw exhibits sponsored by Time Inc., art commissions made by Time Inc., and cultural exchanges involving exhibitions; and reviewed requests for exhibit and art project corporate sponsorship. This office may have replaced Creative Services.</p><p>Government Relations monitored federal goverment activities and reported to Time Inc. executives on topics that affected the company such as taxes, cable providers, postal rates, business regularions, employee benefits, and advertising.</p>  </bioghist>

Records include financial and security analyst meeting agenda; briefing books, president's speeches, photographs, and questions and answers for the stockholders' annual meetings; background information and progress updates on joint ventures; background information, fact sheets, and press releases on Time Inc. publications, public programs, and departments; magazine media and advertising kits; and news clippings. </p><p>The administrative files are primarily from Slovinsky, but also include files or materials from Donald Wilson, Kerr, Pitt, Kapner, public affairs senior associate Ed Adler, and press information manager Michael Luftman. These files may have been inherited by Slovinsky, filed together by an office worker in Corporate Public Affairs prior to transfer to the Time Inc. Archives, or filed together by the Time Inc. Archives after receipt. For example, earlier Analyst Meeting and Stockholder Meeting files from Pitt were housed with later similarly titled files from Slovinsky. While the speeches folders have material similar to the Chief Speechwriter series, this material looks like it was collected by Slovinsky or a different part of Corporate Public Affairs and not the Chief Speechwriter.</p><p>Items of interest include a 1970 plan for pre-recorded video; a 1972 title list for Time-Life Video; and photographs of a 1972 stockholders meeting.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_ab79f7a442c2132810e45b3601137034"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Organized alphabetically with arrangement imposed.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref892_opn" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advertising Age: 100 Leading Advertisers</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="229556" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">229556</unitid><unitdate normal="1981/1988" type="inclusive">1981-1988</unitdate><container id="aspace_d80a8f8c3b3cfa19131d557160f2ed5b" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010984]" type="Offsite-Box">2100</container><container parent="aspace_d80a8f8c3b3cfa19131d557160f2ed5b" type="Folder">1-8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref893_n2z" level="file"><did><unittitle><title render="italic">Adweek</title></unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="229565" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">229565</unitid><unitdate normal="1981/1982" type="inclusive">1981-1982</unitdate><container id="aspace_ab24916576fa797a4d4460ce72fa3f3c" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010984]" type="Offsite-Box">2100</container><container parent="aspace_ab24916576fa797a4d4460ce72fa3f3c" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref696_wyq" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Television and Communications, Inc.
