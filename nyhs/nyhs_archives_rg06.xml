These images are primarily from sites in upper Manhattan and the Bronx and include such materials as buttons from American and British uniforms and coins from the Revolutionary War and War of 1812. Also included are images of Native American materials discovered. These materials informed and
illustrated the many articles written by William L. Calver and Reginald P. Bolton and published in N-YHS's <emph render="italic">Quarterly Bulletin</emph> during the Committee's existence from 1917-1938. The record group also includes a catalogue of objects compiled by Calver, with handwritten descriptions and drawings.</abstract>

<p>The Field Exploration Committee (FEC) was appointed in 1918 by the N-YHS Executive Committee and was comprised of six members of N-YHS: William L. Calver (Chairman), Samuel V. Hoffman (Vice-Chairman), Reginald P. Bolton (Secretary), Alexander J. Wall (Treasurer), Charles M. Lefferts, and Dr. William S. Thomas. The Committee continued the work done over the years by dedicated individuals living mainly in Washington Heights, Inwood, and the Bronx to collect colonial and Revolutionary War military artifacts. The FEC extended this work to the Hudson Highlands (Putnam, Dutchess, and Westchester counties). Calver and Bolton and others associated with them over the years excavated areas known to have been Revolutionary War and War of 1812 sites. They prepared annual reports of their explorations as well as published a series of articles for the Society's <emph render="italic">Quarterly Bulletin.</emph> The FEC discovered a great number of military relics, including buttons from soldier uniforms and coins. </p><p>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The New-York Historical Society Field Exploration Committee (FEC) photographs record group consists mainly of photographs and other images of objects of military character (e.g., American and British soldier uniform buttons, caps, leaden seals, and coins) connected with the events of the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. These objects were photographed and mounted for exhibitions (alongside labels included in the record group) at N-YHS and Morris-Jumel Mansion, which had served as Washington's headquarters during the Revolution. Much of the record group consists of glass plate negatives of various sizes, as well as film negatives of the military sites explored and objects discovered. </p><p>In addition to the photographs, the record group includes a catalogue of "objects found and studied by the Field Exploration Committee of the New-York Historical Society; also similar objects donated to, or otherwise acquired by, the Society." This catalogue was compiled by FEC Chairman William L. Calver and includes handwritten descriptions, drawings, and some photographs of the various found objects. This catalogue was formerly held within N-YHS's Museum Department and inventoried under the number INV.5765.</p><p>The majority of objects found and photographed were discovered at former Revolutionary camp sites in upper Manhattan (Washington Heights and Inwood) and the Bronx by the FEC at a time before construction of housing in those areas. These photos and accompanying documentation informed the series of articles written by William L. Calver and Reginald P. Bolton for the N-YHS <emph render="italic">Quarterly Bulletin</emph> publication between 1918 and 1938. Box 1 holds copies of the <emph render="italic">Bulletin</emph> issues that contain these articles. Included is<emph render="italic"> Relics of the Revolution, </emph> an agreement between Bolton and the Washington Headquarters Association (Morris-Jumel Museum) transferring ownership of Bolton's Collection of Revolutionary relics on exhibition in the Guard Room of Washington Headquarters to the Association.</p><p>The bulk of the negatives are 4 x 5 glass plates of photographs taken primarily by William L. Calver. Box 15 contains 5 x 7 film negatives of photographs taken by Calver and other individuals, and box 16 contains 8 x 10 glass negatives of photographs taken by various individuals. Each negative is held in an envelope that includes identifying information.   </p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The negatives were arranged and housed in boxes by conservation intern Sara Belasco in 2015. The image and writings files were processed and the entire record group described by Margaret Kaczorowski in November 2016. Calver's catalogue (INV.5765) was transferred to the archives from the Museum Department in December 2017 and was added to the record group at that time by archivist Larry Weimer.</p>  </processinfo>
