    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p><emph render="italic">PM</emph> (1940-48) was a progressive New York City daily tabloid format newspaper that supported the extension of the New Deal and good relations with the Soviet Union, and opposed U.S. foreign policy and the rise of the Cold War and of domestic anti-communism. <emph render="italic">PM</emph> (the name stood for Picture Magazine), borrowed many elements from weekly newsmagazines, and it accepted no advertising in an attempt to be free of pressure from business interests. <emph render="italic">PM</emph> was published by Ralph Ingersoll and financed by the Chicago millionaire Marshall Field III. Circulation averaged at 165,000, less than the 225,000 it would need to break even. Notable contributors included Heywood Broun, McGeorge Bundy, Erskine Caldwell, Malcolm Cowley, Ben Hecht, Ernest Hemingway, Penn Kimball, Eugene Lyons, Tip O'Neill, Saul K. Padover, Dorothy Parker, Ben Stolberg, I.F. Stone, James Thurber, James Wechsler, and cartoonist Theodore Geisel (aka Dr. Seuss).</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The <emph render='italic'>PM</emph> FBI Files consist of copies of files created and collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation between 1940 and 1950 on the activities of the newspaper and its employees.  The collection consists of photocopies of correspondence, reports, and clippings on this topic and were made in 1985 in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by an unidentified person.  The files document surveillance of the newspaper between 1940 and 1948 by the FBI and include internal and external FBI correspondence, external correspondence into the early 1950s between the FBI and American citizens regarding the newspaper and its employees, newspaper clippings, and reports written by FBI agents on this work.  Also includes a thesis written about <emph render='italic'>PM</emph> in 1984.</p>  </scopecontent>
