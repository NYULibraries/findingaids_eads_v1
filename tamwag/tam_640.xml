    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Service Employees International Union Committee of Interns and Residents is the largest housestaff union in the United States. It was founded in 1957 as the Committee of Interns and Residents to represent interns and residents in New York City hospitals. In May 1997, the Committee of Interns and Residents affiliated with the Service Employees International Union, and currently represents over on million health care workers across the United States.</p><p>In 1958, the Committee of Interns and Residents achieved the first collective bargaining agreement for housestaff anywhere in the U.S. and by the mid-1960s, it had established the only housestaff-administered benefit plan. Between 1969-70, members in the private, or voluntary, sectors began to organize and join the Committee of Interns and Residents, and in 1975 reached it a landmark achievement when it won contractual limits for on-call schedules of one night in three in New York City. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it successfully negotiated innovative maternity leave clauses, won pay for housestaff covering for absent colleagues, and in 1989 helped shape New York State's regulations that set maximum work hour limits for housestaff. In the 1999 Boston Medical Center case, Committee of Interns and Residents won a National Labor Relations Board decision guaranteeing residents in private teaching hospitals the right to join a union. </p><p>Committee of Interns and Residents members have historically played an active role in advocating for access to care for the uninsured and for important services like interpreters. The union lobbied for passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and works with teaching hospital employers to secure vital funding for safety net hospitals. The union also collaborates with teaching hospitals to better integrate residents into hospital safety and quality improvement projects to increase the value of care provided to patients.</p>  </bioghist>
