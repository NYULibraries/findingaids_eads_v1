            <p>The New-York Historical Society ephemera record group is comprised of print materials generated for public distribution by the institution between 1839 and 2012, and documents N-YHS communication, programming, outreach, and promotion over its years of operation.</p>
            <p>Materials include (in order of prominence) admission tickets; invitations; souvenir exhibition programs, checklists and small pamphlet-style catalogues; event programs, handouts, calendars and schedules; meeting and election notices; library, museum, and membership announcements; publication and other informational brochures; blank ballots, order forms, membership applications, and stationery; bookplates; form letters; posters, postcards, flyers, and other promotional items; and circulars for subscriptions to building initiatives, the Publication Fund, or other endeavors.</p>
            <p>Within the context of this record group, ephemera does not include newsletters or other periodically published bulletins, substantially sized and/or bound volumes, three-dimensional artifacts, items intended for sale, or paper materials not produced in bulk printings. Other items commonly relocated by the archivist to other record groups during processing include: press releases, press kits, clippings and other publicity materials; gift shop catalogs and products; and staff notices, memos, and other items circulated exclusively within the institution. Most notated or otherwise personalized materials have been relocated to other record groups, though a few such documents remain with the ephemera.</p>
            <p>Series I. Ephemera Files contains chronological files of N-YHS print material created and distributed between 1839 and 2012.</p>
            <p>Series II. Ephemera Scrapbooks contains materials compiled into scrapbooks over time by N-YHS staff between 1843 and 1985; the content largely overlaps with Series I.</p>

        <processinfo id="ref8">
            <head>Processing Information Note</head>
            <p>Series I materials were previously organized chronologically into two collections of "Miscellany" and "Ephemera," with documents transferred to archival containers and folders.</p>
            <p>Series II scrapbooks were originally assembled over time by N-YHS staff. In 2015, the scrapbooks were disbound by conservation intern Sara Belasco, but arranged and foldered according to their original order as found in the books. Archivist Brynn White integrated these and other relevant materials, made minor changes to the arrangement, removed select materials more relevant to other record groups, and provided description in a finding aid in 2015.</p>
            <p>As general policy, five of the best-quality copies of small-format announcements, tickets, and invitations were retained, and three copies retained of other ephemera materials. Excess duplicates are stored in restricted boxes, as noted in the container list.</p>

            <p>This finding aid relates to just one record group of the New-York Historical Society archives. For information about the other record groups and for overall information about the archives, please see the Guide to the New-York Historical Society Archives (NYHS Archives). Ephemera can be found in several of the other record groups that are processed and available to researchers, though usually with contextual information. Examples of record groups that have material especially related to the New-York Historical Society ephemera record group (NYHS-RG 14) are as follows:</p>
            <p>The New-York Historical Society general correspondence record group (NYHS-RG 2) includes various N-YHS distribution materials created between 1804 and 1979.</p>
            <p>The New-York Historical Society celebratory and memorial event record group (NYHS-RG 15) includes invitations, event programs, tickets, and other material associated with select special events hosted by N-YHS between 1854 and 1954.</p>
            <p>The New-York Historical Society press clippings (NYHS-RG 7) includes scrapbooks, some of which hold ephemera.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                    <p>This series contains chronological files of N-YHS print material created and distributed between 1839 and 2012.</p>
                    <p>Multiple copies of small-format event announcements and tickets, dating between 1871 and 1982, are stored separately in card boxes. These contain 19th- to early 20th-century monthly and annual meeting notices sent to members, often highlighting a special guest lecturer and presentation topic. Circa the 1920s, announcements and invitations for exhibition previews and concerts also start to appear. Around the mid-1940s, N-YHS incorporated film screenings into its event programming (often projecting titles from its own collection), and began hosting an increasing number of exhibition previews, private receptions, and board of trustees events. Two annual events represented throughout the files from this period forward are the Strawberry Festival, held in late spring, and St. Nicholas Day Festival, a 19th-century tradition revived in 1939 as a holiday season celebration .</p>
                    <p>Researchers interested in specific periods should also consult the folder files, where further invitations and tickets may appear, in addition to calendars, gallery floor plans, exhibition programs and checklists, and other informational, educational, and promotional items for N-YHS special events, exhibitions, public programming, development, membership, publications, and library/museum collections and services. Calendars and handouts for conferences and symposia hosted by and at N-YHS are also present. Ephemera produced for fundraising and donor events proliferates from the 1990s onward, including materials for the History Makers Gala (annual benefit held since the mid-1980s), movie premieres (
                        <emph render="italic">The Age of Innocence</emph>, 
                        <emph render="italic">The Wings of the Dove</emph>), and other society events held onsite (e.g., fashion show by the design house Halston). A small amount of 19th and early 20th century fundraising/subscription circulars and other documents for building construction, general support, Publication Fund, and acquisition of artworks is also in the series.</p>
                    <p>A diverse group of outside organizations are represented in the series, many of which held meetings and other events onsite at N-YHS, or collaborated on exhibitions or other programming. These include the Daughters of the Revolution, Columbia University, Allied Artists of America, Holland Society, Maiden Lane Historical Society, School Art League Steamship Historical Society of America, and the Long Island Preservation of Antiquities.</p>
                    <p>The end of the series features general information brochures and/or undated materials for the institution, its library and museum, and the fundraising and membership departments. Other files contain blank postcards, stationery, and bookplates.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                    <p>This series contains chronologically assembled scrapbook pages of N-YHS print material created and distributed between 1843 and 1985. A majority of the materials -- which were alternately glued, stapled, or slid into plastic sleeves -- overlap with content found in Series I, though with some variation. Due to varying degrees of paper brittleness and adhesive deterioration in many of the files, researchers are advised to consult Series I first.</p>
                    <p>Early scrapbooks are captioned by prior staff, whom also prepared indexes based on lecturer name, and inputted description of events for which they did not maintain associated ephemera. Further details and specific highlights of individual scrapbooks may be found in the container list.</p>
                    <p>External organizations represented in the ephemera scrapbooks, many of which held meetings and other events onsite, or collaborated with N-YHS on exhibitions or other programming: Modjeska Club, American Jewish Historical Society, Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences, Municipal Art Society, Railway and Locomotive Historical Society, National Sculpture Society, Netherlands Aid Society, Polish Institute of Art and Sciences, United Daughters of the Confederacy, Steamship Historical Society of America, New York Folklore Society, National Council of Jewish Women, Society of Architectural Historians, Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities, and most significantly, Allied Artists of America, who organized annual competitions for exhibitions; the School Art League, who hosted a medal and scholarship presentation; and the New York Society for General Semantics, who offered a popular seminar series at N-YHS.</p>
                    <p>The scrapbooks contain a few formats outside the record group's defined parameters for ephemera, chiefly newsletters and press releases.</p>

                    <head>Arrangement Note</head>
                    <p>The Series II materials were originally collected and compiled by a prior staff member in 10 chronological scrapbooks; the original order was maintained during and after their disassembly and foldering by a conservator in 2015. The container list transcribes the original title assigned to each scrapbook; the original cover and spine appears before each run of files attributed to the respective scrapbook.</p>
