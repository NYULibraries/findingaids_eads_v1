            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>Founded in 1978 by Stefan Eins, Fashion Moda quickly became an important voice in the art world during the late 70's to mid-80's. Defining itself as a 'concept' and its South Bronx location as 'Museum of Science, Art, Invention, Technology, and Fantasy,' Fashion Moda crossed boundaries and mixed metaphors, which helped to redefine the function of art. Featuring such artists as Keith Haring, David Wojnarowicz, Jenny Holzer, Mark Kostabi, Joe Lewis, John Ahearn, Kenny Scharf and graffiti artists like Richard Hambleton, Koor, Crash, Daze, Spank and many others, Fashion Moda was a major force in establishing new venues. Its South Bronx location allowed Fashion Moda the freedom to explore the question "What is art?" and "Who defines it?" Mostly funded by grants from the NEA, NYSCA and other, outside money, the space encouraged the production of art that was not dictated by the contemporary art market or academic art training. As such, it was a center where many downtown and local South Bronx artists, writers, and performance artists first displayed their works and workshopped their ideas. It was closely tied to the global emergence of Hip Hop. Fashion Moda closed its South Bronx location in 1993. However it continues in concept. Artforum: "Fashion Moda has been around forever."</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Fashion Moda Archive includes photographs, color slides, posters, flyers, announcements, press releases, magazine articles, reviews, grant proposals, video tapes, business files, artworks, and one audio tape. The archive was built and preserved by Stefan Eins and others at Fashion Moda. Oversized archival materials from the various series are located in three oversize boxes at the end of the archive and in the mapcase.</p>
            <p>The Fashion Moda archive is comprised of business files, nearly 400 photographs of exhibitions and artists, approximately 3,200 35mm slides documenting exhibitions and other events, newspaper articles, reviews, grant proposals, artist resumes, correspondence, video tapes of the cable TV series "Making Coincidences", production materials relating to Fashion Moda's contribution to Documenta 7 in 1982, posters, flyers, and art work by Kenny Scharf, Jenny Holzer, Keith Haring, Charles Andre, Paulette Nenner, and Wendell Headley. A portfolio of artists prints produced by Fashion Moda is included in Series IIID. It consists of works by Ronnie Curtone, Crash, Daze, Leon Golub, and James Poppitz. The scope of the archive is comprehensive in that it contains all records and files kept by Stefan Eins. As much as possible, his original organization of the material was preserved. Please note that you may need to look at more than one series - as listed below. Materials were grouped by format. Slides, press releases, flyers and other information about the same exhibition, event or artist may be in more than one series. Some cross referencing has been done, but it is not comprehensive.</p>

The files are kept in the original order as received by the Fales Library.</p>
