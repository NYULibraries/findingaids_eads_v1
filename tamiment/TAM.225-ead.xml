            <p>This small unprocessed collection contains correspondence; reports by CUNY, The New York State Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Education, as well as by interested third parties (most of these latter critical of the CUNY plan); reports produced by CUNY faculty and others CUNY activists opposed to the Plan; legal documents relating to actions taken by the Plan's opponents; research files; and a file of material pertaining to Friends of CUNY, a group in which Cooper participated.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Sandi E. Cooper, PhD, is a professor of history at the College of Staten Island of the City University of New York (CUNY). In 2000, CUNY issued "The City University of New York Master Plan 2000-2004," the controversial product of several year's work principally concerned with raising academic standards at the University. Many, including Cooper, opposed the plan, seeing it as harmful to the working class and people of color students who comprise the majority of CUNY's student body, and held that it would lessen their access to CUNY, especially to its four year colleges (as opposed to its two year community colleges) and failing to provide for them adequate academic and remedial support, in effect, undermining CUNY's policy of open admission. A notable critical report, "The Future of CUNY" (2000), was produced by the Commission on the Future of CUNY of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York.</p>
