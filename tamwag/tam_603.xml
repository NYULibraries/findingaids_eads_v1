            <p>This collection contains files collected, and in some instances created by Steve Early in his roles as a Communications Workers of America (CWA) official and as a writer on labor topics. The collection documents the struggles of the CWA in New York, New Jersey, and New England with the NYNEX telephone company and other major telecommunications employers, such as Verizon and the Southern New England Telephone Company, including contract negotiations and strikes. These materials are from New York and New England CWA locals and CWA District 1, from the 1980s until 2007. Among the materials are meeting agendas and notes, internal union memos, strike strategy memos and training materials, injunction-related legal papers, daily newsletters on strike proceedings, flyers, clippings, circulars and other printed ephemera, and several oversized posters. The collection also documents Early's work as an organizer for the CWA and success in campaigning and collaborating with other unions and social justice groups to achieve change in the union.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Steve Early was an organizer, strike strategist, labor educator, lawyer, and a national staff member of the Communications Workers of America (CWA). CWA-represented telephone workers in the Northeast participated in national, regional or statewide strikes in 1983, 1986, 1989, 1998, 2000, 2004, and 2011. During these struggles the CWA cooperated with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which also represented some telecommunications workers. As many as 60,000 workers in New York and New England were involved in the anti-concession strikes during this period at NYNEX and other major telecommunications employers. The four month NYNEX strike in 1989 defeated health care cost shifting. The CWA also struggled against employers' give-back demands, including the demand for forced overtime, and struggled to defended defined benefit pensions and retiree health coverage. The CWA also fought for card check unionization, and for employer neutrality during organizing campaigns, especially at Verizon Wireless, the company's fast-growing and almost entirely non-union cellular subsidiary.</p>
            <p>As a CWA representative in this region and telecommunications industry strike coordinator, Early was involved in local contract negotiations, helping to publicize strike issues, organize mass rallies and marches, pressure company and public officials for favorable settlements, and generate grassroots community-labor support. Early is also the author of

                    <p>This series contains materials from two different strikes; the first was a strike against Southern New England Telephone (SNET) by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), Local 1298 and the Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers (CUTW) in Hamden, Connecticut. The strike lasted 28 days in August and September of 1998. The materials related to the strike include clippings, strike bulletins, bargaining and negotiations materials, campaign flyers, meeting agendas, strike strategy and training materials, final settlement documents, injunction-related legal papers, photographs (including photographs of Vice President Al Gore at the strike), correspondence, and other materials.</p>
                    <p>The other strike in this series is related to a four day walkout that was planned by the CWA against SBC Communications in May 2004, due to a stall in negotiations. The materials include clippings, materials on a tentative contracts, healthcare materials, and some material with organizing with Jobs with Justice.</p>

                    <p>This series relates to the strike in 2000 and the later contract campaigns against Verizon (which had recently formed from a merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE) in the 2000s. In 2000, 85,000 CWA and IBEW workers on the East Coast (12 states) went on strike for three weeks in August 2000 over mandatory overtime. Other materials in the series are related to contract campaigns throughout the early 2000s against Verizon over different labor practice, layoffs, and cut benefits at local unions in the northeast. At different points, organizers like Early worked with other social justice organizations, like Jobs with Justice, to mobilize workers. The materials in this series include mobilization reports, flyers, clippings, email correspondence, posters, bargaining and negotiations materials, research reports, strike bulletins, organizing materials, and other ephemera.</p>
