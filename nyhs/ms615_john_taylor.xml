<p><emph render="bold">Historical Context:</emph></p><p>Described as a man who advocated "measures and not men... actions and not words", John W. Taylor was as much a product of his times as he was a creator of them, generating a legacy which while lacking direct recognition nevertheless permeates the American socio-political landscape in seminal and enduring ways.  His papers reflect a deep and abiding commitment to service to his country, his constituents and his personal convictions.  </p><p>Raised in an established American family with roots in Saratoga County, New York dating to 1692, Taylor distinguished himself early as a gifted student and debater.  Upon graduation from Union College at the age of 19, he founded the Ballston Academy, engaged in successful business ventures, served as the Deputy Post Master and earned his law credentials.  He married a young woman of Scottish descent, Jane Hodges, with whom he raised 5 sons and 3 daughters.  Appointed to the State Assembly in 1811, Taylor's steady independence propelled him to federal office in 1813 as a Republican Congressman.  Thus at the age of 29, Taylor joined a group of young, ambitious men including Henry Clay, Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun who wrestled with the nuances of the physical, legal, political and spiritual governance of a county only just evolving from its infancy toward its first toddling steps as an individualized political entity.   </p><p>John W. Taylor entered the national political arena during the second half of the War of 1812 in which the United States failed to extend its territory into Canada but succeeded in establishing itself as a militarily stalwart and politically autonomous country.  Thus ensconced in President James Monroe's Era of Good Feeling, purported as a time of national unity while the country strove to expand, it was James Tallmadge, Jr. and Taylor, both congressmen from New York State, who in 1819 ushered the debate of the abolitionist into the goal of western expansion.  </p><p>Championing the Restrictionist cause was an ethical imperative for Taylor who fervently promoted and authored amendments aimed at preventing and/or limiting the legally sanctioned institution of slavery into newly created states.  Using his considerable parliamentarian talents as a tactful, fluent, concise and effective orator, Taylor's response to southern Secessionists threats was resolute: "The honorable gentleman greatly mistakes the people of this country if he supposes this Union, cemented by strong interests, consecrated by glorious achievement, sanctified by the blood of heroes, and endeared by victories won by the exertion and treasure of all … can ever be destroyed or in the least impaired by promoting the cause of humanity and freedom in America".  </p><p>The results were variable often highlighting yet another seminal and enduringly contentious issue regarding the extent of the power of the Constitution as well as that of the federal government to dictate legislation upon States.  Ultimately, many of Taylor's unsuccessful but core proposals formed the bedrock of the ensuing Missouri Compromises including the establishment of a geographic boundary between slave and free states at the 36/30 parallel known as the Mason-Dixon Line. </p><p>John W. Taylor went on to serve as Speaker of the House twice, during the second half of the 16th Congress in 1821 and again for the entire 19th Congress of 1825-1827.  A statesman who advocated service to the people above service to a political party, his reluctance to be drawn into the contentious fractioning within the New York State Republican party between the Bucktails led by Martin Van Buren and the supporters of Governor DeWitt Clinton with whom Taylor was ultimately associated nearly cost him the 1821 appointment.  By 1825, the machinations required to maintain political footing on the national stage had aligned Taylor solidly with long time ally John Quincy Adams in whose 1825 election Taylor provided pivotal support.  </p><p>During the years of 1833-1842, intervening his Congressional Service and incapacitation from a paralytic stroke, Taylor returned to Saratoga County where he practiced law, served in the State Assembly and was instrumental in the development of the Whig party.  Taylor spent his waning years in Cleveland, Ohio in the care of his daughter.  He was buried upon his death at age 70 in Ballston Spa.  Despite an absence of 12 years, his memorial at the courthouse was well attended by dignitaries and citizens of every ilk and he was eulogized as a man who "was lauded when he flourished and strengthened when he fainted, as scarce ever was a man before."</p><p><emph render="bold">Historical Resources:</emph></p><p>Alexander, DeAlva Stanwood.

Subseries 1 contains correspondence received by John W. Taylor primarily through the years of 1813-1833 while he served in Congress.  The letters address a range of local, state and federal political issues including elections, political parties and abolition.  Subseries 2 consists of draft or copy forms of correspondence created by John W. Taylor.  This subseries includes over 80 letters to his wife, Jane Hodges Taylor from 1813-1833 that document a somewhat more intimate reflection on his day-to-day political life.  Also in Subseries 2 is a draft of Taylor's letter sent to and the response received from Thomas Jefferson.  While Jefferson declines knowledge of Taylor's request for information about Phi Beta Kappa, he does offer an unsolicited, somewhat cryptic but supportive in tone recognition of Taylor's political endeavors presumably with regard to his abolitionist stance. In light of Jefferson's acknowledged concern of the impact of the abolitionist movement upon the cohesiveness of the Union and his publicly neutral stance regarding the Missouri Compromises, this is an intriguing aspect of the collection.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref6_qsa" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries 1: Correspondence received by John W.
