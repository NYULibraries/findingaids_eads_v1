            <p>The Saint Andrew’s Society of the State of New York was founded in 1756 to provide charitable relief and promote social ties within the growing Scottish-American community. It followed the founding of Saint Andrew’s Societies in Charleston (1729), Philadelphia (1747), and Savannah (1750), as well as the Scots Society of New-York (1744-1753). In 1775, meetings were suspended due to the Revolutionary War. At that time the Society’s membership included both British officers and American revolutionaries. Three members—Philip Lawrence, Lewis Morris, and John Witherspoon—were signers of the Declaration of Independence. In 1784 the Society reorganized and resumed its original mission. There are few records from this early period, however, because in 1835, most documents, including the original constitution signed by the founding members, were lost in a fire.</p>
            <p>The Society’s membership was initially open only to Scottish men and their sons and grandsons. In 1897, membership was opened to men of any Scottish lineal descent. The membership of the society involved many political, commercial, and cultural leaders. During the Civil War, a number of members served in the 79th New York Volunteer Infantry, nicknamed the Highland Guard. Other prominent members include: Philip Livingston, William Livingston, Robert R. Livingston, Alexander Hamilton, John Loudon McAdam, Washington Irving, Andrew Carnegie, James Gordon Bennett, Alexander Graham Bell, John Lindsay, and Thomas J. Watson Jr.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
            <p>The Saint Andrew’s Society of the State of New York Records document several significant aspects of Scottish and American history in New York. As a social club that attracted prominent individuals to its leadership and events, and as an aid organization that served Scots in need, the Society produced records that reflect the lives of a wide variety of people within the New York area’s Scottish community.</p>
            <p>The records contain many types of material, including minutes, financial ledgers, committee records, and ephemera.</p>
            <p>The collection is arranged in the following six series:</p>
            <p>Series I: Administrative Records</p>
            <p>Series II: Charitable Records</p>
            <p>Series III: Membership Records</p>
            <p>Series IV: Event Records</p>
            <p>Series V: The Pibroch</p>
            <p>Series VI: Miscellaneous Historical Material</p>

                    <p>Charitable records document the Society's mission to provide aid to individuals of Scottish descent. Responsibility for the dispersal of aid originally fell to the Board of Managers, until 1841, when the Society hired an Almoner to investigate cases and provide aid. In addition to the primary fund, special funds were also established for specific charitable purposes, which can be seen in the President's Fund and Scholarship Fund subseries.</p>

                        <p>The President’s Fund was established in 1944 in response to the effects of World War II in Scotland. Separate from the Permanent Fund, which could only be spent in New York, it allowed the Society to supply aid to Scottish charities at the discretion of the President. Records in this subseries consist chiefly of correspondence related to individual donors and recipient organizations. There are also administrative reports on the status of the fund.</p>

                        <p>The Scholarship Fund (1955 – 1992) was established as part of the Society’s Bicentennial celebrations. For the majority of its history, it provided financial aid to Scottish students wishing to study in American universities and vice versa.</p>

                        <p>Material in this subseries was filed in two categories prior to processing. The first was a general file containing administrative correspondence, fundraising material, program information, and other records. The second contained correspondence and records related to the individual scholarship recipients. This arrangement is preserved under the headings “Committee records”, which is arranged first, and “Student files”, which follows. There is, however, some overlap between the two categories. Each set is ordered chronologically.</p>

                        <p>Member Files contain application materials and correspondence related to an individual’s involvement in the Society. All refer to inactive members. "Archived" Member Files reflect the filing system from about the 1990s to the time of accession. They therefore include the files of members active in the 1990s and 2000s. Additionally, many earlier member files, primarily although not exclusively those with last names beginning with 'A' through 'C', had been interfiled into this subseries. See also the following subseries Unarchived Member Files.</p>

                    <p>The Pibroch was the newsletter published by the Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York from 1944 to 1994. It featured reviews of meetings, member news, reports from officers, pieces of cultural and historical interest, and information related to social events.</p>
                    <p>The series is divided into two subseries. The first subseries consists of the published issues of the Pibroch. The second subseries, publication records, contains files held by the editor of the Pibroch. The Recording Secretary was typically responsible for editing the newsletter, and the files include mockups, page proofs, clippings, copyright forms, and correspondence. Material is arranged chronologically within each subseries.</p>
