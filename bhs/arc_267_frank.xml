    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>Brighton Laundry Company was a Brooklyn-based company established in the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn. Its services included dry cleaning, rug cleaning, and fur storage. In the 1940s, after 30 years of operation, the company had $2,000,000 worth of laundry facilities, 500 employees, and 75 delivery trucks. Brighton Laundry came to be recognized throughout Brooklyn by its bright red delivery trucks. As of 2011, the original Brighton Laundry building still stands and it is used as office space for various companies. The building is located at West 6th Street and Neptune Avenue.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Jerome Frank photographs of Brooklyn consist of 54 photographs documenting areas of Brooklyn during the 1980s. The collection includes both black-and-white and color photographs. Subjects include exterior views of the Brighton Laundry building located in Coney Island; views of areas near the boardwalk and Surf Avenue in Coney Island; views of the first annual Coney Island Mermaid Parade held in 1983; views of buildings and locations in Prospect Park; and views of buildings associated with the Brooklyn Academy of Music, among others. The photographs documenting areas of Coney Island might be of interest to researchers as they show buildings and structures that have since been demolished such as the jazz club "Land of Jazz" and the Thunderbolt roller coaster. All photographs were taken by Jerome Frank from 1983 to 1988 and include handwritten captions on the verso.</p>  </scopecontent>
