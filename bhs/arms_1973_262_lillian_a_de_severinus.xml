    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Originally minimally processed to the collection level, the collection was reprocessed in August 2023 to address preservation concerns. One of the scrapbooks consisted entirely of newsclippings and was on pages prepped with adhesive. The pages and the clippings were brittle and browned. These pages were photocopied and the originals discarded. The book's embossed paper cover was retained. The other scrapbook was loose pages in a paper binder. The binder was removed and discarded and the pages with newspaper clippings photocopied and the originals discarded. Ephemera was retained along with pages with photographs, which were sleeved.</p>  </processinfo>
