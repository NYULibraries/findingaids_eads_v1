The club was founded in 1937 as an educational offering of the New York City YMCA's 63rd Street branch, and the organization continues, though now independent of the YMCA.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes newsletters and administrative records of the Park West Camera Club (PWCC), and examples of the photographs taken by its members. The records are not complete, but do hold substantial runs of important documents.  The newsletters date primarily from 1984 to 2014. Minutes of meetings are primarily from 1947-1959, with some from the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some of the club's group activities are documented, most notably its 2015 exhibition <emph render="italic">Through Our Eyes</emph> and the 2017 exhibition celebrating PWCC's 80th anniversary. Original photographic prints by members comprise a significant part of the collection. These photographs range in date from the 1940s to the early 2000s.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Park West Camera Club was founded in 1937. Originally called the Hypo Hounds, the club began as an educational offering of the 63rd Street branch of the YMCA in New York City. The group changed its name to Park West Camera Club in 1952. It remained affiliated with the YMCA for several decades, until the 1990s or early 2000s. At the YMCA the group had a basement meeting space with equipment for developing photographs. This space was also used to house the organization's records and select member photography. In the 1990s, the basement space flooded, destroying many records and photographs, and damaging others. The incident spurred the creation of an Archives Committee led by Myrna Harrison-Changar, which eventually drew on the salvaged material to mount the exhibition <emph render="italic">Eight Decades of Photography</emph> in 2017 in celebration of PWCC's 80th anniversary. The exhibition was held at the Soho Gallery in Tribeca, where PWCC had taken up residence after it spun off from its YMCA affiliation. As of 2018, PWCC still meets weekly at the Gallery. </p><p>(The above note was based on information from the collection and from PWCC's <extref actuate="onRequest" href="https://www.parkwestcameraclub.org/Default.aspx">website</extref>.)</p>  </bioghist>

The first is a run of minutes of PWCC meetings, dating from 1946-1959. The second set includes the contents of binders maintained by the club's History Committee for years 1978-79 and 1979-80; these includes minutes, newsletters, member lists, competition results, and other documents for those years (see the more detailed content list at the folder level below). The third set includes minutes and newsletters from 1983-85, likely maintained by the Recording Secretary. The fourth set includes financial records (revenue, expenses) for 1978-88. The final set includes documents primarily from 2016-17 and relate to the activities of the Archive Committee then in place. </p><p>As can be seen from the above description, there are substantial gaps in coverage. There are no minutes or other administrative records for 1960-77 and from after 1985. The few newsletters in this series add some earlier years to those found in Series I (1984 and later), but there remain gaps. </p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_c60e137f2454edf0bee40748db9b63b2"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is arranged by the sets of administrative records in the collection, which advance in rough chronological order, with sizable gaps in coverage.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_1f7da2092ec012af9fb6e7df529a40e1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1946-1948</unitdate><container id="aspace_791b4f2b30d37a372c4b037ab4943b1a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_791b4f2b30d37a372c4b037ab4943b1a" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_5f155985e32e2952b4105e73edbf46ec" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1949</unitdate><container id="aspace_9281dd69b0444034b58bdd64d69ea12b" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_9281dd69b0444034b58bdd64d69ea12b" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_c4bb344fdc48704a2d60d967260692f5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1950-1951</unitdate><container id="aspace_3a40e4b930550c9377975cd7edde72fc" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_3a40e4b930550c9377975cd7edde72fc" type="Folder">11</container></did></c><c id="aspace_da6ae5e33188c48e3bdad2912fba9db3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1952-1953</unitdate><container id="aspace_a3a29d1b2afe6057f7551c8b0a5ef4a7" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_a3a29d1b2afe6057f7551c8b0a5ef4a7" type="Folder">12</container></did></c><c id="aspace_0c58aa005cd4ed9559b2da2dad10043a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1954-1955</unitdate><container id="aspace_782c9190f8f3d6d9cfb7b5f4f1e564b6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_782c9190f8f3d6d9cfb7b5f4f1e564b6" type="Folder">13</container></did></c><c id="aspace_7d72f52e8e70763bc4acc2f60f334304" level="file"><did><unittitle>Minutes</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1956-1959</unitdate><container id="aspace_f41586d5e213699e9f34e305f47a64b1" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_f41586d5e213699e9f34e305f47a64b1" type="Folder">14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_d3f46410327230b0f4466ee6b57a33a6" level="file"><did><unittitle>1978-1979 Records, from Binder (5 folders)</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1978-1979</unitdate><container id="aspace_d384d5181cf808af164cffea12b55af4" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_d384d5181cf808af164cffea12b55af4" type="Folder">15-19</container></did><acqinfo id="aspace_5d8c89e948354db5fb551fb5a2cbef9f"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>This binder was a gift from Paul Perkus.</p></acqinfo><scopecontent id="aspace_672688fae76fc68093486e0352d25bbe"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Folders hold content taken from a 3-ring binder maintained by the club's historian for 1978-79, Dan Arthur: newsletters, meeting minutes, administrative correspondence, lists of general members, committees and committee members, event attendance counts, and slide and print competition grades.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_164f5f4a8f25e243c53c090b4fc1fda7" level="file"><did><unittitle>1979-1980 Records, from Binder (5 folders)</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1979-1980</unitdate><container id="aspace_0a9cb241ecdcaf141343d5be6bb2042c" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_0a9cb241ecdcaf141343d5be6bb2042c" type="Folder">20-24</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_52057298ac9b679c5ec645818170c1c8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Folders hold content taken from a 3-ring binder, likely maintained by the chairperson of the History Committee for that year, Dan Arthur: membership and committee lists, newsletters, constitution (as adopted 1975 and amended through 1979), by-laws, meeting minutes, correspondence (including room reconstruction negotiations with the YMCA in connection with the Y's intent to have the PWCC share space with ceramics activities), YMCA photo competition &amp;

Most of these are individual prints, often mounted on backing material, ranging from the 1940s into at least the 1970s, though most are undated. The work of Harry Noah is especially well-represented in these photos. Many of the photographs and their backing are water damaged, as they were rescued from a flooded room.<lb/> <lb/>

In addition, the series includes photographs from an album maintained by the club. These photographs are by more recent members, and date from the 1990s into the 2000s. Most of these prints are black and white, though many are in color. Finally, the series includes slides by some recent members, principally Myron Brenton. Brenton's slides are of various New York City scenes, including scenes at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.<lb/> <lb/>

A digitized slide show produced by the PWCC that includes some of these images and others can be seen <extref actuate="onRequest" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqfNInglQYc&amp;t=6s">here</extref>.</scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_ca02e7504ec53d23253030eec1f54ddb"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged by format, with single photographs followed by those from the album and then slides. Within the single photographs, the arrangement is by photographer. Box 3 holds photos that are 8x11 inches or somewhat larger; flat files (FF) hold large mounted photos; and Box 4 holds photos of a size that fall between those two. Titles of work found on the print itself are noted in "quotation marks" in the container list; titles or descriptions provided by the processing archivist are noted in [brackets].</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_b553147b16f03d7bfafb09394e50446f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Apple, Bill</unittitle><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_bd9553de44782b276a39fc6fe2770141" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">4</container><container parent="aspace_bd9553de44782b276a39fc6fe2770141" type="Folder">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_130fd46e33911e09ceca1987ff53b9b9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>"Band Rehearsal"</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_59a07f866362309cd06821b08298a3f5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Arnold, M.D.</unittitle><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_3504bd3701ca05805c0f5f67ddc064bb" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">4</container><container parent="aspace_3504bd3701ca05805c0f5f67ddc064bb" type="Folder">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1241ff1fdf65d804b5c1b531f99a6e2c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>[Untitled, referred to by PWCC as "Little Girl with Bonnet."]</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7998e25b20d6beb484c5b2f25a535353" level="file"><did><unittitle>Arrington, Wally</unittitle><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_c50c91ff60a5f2522eea1fc2196faf6d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">4</container><container parent="aspace_c50c91ff60a5f2522eea1fc2196faf6d" type="Folder">6</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_39f3d960e0cfdab9670e395db4c56f79"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>"At the Top of the Stairs" [depicts a boy gazing into a rowhouse entrance].</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1c9aea619a25811b85130af7d935c42b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Arrington, Wally</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_199272b45a835f0a87c1d1ecec9ed36b" label="Mixed Materials" type="Folder">FF-1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fc98adc1f1e8fa90b47589f053968387"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>2 photographs: "Window" [2 children at apartment window] and "Little Brother" [two boys on train or waiting area?].
