            <p>Public assistance to the blind began as early as 1718 in New York State. From the beginning, efforts to help the blind was based on making them self-reliant and self-supporting. Eye diseases were much feared in New York City during the 19th century and into the early 20th century. The rise of contagious eye diseases such as conjunctivitis and trachoma occurred simultaneously with the establishment of orphanages in the city, where diseases could spread easily and quickly. During the 19th century, infirmaries and hospitals specializing in the treatment and prevention of eye disease were established throughout the city, with the earliest example being the New York Eye Infirmary (now the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary) founded in 1820. New York also led the country in educating blind children with the founding of the first school to provide formal education for blind children, The New York Institute for the Blind, established in 1832.</p>
            <p>Brooklyn was also a forerunner in providing services, education, and assistance to the blind. Homes for blind children such as the Sunshine Home Nursery, Hospital, and Kindergarten for Blind Babies, established in 1904 and located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Dyker Heights, provided education and training enabling the children to become self-reliant.</p>
            <p>The Dyker Heights Home for Blind Children, organized 1904 and incorporated in 1905, was located at 1255 84th Street (near 13th Avenue) Brooklyn, N.Y. The building was purchased in 1906. The Home's mission was to prepare the children to be independent adults through leading a healthy lifestyle, education, and training. It was a non-sectarian organization that accepted any child regardless of nationality or ethnicity. In 1910, the Dun House for Older Children, located at 1256 83rd Street, was acquired by the Home. The Dyker Heights Home for Blind Children also worked with the New York State Board of Education to provide a classroom at P.S. 127 for older children after graduating kindergarten.</p>
            <p>The Sunshine Home for Blind Babies Nursery and Kindergarten was located at 1255 84th Street.</p>
            <p>The Goodwill Industries of Brooklyn was located at 369 DeKalb Avenue.</p>

            <p>The Brooklyn charitable organizations for people with disabilities collection spans the years 1930 to 1962 and measures .21 linear feet. Materials represented in the collection include annual reports, publications, concert and event programs, and newsletters. The annual reports are of particular interest as they often contain constitutions and bylaws, financial reports and statistics, lists of officers and committee members, and reports from officers and staff. Though the collection represents organizations that provided assistance to disabled children and adults, the bulk of the collection pertains to charitable organizations for blind children.</p>
            <p>Organizations represented in the collection include: The International Sunshine Branch for the Blind (and its subsidiary homes for blind children--Dyker Heights Home for Blind Children and Sunshine Home for Blind Babies Nursery and Kindergarten); Brooklyn Day for the Blind and Handicapped, Women’s Committee; Brooklyn Week for the Blind; Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service; and Goodwill Industries of Brooklyn.</p>
            <p>The bulk of the collection consists of one annual report (1915) and annual financial reports (1916 to 1925) for The International Sunshine Branch for the Blind (later, International Sunshine Society). The annual report includes the certificate of incorporation, constitution, and bylaws; reports from officers (president, treasurer, historian, superintendent, secretary); and detailed financial information. It also goes into great detail describing of the daily lives of the children, their education and job skills training, musical training (including piano and singing lessons), dancing lessons, playtime activities, craft making, and summer holiday beach retreats in Brooklyn. Further, they include many images of the children.</p>
            <p>Additional materials in the collection include the annual report for the Dyker Heights Home for Blind Children, 1930-1931; a luncheon program for Women's Committee of the Brooklyn Day for the Blind and Handicapped, 1968; a program for the 48th annual Brooklyn Week for the Blind, held on April 3, 4, 5, 1962 at Hotel St. George; an annual report of the Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service, dated 1945-1946; a concert program for the 41st annual Brooklyn Day for the Blind, Protestant day concert, dated 1955, held at Hotel St. George; and two copies of the newsletter The Goodwill (1947 and 1948) published by Goodwill Industries of Brooklyn.</p>
