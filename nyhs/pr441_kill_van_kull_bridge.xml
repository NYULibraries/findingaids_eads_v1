    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Bayonne Bridge, referred to originally as the Kill Van Kull Bridge after the waterway it spans, reaches from Bayonne, New Jersey, across to Staten Island, New York. It is an arch bridge that carries vehicular traffic. Designed by Othmar Ammann and Cass Gilbert, construction began in 1928 and was completed in 1931. At the time, it was the world's longest arch bridge.</p><p>(The above note was derived from the Bayonne Bridge's entry on Wikipedia.)</p>  </bioghist>

<p>One photograph album depicting the 1929-1931 construction of the Bayonne Bridge, then referred to as the Kill Van Kull Bridge. The album holds 23 silver gelatin photographs. Most of the photos show the erection of the bridge's arches at various stages in 1930 and the bridge's piers; some are aerial views, most at eye level. A few photos from 1929 show the bottom of the cofferdam and later 1931 photos show the nearly completed bridge from various angles. Only a couple photos include the laborers; one depicts the workers positioning a steel panel during arch erection.</p><p>Although the photographs seem clearly to have been taken on behalf of the Port Authority, the compiler of this particular album is unknown. The album cover is embossed only with the initials R.T.R., with a title "Kill Van Kull Bridge: Staten Island Approach Piers." One photo showing the length of the bridge is attributed to photographer Eric J. Baker of Elizabeth, N.J. Three aerials are attributed to Airmap Corporation (1) and Fairchild Aerial Surveys (2). The others are unattributed.</p>  </scopecontent>
