            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Collection consists of 53 individual collections, many named for renowned naval officers or vessels. These include correspondence, letter books, journals and diaries, lectures, essays, account books, biographical writings, genealogical information, scrapbooks, orders, notes, articles and clippings, photographs, manuscripts, and ships' logs, as well as the organizational records and correspondence of the Naval History Society itself.</p>
            <p>The majority of the collections document American naval engagements and commercial maritime pursuits, personalities, and vessels; a few collections of British and French documents are included (Series 18, 22, 39, 50). The Collection as a whole provides primary sources on American naval involvement in hostilities from the Revolution (1775-1783) to the Spanish American War (1898), as well as routine commercial and naval shipboard life, naval design, navigation, education and officer training. The Society's records (Series 53) document the founding, management, and activities of a collecting and publishing organization in the first third of the 20th century.</p>
            <p>As well as documenting individual events and personalities, the Collection is a richly detailed example of late 19th and early 20th century subject-specific collecting activity and interests. Many of the collections are so-called artificial collections, with items specifically accumulated and grouped together to document a particular subject or person, and showing the personality and interests of the collector through the materials' organization and editing.</p>
            <p>The Collection reflects most strongly the personal interest of John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3), founding President of the Naval History Society in 1909 and a collector of books, manuscripts, and memorabilia connected to naval history and personalities. His son, Col. James Barnes (see Series 4), donated Barnes's collections to the Naval History Society in 1915. The library was cataloged under the XN call number and the artifacts included in the museum collections of New-York Historical Society after it absorbed the Naval History Society's collections in 1925 (see Series 53 for a complete chronology).</p>
            <p>Other materials were subsequently donated to or purchased by the Naval History Society in fulfillment of its mission of "publishing and preserving manuscripts, documents, and writings relating to our naval history, naval art and science, and the surroundings and experiences of seamen in general and of American seamen in particular." Some of the manuscript collections were edited and published by the Naval History Society for distribution to its members (see Series 53, subseries VI, for a complete list). The John Barry (Series 5), James Fenimore Cooper (Series 11), John Paul Jones (Series 28), Officers' autograph letters signed (Series 44), and Miscellaneous Manuscripts (Series 52) collections document the emphasis on autograph and highpoint collecting typical of his time, which were particular interests of John Sanford Barnes.</p>
            <p>The collections vary in size and complexity, from one volume to an individual's lifetime of personal and family papers. Although amassed separately, because of their shared focus the constituent collections are interrelated in illuminating ways: Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox (Series 17) is strongly represented in 
                <title render="italic">Monitor</title> designer John Ericsson's (Series 16) correspondence received (and vice versa), while the USS 
                <title render="italic">Dictator</title> (Series 13) collection provides a photograph of an ironclad of the Monitor class; Charles Biddle's (Series 6) early documentation of Panama prefigures the extensive and routine ocean traffic of the Gold Rush period (Series 43); Theodore P. Greene (Series 24) commanded a vessel on which Richard Worsam Meade 3rd (Series 31) served; the collections containing material on Isaac Hull and William Bainbridge (Series 1, Series 27, Series 52) provide complementary documentation of the naval engagements of the War of 1812; while the commercial logbooks in both Series 43 and 51 document some of the same routes.</p>
            <p>Although focused on naval history, the Collection is by no means exhaustive or complete. Barnes's personal interest; collections put on the market by individuals, dealers, and auction houses; and changing levels of interest in collections of both notable individuals and those lesser known all contributed to the availability of materials and their eventual inclusion in (or absence from) the Collection.</p>

            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>The collection is arranged into 53 series in the alphabetical order of the Naval History Society's individual named collections, followed by three series of logbooks, a Miscellaneous Manuscripts collection, and the Society's records series.</p>
            <p>In some cases the inclusion of materials in a series seems fairly arbitrary. For example, John Sanford Barnes's materials on John Barry and John Paul Jones appear both in those named series (Series 5, Series 28) and in the appropriate folders of the Miscellaneous Manuscripts collection (Series 52). The final series is the records of the Society itself, documenting all of its routine activities including the editing and publishing of some of the manuscript collections; it is organized into seven subseries.</p>
            <p>The Barnes family materials have been organized into three individual series: General James Barnes, John Sanford Barnes, Colonel James Barnes (Series 2-4). The logbooks have also been organized into three separate series: US Navy, British Navy, and commercial vessels (Series 49-51). Larger collections of mixed papers and published materials, including those of Gustavus Vasa Fox (Series 17) and Caspar Goodrich (Series 21), have been organized into subseries. Original order within folders has been retained; some materials are now housed in separate oversized (OS) boxes, noted in the container lists.</p>
            <p>The series are:</p>

                    <p>The collection consists of a manuscript and notebook detailing the outfitting of a 44-gun frigate, including required sails, furniture, medicines, and other supplies; and manuscripts of two biographies of Bainbridge. James Fenimore Cooper's biography was printed in his "Lives of distinguished American naval officers" in 1846, and in 
                        <title render="italic">Graham's Magazine</title>, in November, 1892. The Dearborn manuscript was the basis for James Barnes's edited version, "The life of William Bainbridge, esq. of the United States Navy, by H. A. S. Dearborn, 1816," published by Princeton University Press in 1931, and distributed to members of the Naval History Society in 1932.</p>
                    <p>The Cooper manuscript is available on microfilm.</p>

                    <p>Born in 1774, Bainbridge commanded ships in the West Indies, capturing French privateers, and against the Barbary Powers in the Mediterranean. While commanding the 44-gun frigate 
                        <title render="italic">Philadelphia</title>, the ship foundered and he was captured and imprisoned in Tripoli for 19 months. After his release in 1805, Bainbridge made various naval and merchant marine voyages to India and Russia, returning to the United States as hostilities increased with England. As commander of 
                        <title render="italic">Constitution</title>, he captured the British frigate 
                        <title render="italic">Java</title> on December 29, 1812, during which engagement he was wounded twice. He subsequently had various commands and shore assignments and served as Naval Commissioner from 1824-1827 and from 1829-1831. His command of the Charlestown Navy Yard was curtailed by illness in November, 1832. He died in Philadelphia in 1833 and is buried in Christ Church there.</p>
                    <p>John Sanford Barnes was Bainbridge's grandson-in-law: his wife, Susan Bainbridge Hayes, was the daughter of Commodore Bainbridge's daughter, Sarah Bainbridge Hayes.</p>

                    <p>James Barnes was born in Boston in 1809. After graduating from West Point in 1829, with classmates including Robert E. Lee and Joseph E. Johnson, he taught infantry tactics there and then served in the military garrison in Charleston Harbor. At the outbreak of the Civil War he raised the 18th Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers and was appointed Colonel, later serving at the battles of Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, where he commanded a division and was wounded. He then was in command of the Union prisoner of war camp at Point Lookout, Maryland (see Series 37), for the remainder of the War. His last public service positions were as a commissioner of the Pacific Railroad and Superintendent of the Western Massachusetts Railroad. He died in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1869.</p>

                    <p>The collection includes Barnes' journals as a midshipman and later in his naval career, manuscripts on naval engagements, tactics, prizes for salvage operations during the Civil War blockades, correspondence and clippings, condolence notes to his widow, a family genealogy he prepared, organizational membership certificates and Army and Navy commissions issued to him and other family members, his handwritten list of the latter documents, and two scrapbooks documenting naval and family-related topics. The genealogy includes mention of a Sanford relative, Henrietta Emmerson, who was the owner of Dred Scott, the decision in whose case determined that African-Americans were not citizens and which negated the Missouri Compromise. Because Emmerson was a minor at the time, Scott's suit in 1857 was brought against her uncle, John Francis Alexander Sanford.</p>
                    <p>The 1908 printed Foreword to a collection of Barnes's letters to his wife includes details of his life and naval service; the letter collection is not included in the series.</p>
                    <p>Barnes's father General James Barnes's commissions are signed by Presidents Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson, and Abraham Lincoln; his own by Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan; his father-in-law Thomas Hayes's by William Henry Harrison; and his uncle Henry Bainbridge's by James Monroe, James Polk, Andrew Jackson, and Millard Fillmore. His autobiography is handwritten and was privately produced; it is inscribed from Mrs. John Sanford Barnes to the Barnes's daughter Charlotte Adams Barnes (Mrs. Edward Shelton Martin), who presented it to the New-York Historical Society in 1961.</p>

                    <p>The son of General James Barnes (see Series 2), John S. Barnes was born at West Point, NY, in 1836. He entered the Naval Academy at Annapolis at age 14, serving after his graduation on 
                        <title render="italic">Preble</title>, and under Commodore Stewart on 
                        <title render="italic">San Jacinto</title> in Europe and the West Indies, and on 
                        <title render="italic">Saratoga</title>. He was aboard 
                        <title render="italic">Arctic</title> when it participated in the first survey for the original Atlantic cable in 1856. The following year, aged 21, he was appointed assistant professor of ethics at the Naval Academy, and after a subsequent year in private business he was appointed master of 
                        <title render="italic">Jamestown</title>. In 1858 he resigned his commission and attended law school in Albany, New York, practicing until 1861. During the Civil War, he served initially as navigator of 
                        <title render="italic">Wabash</title>, and later as commander of 
                        <title render="italic">Dawn</title>, 
                        <title render="italic">Paul Jones</title>,

                        <title render="italic">Bat</title>. In 1863 he married Susan Bainbridge Hayes, granddaughter of Commodore William Bainbridge (see Series 1) and great-grandniece of Admiral John Barry (see Series 5). After the War, he served as commander of the Naval Academy's practice ships 
                        <title render="italic">Marblehead</title> and 
                        <title render="italic">Savannah</title>, as an instructor at the Academy, and wrote "Submarine Warfare": the first major work on the use of torpedoes.</p>
                    <p>From 1869 to 1880 he was in private business and began devoting time to collecting memorabilia of the Navy during the Revolution and War of 1812. He served as the first President of the Naval History Society and edited the first volume of its publications, "The Log Books of the 
                        <title render="italic">Serapis</title>, 
                        <title render="italic">Alliance</title>, and 
                        <title render="italic">Ariel</title>," before his death in 1911. His manuscript collections and library formed the basis of the Naval History Society's collections, and were donated to the Society in 1915, by his son Col. James Barnes (see Series 4).</p>

                    <p>The son of John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3), James Barnes (1866-1936) graduated from Princeton in 1891 and served in the Naval Reserve during the Spanish-American War. He was an editor for 
                        <title render="italic">Scribner's Magazine</title>, 
                        <title render="italic"> Harper's</title>, 
                        <title render="italic"> Book Lovers Magazine</title>, and on the staff of "The Photographic History of the Civil War," first published in 1910. At the outbreak of the Boer War he traveled to Africa as a newspaper correspondent, and early in 1914 conducted a photographic expedition there for the American Museum of Natural History. In 1917 he organized and headed the Princeton Aviation School and served in the aviation section of the Signal Officers Reserve Corps. He oversaw aerial photographic work at the front during the American involvement in World War I, returning to head the US School of Aerial Photography in Rochester, NY. The author of over 20 books of historical fiction, adventure, naval biography and history, he published his autobiography "From Then Till Now" in 1934, during his retirement in Princeton, NJ.</p>
                    <p>Barnes donated his father's collection of naval materials to the Naval History Society in 1915. He served as the Society's President from 1918 until his death, and on its Board of Managers. In 1931 he edited "The life of William Bainbridge, esq. of the United States navy," by H. A. S. Dearborn, 1816, based on manuscript materials in the collection (see Series 1), which was published by Princeton University Press and distributed to members of the Naval History Society in 1932.</p>

Between 1826 and 1829, it protected American shipping near Brazil while that country and Argentina battled over possession of what is now Uruguay. Later it was deployed in the Mediterranean, the West Indies, Brazil, and reached Macao in 1842. After subsequent sojourns in Asia and Mexico, it was wrecked off the Bahamas in 1846 with no loss of life.</p>

                    <p>British troops under the command of Sir Henry Clinton mounted attacks on Fort Sullivan (close to the later site of Fort Sumter) in Charleston harbor by both land and sea in June, 1776, believing its defenses to be incomplete. Britain's plan had been to subdue rebel forces in the southern colonies and muster more support from Tories after their previous defeat at Bunker Hill and continued challenges in the northern colonies. The attacks on Fort Sullivan were repulsed, however, culminating in the withdrawal of British troops and Clinton's return to New York City. The British did not launch subsequent assaults in the south until 1778, returning to Charleston only in May, 1780.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of James Fenimore Cooper's "The history of the Navy of the United States," originally published in two volumes in 1839, extra-illustrated by John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3) into an eight-volume version with the addition of 427 portraits, 343 prints, 154 autograph letters signed, 32 maps, 23 broadsides, 10 signed documents, and 11 original water color sketches and portraits. It is accompanied by original and carbon typescripts of Barnes's lists of the extra illustrations, a manuscript notebook index of the additions, and a folder of photoreproductions.</p>
                    <p>Among the autographed letters included are those of John Barry (see Series 5), Cooper himself, John Hancock, Commodore Bainbridge (Series 1), Isaac Hull (Series 27), David Porter, and Commodore Perry (Series 36), all of whom are represented elsewhere in the Naval History Society Collection. The illustrations document all the major naval battles, ships, and persons mentioned in Cooper's work.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Historical Note</emph></p>
                    <p>The practice of adding printed, manuscript, and visual materials as well as associated ephemera to previously published volumes probably began with James Granger's 1769 publication of "Biographical History of England," in which leaves were left blank specifically for the insertion of portraits by the purchaser. So-called extra-illustration reached its peak in the late 19th century as an organizational and collecting paradigm. An extra-illustrated volume very much reflects the collector and his or her interests, serving as a repository in the form of a cabinet of curiosities in which to display a wide range of associated, however remote, materials. Contemporary descriptions of extra-illustrated volumes often stress the volume of materials added as well as their quality, a significant expansion of the original being a virtue. Cooper's "History" provides a perfect setting for the physical manifestation of Barnes's lifelong interest in naval history and memorabilia, citing as it does every major naval engagement and personality. This work, when considered together with the Miscellaneous Manuscripts (Series 52), US Navy: Officer's autograph letters (Series 44), and John Paul Jones collections (Series 28), provides material evidence of Barnes's passion for collecting and its meticulous documentation.</p>

It lists the added materials, by page number, throughout the eight volumes and is indexed alphabetically by volume.</p>

                        <title render="italic"> Columbia</title> in the Mediterranean and coastal Brazil, and aboard various ships in the Gulf of Mexico during the Mexican War (1846-1848). In 1848 he attended the Naval School at Annapolis, but was dismissed from the Navy in 1848 for having engaged in a duel. In 1849 he began three years of service in the Navy of the German Confederation, including as first officer of the imperial steam corvette

                    <p>Vessels in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron were responsible for preventing Confederate ships from supplying ships in Virginia and North Carolina, and for supporting Union troops. Those in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron operated between Cape Henry, North Carolina, and Key West, Florida.</p>

                    <p>The collection includes original correspondence to and copies from John Ericsson (the latter predominantly in the hand of his secretary, Samuel W. Taylor, and a few autograph) as well as telegrams, invoices, receipts, writings, clippings, articles, an account book, and a volume listing his articles on torpedo warfare. The materials were a gift in 1912 to the Naval History Society from Ericsson's biographer William Conant Church, and the correspondence is annotated and underlined throughout in various colors, perhaps by him as part of his research for "The Life of John Ericsson" (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1890). Undated materials appear to have been from Church's research and papers, and include separated and unidentified documents. The materials are mostly in English, with some in Swedish and German. Portions of this collection relating to the Civil War have been digitized and are available to on-site researchers and to users affiliated with subscribing institutions via

                    <p>The collection documents many aspects of Ericsson's engineering interests and projects: the building and testing of ironclad warships to his specifications for the United States (USS 
                        <title render="italic"> Monitor</title>, 1862) and other governments (Peru: May 1862; Greece: January 1869; Spain: May 1869; China: October 1880, spring 1883); the costs of construction through his extensive contact with Delamater and other ironworks and foundries as well as negotiations with Congress (1864-1865); applications and renewals of patents (1830s, 1840s, December 1864, July 1866); experiments with solar energy (1868, July 1872); design and testing of torpedo warships, including detailed expenses for 
                        <title render="italic"> Destroyer </title>(January 1873, September 1874, April 1875, 1878-1882, January 1889) and reports on its trials (October 1883); as well as various complete lists of ironclads built to Ericsson's specifications (May 1866, December 1867, July 1877).</p>
                    <p>Highlights of the collection include copies of Ericsson's January 20, 1862, letter to Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox (see Series 17), proposing the name 
                        <title render="italic">Monitor</title> for his ironclad vessel; and his January 30, 1873, letter to President Ulysses S. Grant explaining that the torpedo systems currently in use are inadequate for the country's defense.</p>

                    <p>Born in Sweden in 1803, Ericsson emigrated first to England (1826) and then to the United States (1839). Having shown early promise as an engineer, and holding numerous patents for steam-powered engines, he designed the first screw-driven steamship to cross the Atlantic (
                        <title render="italic">Robert F. Stockton</title>, 1839) and the first propeller-driven steam warship for the US Navy (USS 
                        <title render="italic"> Princeton</title>, 1842). In 1861 he contracted with the Navy to build in 100 days an ironclad warship, 
                        <title render="italic"> Monitor</title>, which successfully fought the Confederate ironclad 
                        <title render="italic"> Virginia</title> (originally 
                        <title render="italic"> Merrimack</title>) at Hampton Roads on March 9, 1862, before sinking off Cape Hatteras later that year. After the Civil War, he pursued his interests in torpedo-armed vessels, and in a variety of scientific and engineering subjects, including solar energy. He died in New York in 1889 and was interred in Sweden in 1890.</p>

                    <p>Gustavus Vasa Fox (1821-1883) read law with his future wife's uncle, Isaac O. Barnes, in 1837 and began his maritime career as a midshipman in 1838. He served in various naval and mercantile vessels before retiring in 1856 to manage the Bay State Woolen Mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts. His suggestions for the relief of Fort Sumter were not followed, but through connections to Abraham Lincoln via Postmaster Montgomery Blair (his wife's brother-in-law) he was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Gideon Welles in 1861. He served in that position through the Civil War, functioning as de facto chief of naval operations. He championed the cause of ironclad fighting ships, supporting John Ericsson (see Series 16) in his bid to build 
                        <title render="italic">Monitor</title>. Fox is credited with improving the management of the Navy that made possible its wartime victories.</p>
                    <p>In 1866 he made the first transatlantic voyage in an ironclad (
                        <title render="italic">Miantonomoh</title>) to deliver a congressional resolution to Tsar Alexander II, congratulating him on his escape from an assassination attempt. The ship made extensive stops in European ports en route. In 1867 he made an unsuccessful attempt to take over the Southwest Pacific railroad, the forerunner of the St. Louis-San Francisco railroad. In 1869 he began management of Middlesex Mills in Lowell, Massachusetts, moving to Boston in 1874 from where he commuted to Lawrence to manage Washington Mills for the commission house of Mudge, Sawyer, and Co. He retired in 1878 and pursued interests that included documenting Columbus's first landfall in the new world, and the local history and topography of New Hampshire.</p>

                        <p>The materials up to 1862 document Fox's interests and activities including his plans for the reinforcement of Fort Sumter, and the value of steam battleships culminating in his support of Ericsson's design and construction of 
                            <title render="italic">Monitor</title>, as well as its battle with

                            <title render="italic">Merrimack</title>) at Hampton Roads in 1862. These papers appear to have been collected after the fact and include correspondence from John Ericsson and the draft of an unnamed publication on the subject. They are annotated by Virginia Woodbury Fox and document requests she received for information on the subject.</p>
                        <p>Papers dating after the Civil War document Fox's 1866 mission to the court of Tsar Alexander II, his attempt to purchase the Southwest Pacific Railroad, his 1883 publication "The first landfall of Columbus: Is there extant evidence enough to prove the first landing place of Columbus in the new world?", and his interest in the history and topology of New Hampshire. The draft of his Columbus article is in a secretary's hand and edited in pencil, probably by Fox, and also shows Virginia Woodbury Fox's annotations. Some of the notes are numbered in pencil in order from 1 to 204, with no explanation provided for these notations.</p>

                        <p>The subseries includes an autograph collection, souvenirs of social and cultural events, calling cards received at home while the Foxes lived in Washington, drawings, photographs, and the illustrated manuscript of a satirical account of life aboard a steam battleship. The autographed letters include some addressed to President Andrew Jackson and then referred to the Secretary of the Navy, and show signatures of author Washington Irving, President Martin Van Buren, and politicians Robert Livingston and Thurlow Weed. The invitations include those to Lincoln's second inauguration in March, 1865; dinners with visiting Russian officers; and a ceremony marking the raising of the American flag over Fort Sumter after its recapture in 1865. Among the undated cards announcing an "at home" is one for the White House from President and Mrs. Lincoln.</p>
                        <p>The drawings include some by Admiral David Porter, who is probably the author and illustrator of the satirical volume. The photographs include one of a woman, perhaps Virginia Woodbury Fox, alone, and with members of her family; as well as an unidentified older African-American woman.</p>

                        <p>The subseries includes publications and other printed information as well as newspaper clippings on the Woodbury family, and on Fox's areas of interest and related to his writings. Some of the commercial printed materials appear to have been collected randomly. The scrapbook pages are leaves from other books onto which clippings have been glued. The document on "small Vessels in which I have been concerned" is anonymous but appears to be written by Robert Bennett Forbes, based on the ships listed. One document is in Chinese and may be the guest list for an event Fox attended.</p>

                        <p>The materials are arranged chronologically. The bundled clippings were originally stored separately; some of the other subject-related clippings were originally in other series and have been gathered together here. Some of the clippings were grouped by subject and others by time period; their original arrangement has been retained.</p>

                        <p>The subseries includes letters sent (both originals and drafts) and received by Virginia Woodbury Fox, with recipients including her husband and other family members, as well as officials of St. John's Church in Washington, DC. After her husband's death, she donated land on which the Church erected an orphanage, with a plaque commemorating Gustavus Vasa Fox. Notes in her hand indicate that she destroyed much of her correspondence to her husband. Among those letters saved, and specifically marked, is that of July 20, 1863, describing the Draft Riots in New York City. Other highlights include a note (c. 1862) from Mary Lincoln and a separated envelope from President Abraham Lincoln.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>Virginia Lafayette Woodbury (1821-1908) was the daughter of Levi and Elizabeth Clapp Woodbury. She married Gustavus Vasa Fox in 1855; they had no children. Her sister, Mary Elizabeth, married Montgomery Blair and their children included Montgomery Blair, who was the Foxes' heir.</p>
                        <p>
                            <emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p>
                        <p>Some of Virginia Woodbury Fox's letters to her husband are filed with his letters received in Subseries I. Correspondence. Others are included here with her family's papers: she appears to have retrieved them from her husband's papers and specifically organized them here herself.</p>

                        <p>The subseries includes correspondence and personal papers of members of the Woodbury and Fox family, including Virginia Woodbury Fox's father Levi and uncle Isaac O. Barnes. Levi Woodbury's letters received include those signed by Presidents Andrew Jackson (1835) and James Buchanan (1847) and by Senator Thomas Hart Benton (1851). The letters received are originals; the letters sent are letterpress copies, some of which are difficult to read. Most of the Barnes letters were in alphabetical order, which has been retained; the 1850-1851 letters were originally in the Levi Woodbury correspondence and have been moved here with their original order retained.</p>

                        <p>Levi Woodbury (1789-1851) served as Secretary of the Navy (1831-1834), Secretary of the Treasury (1834-1841), United States senator (1841-1845), and Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (1845-1851). The bulk of his and other Woodbury family papers are now in the Library of Congress. Levi Woodbury's sister Hannah (b. 1800) was married to Isaac O. Barnes (b. 1798). Gustavus Vasa Fox served as executor of Barnes's will. The materials give no indication of William Bowes Bradford's relation to the Woodbury family; G.W.M. Guild appears to have been a nephew of Fox's.</p>

                        <p>Some correspondence in Subseries I was originally folded and then bundled in stacks between wooden boards, probably for storage in pigeonholes within a desk or cabinet. On the boards was written the content and date range of the stacked documents. A few were retained with the collection and are included here. This subseries also includes Virginia Woodbury Fox's notes regarding decisions she made about her husband's papers.</p>

                        <p>The bound volumes include Fox's letters (many to his future wife's uncle and aunt, Isaac O. and Hannah Woodbury Barnes) and journals from cruises on various vessels, a scrapbook about him collected by Virginia Woodbury Fox, a scrapbook of clippings created by a Blair or Fox family member, household accounts and records of the Foxes' stock and property holdings, two letter books (one containing letter press and one carbon copies), a writing portfolio that was a gift from Levi Woodbury, a relief map of New Hampshire's White Mountains, and the edited editions of Fox's correspondence published by the Naval History Society.</p>
                        <p>Virginia Woodbury Fox's notes in Volume 1 indicate that she erased or deleted various sections that she deemed to be "too personal." Her note in her scrapbook documents its importance to her and to any future biographer of her husband.</p>

                    <p>The collection consists of two volumes of transcripts from the Archives Nationales of France documenting the role of vessels under the command of Admiral De Grasse in the Battle of Yorktown.</p>

                    <p>French ships of the fleet of Admiral Francois Joseph Paul, Comte De Grasse (1722-1788), drove off the 19 British ships of Admiral Graves in early September, 1781, in the so-called Second Battle of the Virginia Capes. This isolated the forces of Cornwallis at Yorktown, contributing to his eventual surrender.</p>
                    <p>According to the Society's 1914 Annual Report, the location of De Grasse's records was unknown for many years. "But by diligent search, undertaken on the order of the Minister of Marine, upon the solicitation of the Secretary of the Society..., the lost records were found - the logbooks of all of De Grasse's ships, the dispatches received from the Admiral and the letter-book of orders issued to him from Paris." These were transcribed for the Society by the French government and were included in the seventh volume of its publications: "The Despatches of Thomas Graves, R.N., 1781," edited by Rear Admiral French E. Chadwick, U.S.N. and printed by DeVinne Press, New York, in 1916.</p>

                        <title render="italic"> General Grant</title> was built in 1863 at Monongahela, PA, and chartered in July, 1864. It was assigned to patrol the upper Tennessee River, where it helped to clear Confederate troops from the area. In October, 1864, it destroyed 22 boats off Port Deposit and Crow Island, Maryland. On November 25 of that year, it took up the pontoon bridges previously constructed by Union troops in Decatur, Alabama.</p>

                        <p>The subseries consists mainly of official correspondence received, including orders to report to ships, permissions for leave, administration of the Torpedo Board, service on various courts martial, and assignments to lecture at the Naval War College. The letters sent are mostly typescript carbons with some letterpress copies, and include official reports filed on operations and cruises, providing details of the responsibilities of a ship's commander in this period. John Meigs's January 1909 letters discuss the formation of a naval historical society and in that year John Sanford Barnes sends draft bylaws of the Naval Historical Society, comparing it to Britain's Naval Records Society. The last document was found in the original Correspondence box and is not in Goodrich's handwriting; it may have been written by New-York Historical Society librarian Dorothy Barck.</p>

                        <p>The subseries includes notes, handwritten drafts, and final versions (mostly carbon typescripts) of lectures Goodrich presented at the Naval War College, as well as notes on other topics. Also included are a newspaper clipping and a list of personal items, perhaps from the Goodrich residence, found with the lecture materials. "The Problem of 96" is one of the annual examinations by College cadets of a challenge in coastal defense: the 1896 one looked at a specific part of nearby Narragansett Bay. This is an early precursor of the theoretical "war games" the College famously initiated.</p>
                        <p>The numbered lectures were delivered in order as part of a series on famous international naval encounters, from the Battle of Sluys in 1340 to Drake's destruction of King Phillip's fleet in Cadiz Harbor in 1587, Napoleon's Nile Campaign of 1798, and the 1827 Battle of Navarino during the Greek War of Independence. These form the backdrop for Goodrich's final multipart lecture on Dewey's engagement in Manila during the Spanish-American War, which had occurred only three years before these lectures. It is unclear if the material on the Army's landing in Cuba formed part of this presentation.</p>

                            <emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p>
                        <p>The lecture notes are arranged chronologically and the numbered lectures in order as noted on them and their original packaging. Some lectures' accompanying graphic materials (maps and photoreproductions probably used in the preparation of lantern slides) were pinned to the lecture text; these have been separated, numbered by page on which they appeared, and housed by lecture. The notes' original envelopes are in separate folders; they may date any time from the lectures in 1901 to the collection's donation to the Naval History Society in 1933.</p>

                        <p>The subseries includes notes and final versions of Goodrich's writings, apart from the lectures he delivered at the Naval War College, including various topics in naval warfare, an address on establishing a naval training facility in San Diego, and his 1924 memoirs. The latter includes a typescript with handwritten emendations probably by James Barnes, who edited the work for publication by the Naval History Society ("Rope yarns from the old navy," published by J.J. Little &amp; Ives Co., as the eleventh volume of the Society's publications), and a final clean version incorporating those changes. The memoirs are an affectionate look at his early service in the Navy, which he describes as "coincident with the great changes from sail to steam; from wooden frigates to steel dreadnoughts; from smooth bore muzzle loaders to breech loading rifled cannon; from man power to electricity."</p>

                    <p>Samuel Dana Greene (1840-1884) served as USS

                        <title render="italic"> Merrimack</title>) on March 9, 1862. Although criticized for permitting 
                        <title render="italic"> Merrimack</title>'s retreat, he acted in accord with the orders of both President Lincoln and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus V. Fox (Series 17), confining 
                        <title render="italic"> Monitor</title> to a defensive role. Between 1866 and 1884 he served in various capacities at the US Naval Academy. From 1868 to 1871 he saw service with the Pacific Squadron aboard USS

                        <title render="italic"> Despatch</title> from 1882 to 1884. He killed himself at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, attributed to anxiety over an article on the

                    <p>The United States battle fleet's first ever global circumnavigation, involving some 14,000 sailors and stops in 20 international ports, departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, on December 16, 1907. The 16 battleships and escorts (nicknamed "The Great White Fleet") made stops in Trinidad and Cuba before sailing along South America's east coast, through the Straits of Magellan, and north up the west coast to rendezvous in Magdalena Bay, Mexico. The fleet arrived in San Francisco in May. From there it called at Honolulu, Hawaii; Auckland, New Zealand; Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth, Australia; Manila; Tokyo and Yokohama, Japan; Amoy, China; Hong Kong; and reached Suez, Egypt, on January 3, 1909. In Italy, crew members offered aid to victims of a recent earthquake there. The fleet departed Italy January 9, 1909, making a stop in Gibraltar and arriving at Hampton Roads on February 22.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Content</head>
                    <p>The series includes five 18th century documents from the collection of John Sanford Barnes (Series 3) related to the exploits of John Paul Jones; and supporting material about Jones either produced or collected by both Barnes and his son Col. James Barnes (Series 4). The series documents Jones himself, the history of the Barnes's collecting of Jones-related information and objects, and their efforts to determine the authenticity and veracity of these. It includes John Sanford Barnes's correspondence with various Jones biographers and collectors, typed transcripts of Jones's ships' logbooks and personal correspondence, photoreproductions of original items in Barnes's and other collections, clippings and other published materials, Col. James Barnes's writings on Jones, and undated and unattributed notes about the provenance and acquisition of Jones-related material.</p>
                    <p>The original documents carry the signatures of Jones himself on a letter to DeNeufville introducing John Barry and, on his commission aboard 
                        <title render="italic"> Providence</title>, that of John Hancock. The clippings document a report of the finding of Jones's body in Paris in 1903, the 1909 appearance of 
                        <title render="italic"> Ranger</title>'s logbooks and a separate auction of Jones material, information from the Russian archives in 1926, and the Naval History Society's participation in placement of a new headstone at the grave of Jones's brother William Jones in Fredericksburg, VA, in 1930. It is not clear who added the 1976 clipping on the purported finding of the wreck of 
                        <title render="italic"> Bon Homme Richard</title>.</p>
                    <p>The correspondence documents organizations and individuals interested in Jones material, including the Library of Congress (the Manuscripts Division published "A calendar of John Paul Jones manuscripts in the Library of Congress" in 1903); biographer Anna deKoven (author of the 1913 "The letters of John Paul Jones"); and Grenville Kane, the Naval History Society's treasurer who was acknowledged as the greatest collector of Jones material. There is both a clean and an edited version of the typed transcript of Jones's correspondence, which Col. James Barnes may have planned to publish.</p>
                    <p>Some of the photocopied material shows penciled notes on the original items' provenance and history. The Beaumont Groube material documents John Sanford Barnes's effort to determine, through a handwriting comparison, the writer of 
                        <title render="italic"> Serapis</title>'s logbook (see Series 49). Photocopies of Jones's sealing wax imprint on the DeNeufville letter fueled continuing speculation about whether the seal itself had originally been a gift to him from Marie Antoinette.</p>
                    <p>The commission signed by Hancock, Jones's letter to DeNeufville, and correspondence to and from Barnes about Jones are available on microfilm.</p>

                    <p>John Paul Jones is among the most romantic and written-about figures in Revolutionary history. His raising of the first American flag aboard a naval vessel in 1776, his response to the British call to surrender 
                        <title render="italic"> Bon Homme Richard</title> of "I have not yet begun to fight," and his victory aboard that vessel over 
                        <title render="italic"> Serapis</title> in 1779 are elements of American nation-building with almost mythic significance. John Sanford Barnes's Jones collection was a product of his general interest in naval history (with a focus on heroic exploits) magnified by his often-mentioned family connection with Jones's contemporaries Commodore Bainbridge (see Series 1) and Admiral Barry (see Series 5): Barnes's wife's grandfather James Hayes was a nephew of and adopted by John Barry; his wife's mother was Bainbridge's daughter, Sarah Bainbridge Hayes.</p>
                    <p>The early 20th century saw the publication of many biographies and articles about Jones's personal life and exploits. Their prevalence is perhaps attributable to the general increased focus on naval contributions to military victories after the Spanish American War in 1898 and efforts to build a "new American navy" for the new century. In 1900 August Buell published the widely quoted and later disparaged "Paul Jones: Founder of the American Navy"; in 1905 James Barnes's own "The personal appearance of John Paul Jones" was published in Appleton's 
                        <title render="italic">Booklover's Magazine</title>. The Naval History Society's first publication was "Logs of the 
                        <title render="italic"> Serapis</title>, 
                        <title render="italic"> Alliance</title>, and 
                        <title render="italic"> Ariel</title> under the Command of John Paul Jones, 1778-1780," edited by John Sanford Barnes, and printed by De Vinne Press, New York, in 1911, based on the original and transcribed logbooks (see Series 49) in his personal collection. Anna deKoven's biography (for which she consulted Barnes and his collection) was published in 1913, and in 1917 Don Seitz published "Paul Jones: His exploits in English seas during 1778 to 1780." Each added new information and raised further questions about details of Jones's life and genealogy, accomplishments, death, and burial, which were discussed both privately in correspondence among authors and collectors, and publicly in newspaper letters columns.</p>

                        <title render="italic"> Powhatan</title> during its visit to Japan under Commodore Matthew Perry; orders and telegrams received; as well as letterpress copies of official correspondence sent, most while McCauley commanded USS 
                        <title render="italic"> Lackawanna</title> as part of the Asiatic Squadron. The correspondence discusses personnel issues, local problems likely to affect American interests, and relations with Europeans and Americans in ports including Nagasaki and Yokohama, Japan; Shanghai, China; and Hong Kong.</p>
                    <p>The correspondence received had been disbound from a scrapbook and numbered chronologically in red china marker, probably preparatory to microfilming.</p>
                    <p>The correspondence and the letterpress book (Volume 3) are available on microfilm.</p>

                    <p>Edward Yorke McCauley (1827-1894), born in Tripoli while his father served there as US Consul, had an illustrious naval career: serving on various vessels on the African coast in the 1850s, as part of the coastal blockade during the Civil War, and rising through the ranks of commander (1866), fleet captain and chief of staff of the North Atlantic Squadron (1867), captain (1872) while serving in the Pacific, commodore (1881), and rear admiral (1885). In 1881 he was elected fellow of the American Philosophical Society, and was the author of works on Egyptology including a dictionary of hieroglyphics published by the Society.</p>
                    <p>As a midshipman in 1852 he was aboard USS 
                        <title render="italic"> Powhatan</title>, the flagship of Admiral Matthew Perry, when it departed Norfolk for Japan and entered Tokyo Bay on February 14, 1854. Perry oversaw signing of the first treaty with Japan on March 31, opening that country to commercial contact with the West.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Content</head>
                    <p>The collection is comprised of materials related to the crew of brig 
                        <title render="italic"> Washington</title> and prize claims for capture of 
                        <title render="italic">Amistad</title>; correspondence and records from Meade's command of various vessels and at the New York Navy Yard; detailed information about 
                        <title render="italic">San Jacinto</title> under his command, including the salvage of its equipment after it was wrecked; materials related to the inquiry into John McLaughlin's conduct during the Florida campaign against the Seminole Indians; Meade's efforts to make Spanish translations of notable American documents available after the Mexican-American War; a statement from his estate; and a newspaper clipping about the reconstructed 
                        <title render="italic">Amistad</title>'s participation in Operation Sail.</p>
                    <p>One of the lists of officers aboard 
                        <title render="italic">Washington</title> during its capture of 
                        <title render="italic">Amistad</title> and the prize money apportioned is dated April 23, 1800: this appears to be an error in transcription from an original.</p>
                    <p>Meade's role in the expedition to map Colombia's Atrato River is not clear from the correspondence: its mission was to map possible transisthmian sites before Panama was eventually chosen.</p>
                    <p>The foldered log books of 
                        <title render="italic">North Carolina</title> appear to have been disbound from a volume similar to others in the collection. General orders have been pasted over the logbook entries in some places.</p>
                    <p>The Spanish translations of various documents of American freedom, and correspondence documenting efforts to have them distributed to new Spanish-speaking citizens, are undated. They may date to soon after the annexation of Texas and other Spanish-speaking territories as a result of the Mexican-American War that ended in 1848.</p>
                    <p>Much of the early correspondence bears the date, added in pencil, of the collection's acquisition by the Naval History Society: May 3, 1934. The subject of a few documents has been written on them in blue pencil.</p>
                    <p>All the volumes show the bookplate of Richard Worsam Meade (a heraldic crest bearing the motto "Toujours prest") as well as a sticker with the Naval History Society's seal that reads "From the Library of Richard Worsam Meade 4th (1870-1833), son of Richard Worsam Meade (3rd), Rear Admiral U.S.N., presented by Mrs. Richard Worsam Meade (4th), May 3, 1934".</p>

                    <p>The collection is comprised of Admiral Meade's journals kept as a midshipman, including notes and sketches; teaching-related documents from his stint at the US Naval Academy; official correspondence received; letter books and orders from his service aboard various vessels (bound in 1939 by the Naval History Society); clippings and printed materials, including those documenting efforts to erect a commemorative statue to John Paul Jones in Washington, DC; drafts and final versions of his writings on John Paul Jones; other materials related to his administrative duties at the New York and Washington Navy Yards; eight volumes of diaries bound by the Naval History Society; and clippings and ephemera postdating his death that were probably collected by his wife.</p>
                    <p>The correspondence includes that related to his 1870 negotiation of trading treaties with Tutuila-Samoa, and details of the 1883 outfitting of USS 
                        <title render="italic"> Pinta</title> in preparation for its duty off Alaska. The 1891 copy of "Northwestern Architect" includes a description of the Navy Department's exhibition planned for the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago on page 63. The letterpress copies of 1894-1895 had been disbound from a letterpress book. The John Paul Jones material includes Admiral Meade's lecture presentation to the United Service Club in 1896 and information on his daughter Annie Paulding Meade's presentation on the subject in 1899. The scrapbook materials were found with miscellaneous papers of the Naval History Society and removed to this series.</p>
                    <p>Many of the materials bear a sticker with the Naval History Society's seal that reads "From the Library of Richard Worsam Meade 4th (1870-1833), son of Richard Worsam Meade (3rd), Rear Admiral U.S.N., presented by Mrs. Richard Worsam Meade (4th), May 3, 1934". Subsequent contributions to the collection are documented through 1937.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of one volume: journal entries form the bulk of its contents. The first nine pages were originally held together separately with metal fasteners and contain navigational calculations dated 1861. On many of the journal entry pages, the ink has soaked through to the reverse side, making the writing illegible in places. Inserted in the volume was an undated typed transcript of the entries from January 16, 1864, to April 3, 1865, titled "Mullan D.W., Ens., USN, Private Journal of: NY Hist Soc MSS Collection."

                    <p>Mobile Bay, a center of Confederate blockade-running during the Civil War, was protected on land by formidable fortifications and was heavily mined in the water (with so-called naval torpedoes). On August 5, 1864, Admiral David Farragut purportedly issued the order there "Damn the torpedoes! Full steam ahead!" USS 
                        <title render="italic">Monongahela</title> was among the 18 Union vessels under Farragut's command as part of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron, which bombarded Confederate forts and then rammed CSS 
                        <title render="italic"> Tennessee</title>. Combined heavy gunfire from the other Union ships forced 
                        <title render="italic">Tennessee</title> to surrender, ending the battle and closing the last major Gulf port to Confederate access.</p>

                    <p>The collection consists of a single hand-lettered volume of mathematical algorithms for navigation and astronomical tables, including a chart with a rotating paper dial known as a volvelle for calculating "full sea" and one for calculating dominical letters (an aid to determining Sundays in any particular year, and especially the date of Easter) from 1705 to 1735. The latter is colored with a paint that has patinated to green. No author or date of production is evident for the volume as a whole. One entry dated 1721 mentions orientation using Philadelphia landmarks including Joseph Redman's wharf, Society Hill, and the Delaware River. The volume is written from both sets of covers, each bearing the bookplate of John Sanford Barnes. At one end is also a bookplate that reads "C.C. Elwes" and bears a heraldic emblem of five arrows encircled by a snake. On that end leaf are also written the names "Sam'l Howell" and "John Thom."</p>

                    <p>The series consists of an album of 48 color ink drawings by a Confederate prisoner of war at the Union prison camp at Point Lookout, Maryland, which was bound in 1880. Also included are a photograph of the camp's commanding officers (including General James Barnes; see Series 2) and the administration of the oath of allegiance to prisoners on June 30, 1865; printed orders to prison guards over Barnes's signature about the treatment of prisoners; a letter from a prisoner to President Lincoln asking to be released; and a map of the camp.</p>
                    <p>The drawings, which are numbered out of sequence in pencil, show details of prisoners' daily lives: playing cards, bartering with food vendors, and interacting with their African-American prison guards. Also included is a note by Barnes's son, John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3) indicating that the artist's name was not known. Another later note (after 1957) names the artist as Jacob Omenhausser, who was identified in the article "Omenhausser's Confederate Prisoners of War Sketch" by Harold R. Manakee in 
                        <title render="italic">Maryland Historical Magazine</title> (June, 1958, p. 177-179 and cover) and on the cover of that publication in June, 1959.</p>

                    <p>The camp for Confederate prisoners at Point Lookout (at the tip of the peninsula where the Potomac River joins Chesapeake Bay) operated from August, 1863, to June, 1865. With an intended capacity of 10,000, it housed as many as 20,000 detainees at one time; an estimated total of 50,000 military and civilian prisoners were held there. Prisoners were housed 16 to a tent in conditions of habitually short rations and an exposed physical setting that subjected them to extremes of temperature and weather.</p>

                    <p>The Rhode Island cities on Narragansett Bay, including Providence and Newport, have a long history of the building and outfitting of naval and commercial shipping. The District of Bristol was established in 1801 and included the towns of Bristol, Warren, and Barrington. Bristol was the sole point of entry for the district and the collector resided there. In 1822 the district's name was changed to the District of Bristol and Warren, which remained unchanged until 1913, when one district was established for the entire state and the Bristol-Warren designation was abolished.</p>

                    <p>The overwhelming majority of materials in the Naval History Society Collection pertain to American naval and maritime ships, personalities, and events. Because of Rodney's role as Admiral of British forces in the West Indies during the Revolution, however, his materials were of profound interest to the Society. These volumes were purchased with monies in the Naval History Society Fund, administered by the New-York Historical Society after it subsumed the Naval History Society in 1925, and added to the Naval History Society's collections.</p>

It was eventually donated to the Smithsonian Institution, which exhibited it until the 1930s when it was determined not to be authentic and removed from view.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of letter books (both transcribed and letterpress copies) of Marshall O. Roberts, New York agent for the US Mail Steam Ship Company; logs of ships on voyages between New York and Panama via New Orleans and Havana, and from Panama to California; a checkbook; a provision list; and both blank and completed tickets and contracts for passage aboard various ships on US Mail Steam Ship Company and other companies' vessels on these routes.</p>
                    <p>Robert's 1848-1849 and 1848-1850 letter books (Volumes 1 and 2) are indexed by recipients. Some of the logbooks document various commanding officers and multiple journeys back and forth along the same maritime routes between New York and San Francisco. They include details of weather, winds, other vessels passed, and crew actions, but do not otherwise document shipboard life. The provisions list is a preprinted listing of possible foodstuffs and other supplies needed for voyages, with blanks to be filled in with the name of vessel, estimate of passengers and number of days of travel, and the amount of each supply. The checkbook consists predominantly of blank checks; a few have been drawn. The foldered receipts and tickets appear to have been removed from ledger volumes of the same type as the SS

                        <emph render="bold">Historical Note</emph></p>
                    <p>Complete transcontinental railroad travel became possible in 1869 and direct shipping from the Atlantic to the Pacific in 1914 with the completion of the Panama Canal. Before then, travel between New York and the West coast required sailing to the Atlantic coast of Panama (usually with stops en route in New Orleans, Havana, and sometimes Jamaica), transit across the isthmus, followed by the Pacific journey to San Francisco. The Atlantic harbor in Panama was Chagras until 1855, when it was moved to Aspinwall (founded in 1850 and named for railway builder William Aspinwall; renamed Colon in 1890).</p>
                    <p>Marshall O. Roberts in 1847 had purchased the contract to provide mail steamships to the US government. He would realize enormous profits from the shipping demands of the California Gold Rush and the Civil War. The US Mail Steam Ship Company operated on the Atlantic coast of the United States, and William H. Aspinwall's Pacific Mail Steamship Company on the Pacific. Transit across the isthmus was by mule, wagon, or foot until 1851 when the Vanderbilt Line opened a route through Nicaragua. In 1855 the isthmus railroad connection was inaugurated.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of a one-volume hand-written index of all the autograph letters signed (ALS) owned by John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3), with details about many of them and his additional annotations in red. Some of the letters are included in his extra-illustrated edition of James Fenimore Cooper's "History of the Navy of the United States" (see Series 11), some in the Miscellaneous Manuscripts of the Naval History Society Collection (see Series 52), and others in various extra-illustrated volumes from the Naval History Society's library now cataloged in the XN classification at New-York Historical Society.</p>
                    <p>An undated note in Barnes' hand on the inside cover reads: "The numbers to this record refer to the files in Wooden case. More marked B are bound in Naval History, or in many extra-illustrated books. Many of the last named are not recorded and the "List" is imperfect. The ALS of officers of the Civil War are mainly to be found in the bound volume containing their own account of their services furnished Hamersly for his list of officers - [see Series 25] which I have not had time to detach and file. The list is very incomplete and the quotations from the letters are random paragraphs. It has been my purpose to make a better list, more systematically arranged with more frequent and fuller quotations - but I have had to abandon the project." Barnes's unfulfilled objective appears to have been a complete and annotated catalog of the letters.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of the logbook of Flag Lt. Commander William Knox Wheeler aboard USS 
                        <title render="italic">Colorado</title> during an expedition to Korea from May 19 to June 25, 1871; contemporary newspaper clippings about the expedition; a one-page document in Chinese; and later materials related to use of the logbook as a primary historical source, including articles based on it.</p>
                    <p>The logbook turns over to a scrapbook kept by Wheeler's mother, Mrs. T.H. Wheeler of Delhi, New York, of clippings documenting Lt. Wheeler's correspondence from USS 
                        <title render="italic">Plymouth</title> published in his hometown newspaper (1860); the rescue of survivors from USS 
                        <title render="italic">Iroquois</title> (1864); Wheeler's assignment to torpedo duty and subsequent court-martial for refusal to perform manual labor (1873); his death from Bright's disease while at sea aboard steamer
                        <title render="italic"> Alaska</title>; his burial in Libreville, Africa, and his subsequent disinterment, transportation to the United States, and reburial in Delhi (1876).</p>
                    <p>The 20th century materials include articles written about the 1871 expedition and information on acquisition of the logbook. There is 1975 correspondence between Robert L. Robinson, associate professor of history at University of Texas at Houston, and New-York Historical Society librarian James Gregory regarding Robinson's article (which is also included) "Gunboat Diplomacy, 1871: An American Officer in Korea," submitted for publication in 
                        <title render="italic">Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute</title>. An undated photocopy of pages from "Americans in eastern Asia: A critical study of the United States' policy in the Far East in the 19th century," published in 1922 by Tyler Dennett was clipped to William M. Leary's article, "Our Other War in Korea," published in the 
                        <title render="italic">Proceedings</title> in 1968. There is also 1975 information from Roger Butterfield, Inc. Antiquarian Booksellers, offering the original diary for sale. Gregory's letter to Robinson indicates that the logbook had been recently acquired at the time of his writing.</p>

                    <p>USS 
                        <title render="italic">Colorado</title>, as flagship for Rear Admiral J. Rodgers' squadron, carried the US Minister to China on a diplomatic mission to Korea in April, 1871, attempting to open Korea to contact as Perry had earlier done in Japan (cf. Series 29). Attacks from shore batteries on two ships of the squadron as it made soundings in the Han River led American forces to begin a punitive expedition. It destroyed the forts and inflicted heavy casualties on the Koreans, with minimal loss of American lives.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of Winslow's letters to his wife Katherine A. Winslow before and after

                        <title render="italic">Alabama</title>, copies of orders received, letters received by Winslow from various dignitaries after the victory and some sent to Mrs. Winslow after her husband's death, and a 20th century newspaper clipping describing the discovery of

                    <p>Some letters to Mrs. Winslow have been redacted in another hand and/or have had portions excised; some appear to have been previously mounted or stored in an album. A few of the earlier letters to her are fragments and have penciled on them the date "April 25, 1962". One letter (December 13, 1861) is from the Winslows' son Chilton relating his father's injuries and includes a penciled note from his father.</p>

                    <p>John Ancrum Winslow (1811-1873) was appointed midshipman in 1827, served in the Mexican War, and was commissioned commander in 1855. During the Civil War, he first served on the upper Mississippi River. Promoted to captain in 1862, he commanded 
                        <title render="italic">Kearsarge</title> (1863-1864) in pursuit of Confederate cruisers in Europe. On June 19, 1864, in a celebrated naval engagement, 
                        <title render="italic">Kearsarge</title> sank the Confederate raider 
                        <title render="italic">Alabama</title> off Cherbourg, France, where it sank. For his victory Winslow was promoted to commodore and received the thanks of Congress. He later commanded the Gulf Squadron (1866-67), was made rear admiral (1870), and commanded the Pacific Squadron (1870-72).</p>

                    <p>The series consists of private and unofficial correspondence received by Henry Augustus Wise during his tenure as head of the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, manuscripts of books he wrote under the pseudonym Harry Gringo, and correspondence related to the publication of his "Captain Brand" by 
                        <title render="italic">Harper's Weekly</title>. The letters provide details of the ordering, manufacturing and testing of ordnance, as well as everyday personal introductions and invitations. His correspondents include Percival Drayton, commander of the ironclad 
                        <title render="italic">Passaic</title> and Superintendent of Ordnance at the New York Navy Yard; R. Aulick, Assistant Chief, Bureau of Ordnance; Commander R.B. Hitchcock; Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox (see Series 17); 
                        <title render="italic">Monitor</title> designer John Ericsson (see Series 16); Admiral David Porter, whose 1862 correspondence includes humorous sketches of anthropomorphic armaments; public official Hamilton Fish; and Theodore P. Greene (see Series 24).</p>
                    <p>Comments penciled on letters in letter book 10 imply that their publication was planned: "Drayton letters, almost without exception, are well worth printing"; and "Those relating to Navy agents and [. . .] (for example) are very pertinent. They should appear". There is no indication within the series that they were published.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Biographical Note</emph></p>
                    <p>Henry Augustus Wise (1819-1869) entered the Navy as a midshipman in 1834. During the Mexican War (1846-1848) he saw action in the Gulf of California, and then became an expert on gunnery. When the Civil War began, Wise had to decide between staying in the US Navy and serving his home state of Virginia for the Confederacy. He retained his commission, and among his first duties was the burning of Gosport Navy Yard (Norfolk, VA). After a few months on blockade duty he was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography, the agency responsible for the Navy's armaments and the shore stations where they were produced and tested. He became acting chief in 1863 and was appointed chief in 1864, which position he held until illness necessitated his resignation in 1868. He died in Naples, Italy, the next year.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p>
                    <p>The letters were previously disbound from letter books and numbered for indexing in approximate chronological order. However, there are often numbers missing within a documented range. The folders are arranged in letter book order and the letters within them in order as numbered, which is not always strictly chronological.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of original and transcribed log books from US naval vessels, including those under the command of John Paul Jones (see Series 28) and Isaac Hull (see Series 27) (USS 
                        <title render="italic">Constitution</title>) and from lesser-known ships on routine cruises.</p>
                    <p>The 
                        <title render="italic">Serapis</title> logbook is notable for the variety of uses the volume was put to on the vessel under both British command and after its capture by Jones aboard 
                        <title render="italic">Bon Homme Richard</title>. It includes lists of officers and men aboard 
                        <title render="italic">Ariel</title> under the command of Jones, and deserters from 
                        <title render="italic">Bon Homme Richard</title>; was kept on board 
                        <title render="italic">Serapis</title> from September 26, 1779, to October 14, 1780; and aboard 
                        <title render="italic">Queen of France</title> in August and September of 1782. It ends with material transcribed at an unspecified date from Jones's papers on deposit at the Library of Congress as of January 18, 1872.</p>
                    <p>The 1824 USS 
                        <title render="italic">Ontario</title> cruise was via the West Indies to the Mediterranean, where it joined Commodore William Bainbridge's (see Series 1) squadron and protected commercial shipping along the Barbary Coast from pirates. The volume includes drawings and writing at the end, probably by the child or children of Murray Mason, Fairfax County, Virginia. A midshipman at the time of this log, he may have been on 
                        <title render="italic">Ontario</title> and returned home with the book.</p>
                    <p>USS 
                        <title render="italic"> Potomac</title> departed New York in August, 1831, on its first overseas cruise to join the Pacific Station via the Cape of Good Hope. On February 6, 1832, it shelled Quallah Batoo, Sumatra, in retaliation for the February, 1831, capture of merchant vessel 
                        <title render="italic">Friendship</title> and the murder of her crew. The logbook was kept by midshipman James L. Parker. In the volume are two newspaper clippings: "View of the Castle of San Juan d'Ulua with the burning of the Mexican brig Creole by Lieutenant James Lawrence Parker and passed midshipmen Hynson and Rodgers USN" (undated) and from "The Daily chronicle and General Advertiser" of August 7, 1847, a memoriam from Commodore Matthew C. Perry on Parker's July 12, 1847, death from disease brought on by wounds sustained in an attack on Tuspan, Mexico.</p>

                        <title render="italic">Grampus</title> logbooks are bound on continuous sheets that appear to have been removed from a previously sewn volume. The title page of each shows a hand-rendered drawing of the ship at full sail.</p>
                    <p>The 1844 
                        <title render="italic">Constitution</title> logbook documents a cruise to the African coast off Madagascar. It includes hand-drawn maps of the area showing the ship's route and one with soundings documented; appendices on "Madagascar," "Hints on the Economy of a Man of War" (noting health and cleanliness issues on a long cruise to an unhealthy place), "The comparative merits of hemp and chain cables…valuable extract from a report transmitted by the Board of Admiralty by Captain W.F. Owen Royal Navy," "Chronological abstract of the cruise," "Barometrical observations in the Mozambique Channel during the months of October and November 1844," "Wooden Anchors," and "The Mozambique channel".</p>
                    <p>The 
                        <title render="italic">Penguin</title> logbook documents routine shipboard operations during travel between Key West, Charlotte Harbor, and Apalachicola, Florida, before ending at Baltimore, Maryland, as part of the ship's protection of Union naval forces during the Civil War.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of 13 volumes of original and transcribed logbooks from British naval vessels. Except for the 
                        <title render="italic">Duke of Cumberland</title>, 
                        <title render="italic">Defiance</title>, and Patuxent River documents (Volumes 1, 2, 12), the logbooks appear to have been cut from previously sewn or bound volumes before being rehoused as unbound sheets in buckram boxes. Many are missing up to 1 inch of what would have been their left-hand margins and some include duplicate chronological sections.</p>
                    <p>
                        <title render="italic">Duke of Cumberland</title> was a privately owned New York vessel licensed to the British navy (a so-called privateer) to capture and confiscate French merchant ships during the 7 Years' War (1756-1763). The log documents two West Indian cruises including the capture of 
                        <title render="italic">Dolphin</title>, 
                        <title render="italic"> Eagle</title>, and 
                        <title render="italic">Grand Joseph</title> in February, 1759.</p>
                    <p>The Patuxent River logs are transcripts from the records of HMS 
                        <title render="italic">Tonnant</title>, HMS 
                        <title render="italic">Loire</title>, HMS

                        <title render="italic">London</title> transcripts document involvement in the Battle of the Chesapeake, in which the former was the flagship of Samuel Hood and the latter of Hood's superior, Sir Thomas Graves. The battle was lost to the French under the command of Admiral de Grasse (see Series 18), which had a significant effect on the outcome of the American war.</p>
                    <p>The remaining logs document routine cruises, including HMS 
                        <title render="italic">Poictiers</title> in British waters and the West Indies; 
                        <title render="italic">Beagle</title> while sailing for the Bay of Biscay to join the Duke of Wellington's forces against Napoleon; and 
                        <title render="italic">Cressy</title> off the north coast of Europe, in English waters, and the West Indies.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Content</head>
                    <p>The series consists of 20 volumes of logbooks from six sail or steam commercial vessels on routine cruises, and 15 cod-fishing vessels from York, Maine, on their annual journeys to the Bay of Fundy and St. Lawrence River fishing grounds.</p>
                    <p>
                        <title render="italic">America</title>'s 1799-1800 logbook was probably kept by Michael Hayes (nephew of John Barry, and relative of John Sanford Barnes's wife; see Series 3, Series 5) on a voyage from Philadelphia to China via Lisbon.</p>
                    <p>
                        <title render="italic">Mary</title> also sailed the China route, from Philadelphia to Canton via Batavia under Christian Christianson, master, between May 14, 1832 and April 4, 1833. 
                        <title render="italic">Camilla</title>, under James T. Watkins, master, made port in Rio de Janeiro, Cowes (Isle of Wight), and Antwerp before ending its cruise in Tarragona, Spain, from October 6, 1834 to March 1, 1835. The volume concludes with various non-voyage-related writings: "The Marriage Vow" on wifely fidelity, as well as detailed descriptions of female anatomy and various gynecological disorders. It turns over to an "Inventory of my Effects" dated Philadelphia, 1832, which lists debts incurred and monies due, as well as merchandise, stocks, and money held; a penciled draft of a letter to a loved one; and several poems.</p>
                    <p>SS 
                        <title render="italic">Republic</title> cruised from New York to San Francisco via Rio, and 
                        <title render="italic">America</title> in 1863 from New York to Panama.</p>
                    <p>The 
                        <title render="italic">Governor Clinton</title> log was a gift of Caspar Goodrich's daughter, Mrs. C.T. Davis, on the same date with other materials now collected in Series 21. This typed, corrected transcript documents a voyage from Peru to New York on which Caspar Goodrich's grandfather James W. Goodrich sailed under Captain L.B. Griswold, who was accused of drunkenness and other misbehaviors.</p>
                    <p>The fishing ships' logbooks are preprinted volumes that include regulations for the registration of vessels and their catches, and are filled in by hand to document the voyages, conditions, and amount of fish caught.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Content</head>
                    <p>The series consists of more than 1100 letters, clippings, reprints, and other documents amassed by John Sanford Barnes and others to, from, and about notable persons including many with named series in this collection (e.g., William Bainbridge [Series 1], John Barry [Series 5], French E. Chadwick [Series 8], Gustavus Conyngham [Series 10], Gustavus Vasa Fox [Series 17], Caspar F. Goodrich [Series 21], Isaac Hull [Series 27], John Paul Jones [Series 28], Richard Worsam Meade 3rd [Series 31], Oliver Hazard Perry [Series 36], Henry A. Wise [Series 48]).</p>
                    <p>The organization of the materials into this series is somewhat arbitrary. In some cases a document was removed from a named collection and specifically located here (see Henry A. Wise letter removed from letter book). In other cases there was not sufficient material on a particular person to warrant creation of a series. Individual signatures have, in some instances, been cut from their original document for inclusion here, and a name does not necessarily signify an autograph document: the Jefferson material consists of a letter addressed to him. Some folders function more as subject files than manuscript collections: they may include information collected about a person rather than correspondence to or from them.</p>
                    <p>Some of the letters are addressed to Captain Barnes; others show evidence of having been purchased by him or donated to the Naval History Society. Many are addressed to Captain Garrett J. Pendergrast, commander of the Philadelphia Navy Yard. No explanation is given for their inclusion here in such profusion. Some documents have been mounted for display and/or sale; on a few the purchase price is marked in pencil.</p>
                    <p>This series functions in parallel and complementary to the previous 51 series in the collection. Together with Barnes's List of officers' autograph letters signed (Series 44) and his documentation of extra-illustrations for Cooper's "History of the Navy of the United States" (Series 11), it further documents his, and the Society's, collection and organization of autograph materials.</p>
                    <p>The extensive Bainbridge materials in this series provide additional evidence of the Barnes family's interest in, and collecting activities related to, their illustrious forebear. Information organized here on the location and history of documents complements that in Dearborn's extra-illustrated life of Bainbridge (Series 1). The John Paul Jones material (foldered here under John Sanford Barnes) could as well have been part of Series 28, since it includes additional correspondence of Barnes with Jones's biographer Anna deKoven, and about Robert Dale and the donation of a sword purportedly owned by him and now in the collection of New-York Historical Society.</p>
                    <p>Highlights of the series include documents signed by Presidents John Quincy Adams (Bainbridge folder 5, Barry folder 1) and James Madison; others signed by John C. Calhoun, Salmon P. Chase, Richard Henry Dana, David Farragut, Robert Fulton, John Hancock, Rufus King, Seth Low, Robert Morris, and Matthew C. Perry; and a lock of Abraham Lincoln's hair removed after his death and sent by Robert Todd Lincoln to Gustavus Vasa Fox (removed from Series 17) at the latter's request.</p>
                    <p>Caspar Goodrich's 1907 letter of thanks for Barnes' sympathies at the death of Goodrich's son includes mention of the young man's portrait as a boy painted by John Singer Sargeant. Among David Porter's letters are cartoons and drawings by him, including one of animal-headed naval officers listening to explanations of the value of steam-powered vessels, which complement others in the Fox collection (Series 17). The William Smith folder includes a map of an attack on Whampoa, China, in 1870. It is unclear what Barnes's connection was to Nikola Tesla: letters from him indicate that he had visited Barnes in New York in 1904. The William C. Whitney document appears to be a personal financial report related to stock holdings but has been retained here.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Historical Note</emph></p>
                    <p>Miscellaneous manuscripts collections are artificial gatherings of single or small groups of letters, often including individual letters signed by notable persons. As such, they can be troves of autograph or highpoint materials, a specialty of later 19th and early 20th century correspondence collectors. They document that era of collecting tastes and do not reflect modern archival precepts of original order or the maintenance of a document's physical or historical context or provenance.</p>
                    <p>
                        <emph render="bold">Arrangement</emph></p>
                    <p>The series is arranged alphabetically by the subject's name, with Miscellaneous collections placed at the end of a letter's run. It includes an index organized by 200 "portfolio" numbers, probably referring to the collection's original alphabetical order. This provides detailed descriptions of individual documents, which can be matched to the current alphabetical arrangement.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of the Naval History Society's organizational and financial records (including account books, checks, and receipts). They document the establishment and administration of the Society from its foundation until it ceased independent operations: its formation, officers and bylaws, membership, finances, library and manuscript collecting activities, and its editing and publication of volumes based on materials in its manuscript collections. It shows the context of naval and maritime collecting by the Society through its officers' correspondence with members and other collectors, authors, historical societies and repositories, and the Office of Naval Records, Washington, DC; as well as the organization's internal governance and workings.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Historical Note</emph></p>
                    <p>According to the 1915 catalog of the library of Naval History Society founder John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3), "The Naval History Society has been established for the purpose of publishing and preserving manuscripts, documents, and writings relating to our naval history, naval art and science, and the surroundings and experiences of seamen in general and of American seamen in particular."</p>
                    <p>The Naval History Society Collection began with the donation to the Society in 1915 of Barnes's personal collections by his son, Col. James Barnes (see Series 4). The donation included library materials now cataloged in the XN classification in the New-York Historical Society Library, artifacts now included in the New-York Historical Society's museum collections, as well as the manuscript materials described in Series 1-52 of this Collection. The entire collection was donated to the New-York Historical Society, where the Naval History Society collections and office were then located, in 1925. Additional materials were donated by Naval History Society members and others or acquired by purchase after that date, some from the Naval History Fund established at the New-York Historical Society from the Naval History Society's monies.</p>
                    <p>A chronology of the Society's publishing activities is provided in Subseries VI. Manuscript collections and Society publication records.</p>

                    <p>1909: Meeting convenes at the New York Yacht Club to discuss formation of a naval history society. Attendees include Admiral Caspar Goodrich (see Series 21), William Conant Church (biographer of John Ericsson [Series 16]), Col. James Barnes (see Series 4), and Franklin D. Roosevelt, who serves as the meeting's secretary. John Sanford Barnes is unanimously elected president and Robert Neeser secretary-treasurer. A committee is authorized to inquire if the New-York Historical Society would serve as the Naval History Society's home.</p>
                    <p>1911: John Sanford Barnes dies.</p>
                    <p>1912: Naval History Society incorporated. Its offices are located at 247 Fifth Avenue, although some early meetings are held in Washington, DC.</p>
                    <p>1915: James Barnes donates the collections of his father John Sanford Barnes to the Naval History Society in June. They include original manuscripts, letters, and logbooks as well as published books, pamphlets, and prints (approximately 3,570 volumes and separate items). The Society rents space in Aeolian Hall on West 42nd Street to house the collection.</p>
                    <p>1915: Secretary Robert Neeser corresponds with New-York Historical Society President John Abeel Weekes in May to ask if the Historical Society is interested in acquiring the Naval History Society collections and providing a room where it can be preserved for research and exhibition. Naval History Society, "being primarily a publication society...has...no habitat or place where these priceless and unique books could be preserved."</p>
                    <p>1915: New-York Historical Society Executive Committee responds to Neeser's request: "Owing to the crowded condition of the present building, the Captain Barnes collection was respectfully declined as a deposit."</p>
                    <p>1915: The John S. Barnes Memorial Library is transferred to the Naval History Society in September.</p>
                    <p>1916: John S. Barnes Memorial Library of the Naval History Society opens January 10 in Aeolian Hall. Marie Bayless serves as librarian.</p>
                    <p>1916: The Society holds an exhibition of the Library's books, prints, and manuscripts of John Paul Jones [see Series 28] in April, and in May of its Gustavus Conyngham memorabilia [see Series 10).</p>
                    <p>1917: The Society holds an exhibition of its Revolutionary War books, prints, and manuscripts in March, and in April on the War of 1812.</p>
                    <p>1918: Col. James Barnes elected President, a position he holds until his death in 1936.</p>
                    <p>1920: Alice M. Kyte becomes librarian.</p>
                    <p>1923: Franklin D. Roosevelt is deputized by the Building Committee to contact New-York Historical Society about collaborating on space and collections.</p>
                    <p>1925: Naval History Society relocates to New-York Historical Society, which was expanding its storage and exhibition spaces, and its members automatically become Associate members of New-York Historical Society. The $15,000 Naval History Fund is also transferred, to be used to purchase additional materials for the collection.</p>
                    <p>1930: Naval History Society participates in the restoration of gravestone for William Paul (brother of John Paul Jones; see Series 28), in St. George's Churchyard, Fredericksburg, VA.</p>
                    <p>1932: Naval History Society materials are represented in New-York Historical Society's "Ships and Steamboats" exhibition.</p>
                    <p>1936: Collection of dues and publication activities are suspended following the death of Col. James Barnes and insufficient Naval History Fund monies to purchase additional materials.</p>

                        <p>The Society's correspondence includes incoming and carbon copies of outgoing letters, primarily to and from Secretary Robert Neeser and librarians Alice Kyte (Naval History Society) and Dorothy Barck (New-York Historical Society). Also represented are Col. James Barnes when he was active as President of the Society, Treasurer Grenville Kane, and attorney Herbert Satterlee. The correspondence documents all aspects of the Society's functions, including membership dues notices, publication of Naval History Society editions by The DeVinne Press and others, cataloging of Naval History Society publications by the Library of Congress, payment for or receipt of publications by members, research requests, and payment and other banking transactions. Contact with the New-York Historical Society begins in 1915 with formation of a Building Committee and discussion of a possible move of the collections from rented space in Aeolian Hall to the Historical Society's location, culminating in the move in 1925. Among that correspondence is a letter signed by Franklin Roosevelt. A November, 1936, letter to the membership announces the end of the publication program due to insufficient monies in the Naval History Fund.</p>

                        <p>Most of the correspondence was originally bundled in multiple envelopes for each year, usually organized alphabetically by last name of correspondent. Exceptions included envelopes for 1909, which were arranged chronologically in one envelope; 1917, which began as an alphabetical run but sometimes included correspondence dating to 1923; 1920, which was bundled together with 1924; and various years for which there was only one envelope containing all correspondence, especially later in the Society's history. Some large runs of correspondence to one recipient or on a particular subject were labeled as such and stored together. Those divisions have been retained, but folders have been arranged in chronological order.</p>

                        <p>The membership records include lists of members in various categories (individual, life, honorary, resigned, died), signed cards noting acceptance or decline of membership, members' war service records, records of dues payments, and proxies for meetings; as well as newspaper clippings of members' obituaries. The mailing list for a proposed Marine Museum of the City of New York was probably used as a source of addresses for potential Naval History Society members. Also included is a guest book of signatures, perhaps kept at annual meetings. Additional information on membership can also be found in some of the Annual Reports (Subseries I. Administrative Records), which include lists of current members for the year; and in account books in Subseries V. Financial Records.</p>

                        <p>The library records include acquisitions lists, library catalog cards, publishers' catalogs, clippings regarding books of interest for possible acquisition, photographs of the installation of items from the collection at an unspecified location, various unorganized research notes in different hands on subjects including the Lloyd family of Long Island, and the library accession book. The latter documents acquisitions of both published books and manuscript materials, by date and donor, prices paid for items bought, as well as the library's classification system.</p>

                        <p>The Library was formed originally from the collection of John Sanford Barnes, donated to the Naval History Society by his son, James Barnes, in 1915 and included in the New-York Historical Society's library's collections in 1925. These volumes are now cataloged under the XN call number. Materials were added to subsequently, by donation or purchase, with monies from the Naval History Fund.</p>

                        <p>Loose materials originally inserted in the Library Accession Book, including a 1933 rare book auction catalog, details of the Meade donation (see Series 30, Series 31), and a list of portraits of John Paul Jones, have been arranged here chronologically in separate folders.</p>

                        <p>The Naval History Society's publications were based on its manuscript collections, which it acquired by donation and by purchase, beginning with the collections of John Sanford Barnes. The records consist of acquisitions lists, information on donations received, lists of volumes published by the Society, and a bound volume of Naval Records. Its inclusion here is unexplained. Additional information about manuscript acquisitions is included in the Library Accession Book in Subseries IV. Library records.</p>

                        <p>The subseries consists of invitations, programs, clippings, visual and printed materials, postage stamps, and a scrapbook on naval topics. The provenance of these materials is unclear; some of the earlier items may have come from the collections of John Sanford Barnes (see Series 3). Materials separated from named collections include an 1851 invitation to Lieutenant Duer (see Series 14), various undated photographs labeled as from Admiral McCauley (see Series 21), and a 1906 invitation to a Naval Ball honoring Rear Admiral Goodrich (see Series 29).</p>
