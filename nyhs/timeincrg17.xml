            <p>The Time Inc. Administration, Human Resources and Personnel Records span from 1939 to the 1990s and include files from Rosemarie Di Sapio, Director of Administration; Robert Steed, Vice President, Personnel Director; and John Bingle, Vice President, Human Resources. Many of the files from 1939 through the 1950s look like they were retained or collected for reference reasons.</p>
            <p>Topics include Time Inc. budgets and budgets for the Human Resources and Personnel departments; Time Inc. strategic plans; union negotiations and contracts; transitioning employees during business mergers and takeovers such as with the Washington 
                <title render="italic">Star</title>; agenda and materials from the Compensation Policy Committee and Administrative Committee; compensation plans; employee stock ownership plans; healthcare management proposals; implementation of databases or other systems; insurance summaries; pension plans; memoranda discussing implementation or changes of benefits and bonuses; summer internships; Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) changes; marketing materials from outside sources; Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) forms; and employee handbooks.</p>
            <p>While HR and Personnel are not the offices of record for some materials (budgets, strategic plans), these materials are retained here in the event they are the only record.</p>
            <p>Because of the limited date range for these records, it is possible earlier records related to personnel matters were interfiled into RG 1: Subject Files, RG 2: Bio Files or RG 3: Reference Files. The majority of Human Resources and Personnel records created after the mid-1980s may have been handled using the retention policies established at that time and never archived.</p>

            <p>In 1949, the Personnel Department existed independently within Time Inc. with Edward Rhett as its director. Within the department are staff position for Employee Records and Benefits, Interviewing, Orientation, and Medical.</p>
            <p>By 1960, Personnel added staff to oversee the central files. Outside of the Personnel Department, Time Inc. created a position for Corporate Staff Relations. Louis Gratz occupied this position in the 1960 department heads directory.</p>
            <p>By 1970, the directory lists the Personnel Office under Corporate overseen by Vice President of Administration and International Charles Bear. The Medical Office has separated from Personnel, but is an administrative unit overseen by Bear. Within Personnel, Charles Gleason, Jr. is the Vice President and Personnel Director, and William Trent is the Assistant Director. Other staff position remain the same as in the 1960 directory.</p>
            <p>By 1980, the directory lists the Personnel Office under Corporate Administration with Robert Steed as Director and Deane Raley as Associate Director. The Medical Director is part of Personnel again. Personnel has added Affirmative Action Officers, a Director of Staff Development, and Employment Counselors.</p>
            <p>The 1986 Management Directory lists Human Resources (HR) and Administration as separate departments under the Corporate Group, both overseen by the Chief Administrative Officer. HR has Directors of Affirmative Action, Benefits, Compensation, and a Medical Department. Rosemarie Di Sapio is Director of Administration, and Administration includes a Manager of Personnel.</p>
            <p>A memo in Dave Maness's files states that John Bingle is Steed's successor.</p>

                        <p>Union Relations contains the Personnel office's research and work on job classifications, and Time Inc.'s interactions and negotiations with the Newspaper Guild of New York. Besides Steed's records, there are records from Louis Gratz in the Labor Relations office, which was not part of Personnel. These records are comingled with Steed's records, and Steed might have inherited them. The records include meeting minutes and a salary study from the Continuing Classification Committee, copies of union contracts from other news organizations along with other research dating back to 1939, Time Inc. job descriptions, and Time Inc.'s union contracts.</p>
