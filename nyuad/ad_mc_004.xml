    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Conducting Capstone research is a significant part of the undergraduate experience at NYU Abu Dhabi, which every student will engage during their fourth year. Marking the final step before graduating, the year-long research endeavor may result in pursuing an important research question or creative idea, which may take the form of an historical narrative, musical composition, performance, invention, documented experiment, scholarly thesis, or other form appropriate to the student's goals.</p><p>To prepare for their Capstone research, all students enroll in a Capstone seminar, led by assigned faculty in each major or program. Some student research, particularly within the Engineering Division, may be conceptualized as a group project, and may build upon research that was conducted by members of an earlier Class. No matter the pursuit, as the program description states, the student is in charge and challenged "to enter unmapped terrain and to extend oneself in making knowledge, reframing conventional approaches to an issue or creating something new."</p><p>At the end of each spring semester, each of NYU Abu Dhabi's four academic divisions acknowledge and celebrate Capstone Projects in a variety of ways. These celebrations themselves have become traditions. For example, the Division of Arts and Humanities hosts an annual Capstone Festival; the Engineering Division hosts a special website showcase; and various programs and departments across campus celebrate with senior dinners, acknowledgement, and congratulations events. An annual Capstone Projects anthology is also produced and widely shared. As a condition of graduation (as of 2018), students must submit their project to the Library, where the collections is managed as part of the University Archives.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>One of the most frequently used collections of the University Archives, the Capstone Archives is the University's accumulating collection of submitted Capstone senior research projects, beginning with the Class of 2014 and continuing to the present. Submitting their senior Capstone project is a required step for students to complete their undergraduate education at NYUAD and collect their diplomas. </p><p>The collection is a living, growing digital collection that is being preserved by Archives and Special Collections, in the NYU Abu Dhabi Library. The collection represents a diverse sampling of the research, innovation, and creative endeavors of NYUAD undergraduate students. </p><p>Project files consist primarily of text-based essays. Some projects also include other products and deliverables such as copies of films, unpublished novellas, and filmed performances; interactive media files such as programmed Virtual Reality, video game software files, mobile apps, or filmed interactive installations; and supplemental documents such as photographs and design files of installations and prototypes.  As the projects represent all majors across disciplines, a broad range of topics and research areas are explored across the collection. </p><p>In some cases, particularly in the Engineering Division, Capstone projects are group projects, or may continue research that was begun by a previous group under direction of the same faculty member. </p><p>Upon submission, students write and provide their own summary abstracts of the project, which are included as "Scope and Content Notes" of each open project described in this guide. </p><p>Student creators are given the option to restrict their project for a period of time, and some do choose to do so. There are a variety of reasons why this might happen. For example, some students may wish to continue their research beyond their time at NYU Abu Dhabi, and are not yet ready to make it public. This finding aid represents only unrestricted and open projects. Administration of restricted files is managed by Archives and Special Collections staff and follows a rights management timeline. </p><p>In addition to project files, which make up the core of the collection, a series of "Other Capstone Documentation" includes records such as video recordings of students describing their projects; photographs of installations and prototypes taken by campus photographers (as opposed to those submitted by students); and ephemera from Capstone Festivals and events.</p><p>This collection is open to the public, and by far its most frequent user group includes NYUAD juniors and seniors who seek out the collection as they embark on their own research. Student researchers browse and read past Capstone projects, for example, for inspiration; to gauge if an idea has been explored before; to carry on previous research; or, as part of a literature review to integrate into the project essay.</p><p>Members of the public are also welcome to browse and use the collection for research purposes. The Capstone Archives is an open collection. Please refer to "Conditions Governing Access" and "Conditions Governing Use" in this guide for more information about access and use. </p>  </scopecontent>
  <arrangement id="aspace_a7ef4cb7d523275334690dc9e0ed8895">
    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The collection is intellectually arranged into several series, beginning with the four academic divisions. Within those series, projects are arranged into sub-series by major. Within each major, projects are then listed chronologically by submission year, and within each year, alphabetically by last name of student within. </p><p>As each project is considered a unique project, all files will have a component unique identifier, which is the Capstone Project number or "CP#."</p><p>For group projects with multiple authors, the project is arranged alphabetically by last name, and all names of participants are included. Although each individual student's essay is preserved in the collection, only one CP# is applied and the project will only be listed once.  </p><p>A fifth series, "Other Capstone Documentation," includes primarily media from divisional Capstone Festivals. This series is minimally processed, but arrangement of the files correspond to Division and CP# and are accessible. </p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>Capstone Projects and their accompanying supplemental documents are uploaded to an administrative server directly by students, which is managed by NYUAD IT. Instructions and a form are accessible via the NYU Abu Dhabi intranet. Submitted projects are then transferred to Library repositories by the archivists for integration and preservation as part of the University Archives. </p><p>Other Capstone documentation, such as Capstone Festival media, is acquired through various means directly from individual programs, via arrangement with Library digital content specialists, or through regular transfer to the archivist. </p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Processed by Lauren Kata, with assistance from Maria Chaves and student assistants Ian Bryce Hoyt and Muhammad Shehryar Hamid. An original container list for 2014-2016 projects was created in Archivists' Toolkit by Nicholas Martin.</p><p>During the spring and summer of 2020, a reprocessing project was undertaken to accommodate publishing a public finding aid. Work involved the application of consistent naming conventions, removal of Personally Identifiable Information and implementation of a new "CP#" as component unique identifier, as well as a new arrangement scheme by academic division and major to provide a more accessible browse experience for users. At this time, quality control of the digital files was also conducted, preparing them for future and ongoing preservation processing. </p>  </processinfo>

The once-powerful Arab clove planters had lost much of their political influence over the course of the 19th century, and many were heavily in debt to Indian moneylenders. The development of this situation is vital to understanding how colonial policies were implemented and how Zanzibaris navigated the changes which occurred in the early colonial period. This thesis analyzes the current state of scholarship on Zanzibar's early colonial history, and argues that there has been a tendency for studies to rely too heavily on casting 1890 as a turning point, which has the effect of downplaying continuities between pre-colonial and early colonial processes of economic, political, and social change. I advocate for a rethinking of temporal boundaries in future research on this subject, and I examine two processes, the slave trade and the British exploitation of Indian merchants, which demonstrate the theoretical benefits that can be derived from crossing the imagined border between the pre-colonial and colonial eras.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Colonialism   -- History -- Middle East</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Oman</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">Zanzibar</geogname><subject source="lcsh">British Empire</subject><subject source="lcsh">Agriculture/Farms</subject><subject source="lcsh">Enslavement</subject><subject source="lcsh">Debt</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref415_s78" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hennig, Clare Elizabeth. <emph render="italic">The 'Red Line' Of Journalism: Shifting Visions Of The Media In The UAE.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0004</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="7966" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">7966</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_efa67b61d5163fde5e2565531ef777ff">This project focuses on the gap between the vision of journalism in the UAE and the position of the press in practice.

Drawing on fieldwork conducted in Jordan over the summer of 2018 I argue that the Jordan Compact failed to reach target outcomes due to a number of structural implementation challenges, including policy decontextualization and a competitive development architecture. In terms of the empowerment of Syrian refugees, however, the failure of the Jordan Compact was not so much a question of flawed implementation as it was of the "anti-politics" of development-based refugee policy. Syrians in Jordan do not just suffer from "underdevelopment," but also from a weak protection regime that circumvents the question of durable solutions and facilitates exploitation, discrimination, and abuse. In this way, a critique of the Jordan Compact should first and foremost highlight the political failure of the compact to strengthen refugee protection and offer a durable, long-term solution to the refugee crisis.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2d89fc19b6842e66396c9cc544d5269b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mikhalkovich, Alena. <emph render="italic">Perceptions and Practices of Emirati visitors at Louvre Abu Dhabi </emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0027</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_11193a96183f5196d4ace51143db12d4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_11193a96183f5196d4ace51143db12d4" type="Folder">2019-0027</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_77a87f29a1bb37be6a6b54958d853952"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This research studies Louvre Abu Dhabi and the "Roads of Arabia" exhibition, its role in nation-building and UAE branding, and its reception by the local population. Firstly, I examine the museum's reconciliation of local and universal heritage, the UAE nation-building and branding. Secondly, I study Emiratis' reception of such big Western-style museum projects. I argue that Louvre Abu Dhabi brand becomes regionalized and appropriated for UAE nation-branding and regional diplomacy. At the same time, I demonstrate that Emiratis, despite appreciation of the universal narrative, view the museum primarily as a branding project and a tourist-oriented establishment, disapproving its emphasis on the Western culture and insufficient reach out to the local population. Hence, Emiratis desire bigger representation of the local heritage at Louvre, seeing it as worthy of being part of the universal narrative. In addition, I argue that Louvre Abu Dhabi apart from mitigating the nation-building and branding contradictions, gives a way for a young educated upper- and middle-class Emiratis to practice and express their elitist cultural identity in contradistinction to the older, less educated, and religiously conservative Emiratis.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e17da27ac383576a4a85b43a2447fc6c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Plaschke, Jakob. <emph render="italic">LGBT+-Activism in Tunisia: Brokering Progressive Politics Independently</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0001</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_a4481958dabe7b3609e6c6f2d031880b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a4481958dabe7b3609e6c6f2d031880b" type="Folder">2020-0001</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ef5d7c163e236e35c87cae7374ba4831"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Based on two fieldwork trips and extensive interviewing, this capstone looks broadly at how LGBT+-activist organizations function in the political context that is contemporary Tunisia. The capstone consists of four main chapters, each contributing separately to the existing literature on the topic, but also coming together as a whole. The first chapter is a historical account of LGBT+-activism in Tunisia, identifying important periods and ruptures. The second chapter is a contemporary mapping of the Tunisian LGBT+-activist community, focused on organizations' differences, interplay and conflicts. The third chapter argues that Tunisian LGBT+-activists are doing a good job at navigating complex political structures to their benefit and also details the concrete work being carried out. The final chapter argues that if Tunisian LGBT+-activists continue to self-evaluate and improve their ability to assert influence, they have a unique chance to become brokers of broad political alliances over progressive social policies. This is in part due to the fact that LGBT+-rights are not a politically polarizing issue and in part because the organizations are not tainted by affiliations with the Ben Ali dictatorship.	</p><p>Queer, activism, LGBT, Tunisia, North Africa, MENA, politics, history, Tunis</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_22c020d7ee7edf53d56ad50756907f9a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Young Kim, Ji. <emph render="italic">Never كافي: Understanding Emirati Youth Subculture development in Abu Dhabi Specialty Cafes</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0002</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_4686cd69bfecf36271b434d80a227ead" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_4686cd69bfecf36271b434d80a227ead" type="Folder">2020-0002</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a80901f8c26d4839b2f9619b29b11ce8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>With the increased number of specialty cafes in Abu Dhabi, Emirati youth have appropriated cafes as a space of sociability. Through field interviews and ethnographic research, this paper investigates how the influx of specialty cafes has developed the practice of sociability between young Emiratis, and how these spaces of sociability affect their modes of identification. I argue that Abu Dhabi youth transform specialty cafes into a young people's place that is socially acceptable while encouraging them to expand their social circle beyond their family. By doing so, they not only create a subculture inside this social space but also reconstruct social norms to fit the category of the youth. I discuss the themes of anonymity, privacy, gender hierarchy and the performance of identity. Just like the title indicates, there is "never enough" layers and information on how cafes can be understood Abu Dhabi.	</p><p>Abu Dhabi, Youth Culture, Specialty Cafe, Anonymity, Subculture, Gender</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e2e69707b792e014da7e076d668f7bf5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ammagui, Nada. <emph render="italic">Aesthetic Assertion: Taste-Making at the Sharjah Biennial</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0003</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_a33940c10ed26e838529948a8475bd8d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a33940c10ed26e838529948a8475bd8d" type="Folder">2020-0003</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5f1ee58a5c87f7db20fb8cfed9e2220d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Art has long served as a platform for cultural exploration, representation, and exchange, particularly in the space of international art fairs and biennials (Althuser 2008; Kirshenblatt-Gimblatt 2007). From souqs and Kalba Nature Reserve to canopied saris and dancing chess pieces, the Sharjah Biennial, the first art biennial in the Arabian Penninsula, takes visitors on a physical trip through Sharjah and an ideological journey through global contemporary artistic forms and themes. How does the Sharjah Biennial's juxtaposition of local traditions and internationally relevant concerns shape local aesthetic tastes? How do spatial and aesthetic discourses affect these tastes? This capstone paper investigates the effect of these discourses, grounded in local historical narratives, on the creation of aesthetic preferences. With this research, I challenge hegemonic rhetoric on modernization and identity retro-formation in Gulf art scenes by arguing that the Sharjah Biennial draws on local histories to shape its future. I fill a gap in contemporary art and biennial literature by offering the first academic paper on the Sharjah Biennial and by shedding light on the roles of art events in the shaping of local aesthetics, contributing to a wider understanding of contemporary Gulf cultures.	</p><p>Sharjah, UAE, contemporary art, biennials, aesthetics, anthropology, habitus, milieu, exhibition</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c9398406cb0f0f1c5b7f1321bf4a5bf3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Garcia, Sussan. <emph render="italic">Kafala and Binding are Synonyms: A Consequence of Capitalist Class Formation in Ethnic Regimes in the United Arab Emirates and Israel</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0004</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_61433ace0f789b0a447c10bac26f57d6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_61433ace0f789b0a447c10bac26f57d6" type="Folder">2020-0004</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_edbfbe40a4921b9cac964be7edd500d7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This capstone questions the lack of nuance present in the critiques aimed at the kafala system I observed as a student at Abu Dhabi, which was highlighted during my time in Israel, which has a remarkably similar binding system. Unsatisfied by reports that dismissed the kafala as a product of unique Gulf historical or cultural factors, I conducted a comparative historical study of Israel and the United Arab Emirates to determine what forces led to the creation of these privatized visa sponsorship systems. I conclude that universal forces behind capitalist class formation in these ethnic regimes led to the creation of their contemporary labor migration regimes; this is further reinforced by their different scales of labor migration population, which speaks to the longevity of their respective labor migration regime. This capstone compiles labor migration histories of Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and establishes one of the few robust comparisons of these two countries.	</p><p>United Arab Emirates, Israel, kafala, migration, labor migration, binding</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_002442203dc14cb1ad679f7756f4b870" level="file"><did><unittitle>Duborg, Christian. <emph render="italic">Ideologies of Persuasion: an Examination of the Political Rhetoric of Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egyptian and International Media, 1958-1965</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0005</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_12f913fe94bd74c1fc0b9c75befbb201" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_12f913fe94bd74c1fc0b9c75befbb201" type="Folder">2020-0005</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4f105346a4938a2bcaa305889cd43cf0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The goal of this capstone is to use a case study of Nasser's Egypt to examine how governments use the media for political persuasion.

Additionally, the study provides an analysis of historical context, popular discourse, and intended audience to provide a better understanding of the strategic persuasive choices made by the government, as well as an analysis of the nature and role of ideology in Nasser's appeals.

This narrative has traditionally depicted Emirati foreign policy formation as being the sole creation of the capital and wealthiest emirate, unimpeded by the considerations of the other six emirates. This capstone seeks to problematize this narrative as overly simplistic and incomplete. Through investigation into the history and current dynamics surrounding UAE foreign policy formation, this capstone highlights the numerous considerations that affect Emirati foreign policy. It does this by examining three cases: Emirati policy towards Islamism, towards Iran, and Emirati foreign economic policy. Under Sheikh Zayed al-Nahyan, each emirate had limited freedom to formulate foreign policy concerning other states. Since Sheikh Zayed's passing, his son and the de-facto leader of the UAE, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, has worked to centralize the federal government under himself. Understanding Emirati foreign policy as more than just driven by Abu Dhabi is important for any policymaker or academic whose work relates to the UAE.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

While Abu Dhabi Department of Transport (DoT) constructed the urban transportation system to facilitate economic activities and comply to the idealized version of modernity, the public buses are evaluated to be inefficient and reinforce social stratification, further creating social isolation and sense of unbelonging. Moreover, the government's implementation of the transport system seems inefficient and people find strategic ways to navigate the city that challenge or even subvert the intentions of the DoT. Therefore, this paper argues that state-led urban planning and goals often differ from the actual implementation and utilization by residents, a gap commonly found in processes and outcomes of urban planning and transport infrastructure on a global level.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Abu Dhabi's biggest legacy in the realm of the arts may be the introduction of innovative museums like the Louvre Abu Dhabi (2015), the Norman Foster designed Zayed National Museum (2016), and the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi (2017).  However, prior to their public openings a need exists to expose the general community to "museum culture." To address that process, I have completed working on an arts education initiative that focused on building a museum going society. I have worked in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Cultural Authority and Abu Dhabi Education Council on this project and I have developed and conducted workshops with private and international schools in the emirate for 150 students. The works produced during these workshops were exhibited from May 4th, 2014 until May 25th, 2014 at the Manarat Al Saadiyat.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Workshops</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Exhibitions</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Museums</subject><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Community</subject><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Art</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_d847d93919f45b7f6f782bd7af674063" level="file"><did><unittitle>Flores, Cassandra Elizabeth. <emph render="italic">The Not-So-New Kid: The Changing Relationship to National Representation in the National Pavilion of the United Arab Emirates at the Venice Biennale, 2009-2013</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0013</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_1cc50c3000d6bd41c7c34afa7400380c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_1cc50c3000d6bd41c7c34afa7400380c" type="Folder">2014-0013</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2ba24ef49f4e501b0dd568400ab3203c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Visual Arts. This paper explores the brief history of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the Venice Biennale. It addresses the recent and rapid development of the UAE's cultural infrastructure and the history and significance of the Venice Biennale art fair. Due to its continued use of national pavilions, the Venice Biennale acts as a space in which art is presented within a narrative of national identity and representation. However, in recent years many countries have shown pavilions that question or reject the nation-based format. In its time at the Venice Biennale the UAE Pavilion has demonstrated a shift away from overt and largely promotional national representation, in turn towards a critical engagement with the country's history and development, and finally towards an examination of nationhood itself. The alignment of this transformation with prevalent Biennale trends may imply, particularly within the context of the Venice Biennale, a greater appreciation for and emphasis on art on the part of the UAE.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref35_pmi" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hunt, James Baxter IV. <emph render="italic">D-WR</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0017</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="91" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">91</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_b7eb9e5b51b896b413b1dcc75bf4faba" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b7eb9e5b51b896b413b1dcc75bf4faba" type="Folder">2014-0017</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_20cc7f737cc6fe69e19797c4748ca691"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Visual Arts, Political Science<lb/>Abstract: D-WR encompasses the globe.

Both the canvas and the animation, shown side by side, serve to answer questions about both the formation and experience of cultural memory, by revealing in the absolute terms of geography the indeterminate movement of human recollection.

During second half of the 17th century, due to trade and Dutch colonialism, rare goods and luxurious commodities pour into the Netherlands, and become objects of admiration and become subject of the pronkstillleven genre (show-off still life). With this surplus of wealth, a consumerist attitude is born instilling an urge to conspicuously display one's wealth. I analyze the contrast between the two trends and discuss how and why this change took place.

Abstract: This paper goes through a chronological documentation of my capstone project, Psychogeographica. This is a yearlong research project that delves into my personal experience of Abu Dhabi, and particularly how this experience involved me feeling alienated by the space of the city, but not knowing exactly why this reaction had occurred. I recognize that this was because I felt no semblance of time passing – there was no evidence of decomposition or aging within the buildings, streets, sense of place and consequently within myself as I existed within the city. As such, the paper follows the process that led to my collecting found objects and sourced objects in order to create artworks that attempt to reveal the existence of time in Abu Dhabi. The reader is implicated in the mental processes that I faced whilst involved in this yearlong endeavor. There is also an assumption that the reader has encountered the work either in person or through images (which will accompany the archive).</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">United Arab Emirates</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Found objects (Art)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Sculpture</subject><subject source="local">Psychogeography</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref339_7gb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Smits, Cleo. <emph render="italic">PROBE: an investigation of contemporary institutional critique</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0004</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3392" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3392</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_1b8890aeae7d39712ad5762c71e64cdf" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_1b8890aeae7d39712ad5762c71e64cdf" type="Folder">2015-0004</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9151e86369120000224d339d9b282c52"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Art and Art History. Online Project. Abstract: "Institutional critique" is a term used to describe art that is reflective about its positions in institutions and systems within the art world. Institutional critique typically takes the practices that allow art to be exhibited, circulated, exchanged, and sold as the subject of the artwork. This kind of artwork encourages the viewer to reflect on the idea of "the institution" by addressing it both directly and indirectly. 
This exhibition explores three contemporary examples of artists engaging in institutional critique and considers their artwork in relationship to one another, in an historical framework. The exhibition investigates the methods used by artists to identify and address different institutions. This exhibition is a curatorial Capstone project. As a student project, it lies outside the typical framework of "the art institution." Still, the university can be understood as a cultural institution. Thus this project is, ultimately, an experiment in curating institutional critique from within an institution.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Institutional Critique (Art movement)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Art -- History</subject><subject source="lcsh">Contemporary art</subject><subject source="lcsh">Curating</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Exhibitions</genreform></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref412_rzt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kuroda, Mariko. <emph render="italic">Ramadan Recipes: Ten Ideas For Iftar Meals</emph> </unittitle><unitid>2016-0012</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="7963" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">7963</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_cdaf7be0d248f1c0fbc5bff17d67eefb">A 68-page full color book featuring illustrations and photographs, Ramadan Recipes proposes ten iftar recipes to break the fast for each day of Ramadan.

It is an exploration of identity of one's self and as an artist, while seeking to understand the 'betweenness' amidst it all.

He lives both in popular culture and high art. The number of films and television series featuring Vincent van Gogh (1853¬–1890) as a character has long since exceeded one hundred. This thesis questions the difference of seeing reproductions of his paintings on screen rather than the originals in museums or reproductions in books or online. The narrative and accessibility of film medium allows a wider audience to see his paintings in places where his paintings have not been previously exhibited. While translating painted images to the filmic medium cannot reproduce the experience of seeing the originals, van Gogh continues to entice filmmakers from different generations to render different stories about van Gogh and his art on screen. By examining the first major Hollywood film on the artist, Lust for Life (1956), and later Vincent and Theo (1990), and the first fully painted animated film Loving Vincent (2017), I argue how over time technological differences allowed filmmakers to shed new light on the van Gogh myth and his artwork by using film as a means for reaching different audiences.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f8592d172a1231708b9cb16a265e7d20" level="file"><did><unittitle>You, Lauren. <emph render="italic">Shik-gu: The People Who Eat Together</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0032</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_b6c85d1da23cb6a8eeb1172277f30d43" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b6c85d1da23cb6a8eeb1172277f30d43" type="Folder">2019-0032</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8e13b7e64c4d11c16268d6075297ede2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Shik-gu: The People Who Eat Together is a socially engaged art project and a platform for people of NYU Abu Dhabi to connect and provide company for one another through sharing a meal online.   In two months, eight different students broadcasted their dinner live as @eating_at_nyuad on Instagram.With menus ranging from ramen to KFC to half a gigantic watermelon, these students talked about long distance, insecurities, well-being, and body image in the company of their friends and family who followed the account and joined the livestream.   This artwork responds to our community's concerns and offers a platform for conversations, at once intimate and public, that otherwise might remain unexpressed.It explores the vulnerability of putting ourselves online in a meaningful way, of mitigating the loneliness that is amplified by eating on one's own. It connects us to others also participating in the livestream and brings us together as a temporary "family."</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_836a1f41f91a8c57a9d247a1da336d2b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Nuaimi, Hessa. <emph render="italic">The Cultural Foundation in Abu Dhabi, 1981-2008</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0008</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_0db197d4be780c0c0f24ecf626b4429e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0db197d4be780c0c0f24ecf626b4429e" type="Folder">2020-0008</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8863334307912c703043d6fe90e55f5d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>If you were to ask any person who grew up in Abu Dhabi in the 1980s or 1990s, how they spent their free time, they most probably will mention their trips to the Cultural Foundation (CF). While there were other cultural centers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), none compared to the CF. Located in the heart of the city, it attracted people from all over Abu Dhabi and other Emirates because of its reputation as a nexus for writers and artists. The CF played a significant role in the development of Abu Dhabi's art and culture ecosystem. Most importantly, it had sustained engagement with its surrounding community and activated a space for all to be a part of. To this day, many have described the CF as their second home where they attended lectures, workshops, poetry nights, and movie screenings.This paper examines the CF's first active period 1981-2008 and its relationship with the Abu Dhabi's community. The three main questions addressed in this paper are: Why was the CF so popular amongst the community? How was that achieved and what can be learned from that experience?	</p><p>Cultural Foundation, Cultural Institutions, Abu Dhabi, Art and Culture</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_52627b7b2a10ae963f4b06d414c63c41" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ali Al Fardan, Fatema. <emph render="italic">On ​between the three of us: A Visual Arts Virtual Capstone Exhibition</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0011</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_d2de159aafb72cdfe0346afbaa596530" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d2de159aafb72cdfe0346afbaa596530" type="Folder">2020-0011</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fa526b5f6933896ad1268890d166c82c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Between the three of us chronicles my narrative within my family, culture, and stereotypes.</p><p>https://artspaces.kunstmatrix.com/en/exhibition/640751/between-the-three-of-us</p><p>identity, family, culture, stereotypes</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_78bff5f41f595c897dcd683dca238824" level="file"><did><unittitle>Banerjee, Devaki. <emph render="italic">Go Back to Sleep</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0006</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_3c67f17459d6e65941b8a3fe5febd66c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3c67f17459d6e65941b8a3fe5febd66c" type="Folder">2020-0006</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_acf1d27265af72ceeec5c316f05f221e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Go Back to Sleep is a bedtime story, for an overwhelmed young adult.

The names are taken from Arabic and intentionally butchered in their transliteration to play off an ambiguity that often arises during that process.

Though there are many facets of colonialism, I am focusing on how day to day objects define our post-colonial existence. For example, Sri Lankans often wear jeans and T-shirts, even though our sarongs and kurtas are more appropriate for tropical weather. We design our billboards and store signs in English, despite Sinhala and Tamil being more common languages. It is this ubiquitous occurrence, the things that we do not think twice about, that define our colonial legacy.  Card decks and card games are other aspects of this ubiquity. The standard card deck references French royalty, textiles, and patterns, and though we play card games frequently in our culture, we are using a seemingly irrelevant set of cards. When we look at them, they do not reference our own rich, complex, and diverse history. I aim to change that.</p><p>Keywords:

Artist flow is not ignoring the realities of the world, but rather, the ability to use one's being and experiences to enter a meditative space. Subsequently, work is born from an unexplored place within the self. 'astral' consists of a series of prints, paintings, ceramics and other three-dimensional work that embody the discovery of new universes within one's artistic and spiritual self. Personally, creating art is a spiritual experience which is influenced by an interest in witchcraft. The series of work also explores what it means to navigate the world in the female body, and both the pleasure and pain it endures — self-inflicted or otherwise. The creative process leads to psychedelic effects in the works, which can only be described as a result of artist flow. 'astral' is, as such, inspired by the intrinsic, ethereal connection each of us has to the universe; art is simply a means to understand it.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Flow, spirituality, process</p><p>Website: ayaafaneh.com</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_84f359c1ee416541c13701e5b373d0c1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Hosani, Al Reem Ahmed Hussain Ali. <emph render="italic">Of Fragments</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0003</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_b063e2f46a2cf2fc5f30044cca043ee5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b063e2f46a2cf2fc5f30044cca043ee5" type="Folder">2021-0003</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5ee72c232a31c2d22506b7d1afcab1c4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>'Of Fragments' is a series of mixed media works that explore the themes of fragility and complexity.

Under the guidance of the new director, Cristiana Collu, the new display shuffles the artworks from different time periods drawn from the museum collection of art from the 19th to 21st century. The rehang questions previous displays based on linear art history and proposes an experiential encounter with the collection. Since the early 2000s, similar innovative curatorial strategies have been adopted by museums in Europe and elsewhere to address the role of institutions in society with consideration to visitor engagement. By using Time is Out of Joint as a case study, this paper aims to review the original vision of the "national museum" in Italy through the examination of the institutional history in relation to the new display of the permanent collection at the Galleria Nazionale. The analysis of the curatorial approach of Time is Out of Joint contributes to the wider discussion about the relationship between museums, displays, and history. At the same time, the paper will explore how the rehang engages with a new idea of the contemporary art museum.</p><p>Author provided keywords: museum, modern art, contemporary art, curation, rome, display, rehang, national</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5f38fa4e40f13580c6e819f4216dff99" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cho, Mingu. <emph render="italic">Spaces in Hyphen: Of Present-Absence and Absent-Presence</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0008</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_66bd3cf55789c21f2a521c08be45e3ff" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_66bd3cf55789c21f2a521c08be45e3ff" type="Folder">2021-0008</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f945015db885acea8654bda0da2b921b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Capstone research and project, entitled Spaces in Hyphen: Of Present-Absence and Absent-Presence, is a series of photographs that documents spaces around the NYU Abu Dhabi campus.

They are commonly antagonists of the stories in which they feature and thus, serve as a warning, policing women who stray outside acceptable limits of female power, sexuality, or control. Despite this, there is a complexity in the space that the female monster occupies that is compelling. As monsters, women can have complicated emotions and rich internal lives. By centering a narrative on the female monster, I want to create space for deviations and nuance in models of femininity.</p><p>Author provided keywords: feminism, visual art, painting, gaze theory, monstrous-feminine</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e082e3379053bb2a8340bd5064ee1acd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Vu, Hoang Anh Thu. <emph render="italic">To He - A Reflection on Vietnamese Identity, Culture, and Tradition</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0054</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_960a61f3f1ea1471e36de0c6bcabbfb2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_960a61f3f1ea1471e36de0c6bcabbfb2" type="Folder">2021-0054</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6d004aeb643228d9b64e531e1c757d04"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>"To He" is a story about a brother and sister during wartime in Northern Vietnam (1954-75).

This paper examines the aesthetic, philosophical, political and socio-economic aspects of the tea tradition from its origins to contemporary expressions. Under the influence of Shintō beliefs, Zen Buddhism, Daoist philosophy and Japanese aesthetics, the drinking of tea developed into "The Way of Tea" replete with disciplined rituals, a code of ethics, an aura of spirituality, requisite implements and sophisticated aesthetics. The tradition of chanoyu was fluid over time, shifting from the exclusive circles of the nobility, clergy and warrior elite to the interested populus. The merchants through tea trade were conduits for the dissemination of tea culture. This commercial component accounts for the spread of the tea cult from Japan across the world. This analysis explores how the Japanese tea ceremony or chanoyu tradition remained distinctive and coherent while flexible and responsive to change throughout its dynamic evolution. For this reason, I argue, "The Way of Tea" is a significant source of inspiration and creativity for contemporary artists and designers globally.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_3831ea06922d6d385b782f82a2c00c8f" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Film &amp; New Media</unittitle></did><c audience="internal" id="aspace_ref5_uim" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alsaied, Amani. <emph render="italic">Adam</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0103</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="61" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">61</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_99e6229a7490f37121a8bcbfaa4141f2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_99e6229a7490f37121a8bcbfaa4141f2" type="Folder">2014-0103</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c1c36445f49b0243376917a425e61259"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Film and New Media<lb/>Abstract: Adam, a displaced man and a family lost in the midst of the Syrian conflict.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">Syria</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Conflict</subject><subject source="lcsh">Visas</subject><subject source="lcsh">Love</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Short films</genreform><genreform source="lcsh">Drama</genreform></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref8_tgt" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bede-Fazekas, Mate, and Funk, Nolan. <emph render="italic">Two Strangers Meet in a Bar</emph>.</unittitle><unitid>2014-0024</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="63" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">63</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_a5082a6224287603f34929d00bba6ecc" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a5082a6224287603f34929d00bba6ecc" type="Folder">2014-0024</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_82dc735f12bb9745b49a676e64f05542"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Film and New Media<lb/>Abstract: An interactive short film that lets the audience guide the story of a chance encounter between a man and a woman, whose lives are mysteriously connected.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Strangers</subject><subject source="lcsh">Audience interaction</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Short films</genreform><subject source="local">Interactive media</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Narrative film</genreform></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref11_04p" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gatto-Bradshaw, Chani Cree. <emph render="italic">Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Excavation of Professor Ahab</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0014</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="67" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">67</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_86192b22c30d95128645df0c1f10b9e7" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_86192b22c30d95128645df0c1f10b9e7" type="Folder">2014-0014</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5042e19b45b9f98d7b1a1850199562ce"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Film and New Media.

In order to prevent total isolation and loss of self, Alex must overcome his yearning for an unattainable past and his moral absolutes. The film's stark aesthetic construction emphasises Alex's psychological state and underscores his fear of loneliness and his grappling with past trauma. Forgiveness lies at the core of this film: Alex must learn to forgive his crewmates' actions before he can let go of the past.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><genreform source="lcsh">Fiction</genreform><subject source="aat">Narrative (artistic device)</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Narrative film</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Deserts</subject><subject source="lcsh">Loneliness</subject><subject source="lcsh">Forgiveness</subject><subject source="lcsh">Space</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref304_jr5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kleymenova, Kristina. <emph render="italic">Closed Space.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0011</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3374" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3374</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_ffcf43401a0f93453a546ff1a1503ee2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_ffcf43401a0f93453a546ff1a1503ee2" type="Folder">2015-0011</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2beef13a95fe80e64c4959430edc9ad3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Film and New Media<lb/>Abstract: Closed Space is a short film about a guide whose job is to lead human souls to the other side.

Drawing from the vocabulary of a collage of news articles on Syrian refugees, the advertisement of this project echoes the international community attitudes towards refugees. In experimenting with appeals of exclusivity, intimacy, and hints of tragedy, Typing…SYRIA addresses questions of voyeurism, the ethics of witnessing, and the role of the international media's "gaze" towards the Syrian experience in light of the civil conflict.  The performance also invokes prolonged exposure as well as social engagement, as subscribers document their emotional experience throughout the month by contributing screenshots of impactful moments of the conversation, alongside a short written commentary.  At the end of the month, subscribers will be left with not only their own archive of the Syrian voices, but will also have access to the archive of other participants' experiences, comments, and reflections.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">WhatsApp</subject><subject source="lcsh">Refugees</subject><subject source="lcsh">Performing Arts</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Syria</geogname><genreform source="lcsh">Digital media</genreform></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref353_ysp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nagy, Kristian. <emph render="italic">Fair Trade</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0012</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3399" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3399</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_666e0aaad4c3bed6e974654d59f1ab02" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_666e0aaad4c3bed6e974654d59f1ab02" type="Folder">2015-0012</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4415c30c82e4a570e2c7e8320554b3b0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Film and New Media<lb/>Abstract: 'Fair Trade' is a short narrative film that I produced and directed as part of my Capstone Project.

The narrative follows a mother's strife by both perpetuating and fighting the patriarchal society in which she is trapped. As a result, this film aims to show hardships women face in a patriarchal society without villainizing anyone, by demonstrating the struggle the mother goes through when deciding to either succumb to or break out of said society.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xY4SfZQn44</p><p>Women's Oppression, Feminism, Patriarchy, Arabic, Singular Drama</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_33f7f3e21f96d13d059d150144d8703e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pekuse, Liene. <emph render="italic">How We Leave</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0012</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_7cb6f6febabd38afe98bc6171d8ff024" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_7cb6f6febabd38afe98bc6171d8ff024" type="Folder">2020-0012</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a41e962628ab44f965a28af12e7701ad"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The feeling of getting older is familiar to everyone, but still each of us live through it in our own unique way - depending on the experiences we have had and what we have done with them. Identity is fleeting and nothing throughout our lives stays the same. That might be the only consistent thing in it. How We Leave is a short narrative film that shows a day in two girls' lives, in which they have to learn how to grow up. The story examines the way children deal with trauma and perceive adults, what it does to their friendship. Fear follows them no matter how far away from everyone they go, because the biggest monsters truly are hidden within ourselves. Growing up doesn't mean that fear goes away, it means that the person learns how to keep moving forward while being afraid. And it looks like it is much easier to do so if there is a friend on your side.</p><p>Short-Film, Children, Aging Desert</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_87b4ea071861ab71c0b0206a9df12a03" level="file"><did><unittitle>Peterson, Hunter. <emph render="italic">|</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0014</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_052bde56359de1432a917c90c37a20f4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_052bde56359de1432a917c90c37a20f4" type="Folder">2020-0014</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9473d68d234020fe22049fba3b44e502"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>My piece titled "|" is an artistic endeavor exploring the concept of existence through a memoiristic abstraction of reality and realities.

Her older self, however, continues to experience various realities of what her life could have been.

It looks at the dynamic between two African women working at a boutique hotel in Abu Dhabi, and how the space subtly affects their psychological experience. The research process for the film was set off by an article published by Khaleej Times in 2019 detailing the court case of a young Kenyan female who was raped by an Emirati student and allegedly taken to the scene by a male Cameroonian friend. The film's narrative is shaped by interviews conducted with African female migrants in Abu Dhabi along with a written interview with Prof. Yaw Nyarko of NYUAD, whose work focuses on the economic effects of UAE's labor system(s). Other applied sources include testimonials drawn from online articles, book chapters and YouTube videos.

It operates on two levels that speak to each other to create the overarching narrative of the film— the first level is the 'online' context of Zoom, where the characters interact on rectangular screens and attempt to build a fleeting relationship. The second level is the 'offline' context of the UAE, a country where migrants make up the majority of the population and are often temporary inhabitants in the region. This paper addresses the various narrative and cinematic strategies used to highlight that both a Zoom breakout room and the migrant experience in the Gulf are temporary.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Gulf, Migration, Pandemic, Disconnection</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9ff7d0cb4a8942d3157d36eed3135f2b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hagedorn, Sienna. <emph render="italic">A City Gone to Sleep</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0016</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_3675126671e9948480c0aa3f296514a4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3675126671e9948480c0aa3f296514a4" type="Folder">2021-0016</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_64993b1e132d4d90f22f876e052a0442"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A City Gone to Sleep is a documentary detailing the impact of Covid-19 on the restaurant industry in New York City. At its core, the film is a commentary on the crucial role of restaurants in the social, historical, and economic architecture of the city. The restaurant industry employs over 300,000 New Yorkers in over 24,000 locations, many of which have been around for decades. It is a primary employer of immigrants, many of whom have also set up their own establishments. Whether you have been to New York or not, many of us have an image of what New York is supposed to be. Restaurants give character to the streets of New York and serve as reminders of the city's rich diversity.

One day, when Armaan plans to go partying with his friends, their divergent lives serendipitously intersect, unravelling questions of identity, position and privilege in Abu Dhabi. Through Armaan and Ali, who represent two sides of the South Asian migrant experience in the UAE, the film explores the themes of identity, belonging, and masculinity.

It's a city where many young people develop a third culture kid identity – those who grow up for a majority of their youth in countries outside those of their nationality. Specifically, the film is set in a skatepark, where many teenagers living in Abu Dhabi come to meet and socialize. However, often the reality of being a third culture kid is the fluctuating nature of friendship, as expats continue to leave for various reasons. This begs the question: how does this uncertainty of their next years affect their behavior and personality? What does it mean to develop strong relationships with the temporary people around you? How do TCK's react to goodbyes? How did the Covid-19 pandemic further affect these temporary people? POSER attempts to capture the bittersweetness of goodbyes by following two young TCK's, who have unspoken feelings for each other, as they spend one last morning together. Through the use of a rapidly developing yet relaxed skate culture in Abu Dhabi, POSER explores the meaning of home and youth.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Narrative, Fiction, Skateboarding, Skate, 2021</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9a15b7abb4f2c76de5fedb339083a089" level="file"><did><unittitle>Khoory, Latifa. <emph render="italic">Bubbles of Happiness</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0014</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_4f7741c00f7949ca6b4b9c4771dae06d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_4f7741c00f7949ca6b4b9c4771dae06d" type="Folder">2021-0014</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f675514b5149ae87a0adcdbb333ded82"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Bubbles of Happiness tells a story of a bond between two unlikely people that share a mutual appreciation for karak.

Grounded in a practice of self-reflexivity and ethical inquiry, this film intends to raise questions about gaze, positionality and power. Who gets to tell whose story? What does nuanced and ethical representation look like? How do we begin to disrupt the ethnographic gaze?

The goal of The Nine Circles is to explore this concept through an audiovisual approach. For most of history people have believed that a spiritual or mental part of us remains after physical death. Thus, the most direct way for us to explore the "floating" mind is to imagine what the post-death experience could be. My film opens with the death of the protagonist, and what follows is an exploration of that mind, unlinked from physical reality. First the mind feels lost in the dark, but then it slowly learns how to imagine and navigate in a new world of its own. This experience ultimately becomes akin to our own 'living' reality.

From 1947, the tone of those relationships changed substantially, from authoritarian to more collaborative. Recent scholarship suggests that this change was due to a diversification of the educational backgrounds of the British representatives: prior to 1947, all of them had attended public schools, which imbued them with highly imperialistic attitudes. However, after 1947, their education was more diverse, and no longer propagated such an imperial ideology; thus, the British representatives were no longer as authoritarian.<lb/><lb/>This thesis offers a more nuanced version of this argument, by taking into account the prevailing attitudes towards Empire in Britain, as well as pressures on Britain's position in the Gulf from powers in the region. Ultimately, I argue, educational background merely contributed to the change in the relationship; more significant were regional pressures that forced the British representatives to effect policy that necessitated greater collaboration with the local rulers, and thus a change in the nature of the relationship.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">Arabian/Persian Gulf</geogname><subject source="lcsh">British Empire</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Great Britain</geogname><subject source="lcsh">History</subject><geogname source="lcsh">United Arab Emirates</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref15_4st" level="file"><did><unittitle>Manela, Caroline Victoria. <emph render="italic">Violence and Exchange: Middlemen of the Sixteenth- and Seventeenth Century Mediterranean</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0012</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="71" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">71</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_20d3b049a2f6fcd812e255548ff41d17" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_20d3b049a2f6fcd812e255548ff41d17" type="Folder">2014-0012</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8d497d8e5d2edcf07711d784e0f5e582"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: History<lb/>Abstract: Historians of the pre-modern Mediterranean have challenged the argument that the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Mediterranean ceased to exist as a frontier of fruitful cross-religious contact between Christian Europeans and Muslim North Africans. This thesis supports that position by showing that amidst violence, specific types of middlemen, including corsairs, captives, slaves, and diplomats, continued to live in connection with both Christian Europe and Muslim North Africa. I argue for an understanding of religious violence that accepts its tragic and harmful consequences while acknowledging it as an avenue through which cross-cultural and religious knowledge was facilitated. Within this framework, I explore the physical violence of piracy and captivity as well as the concept of structural violence in connection with the career of the Jewish merchant and diplomat Samuel Pallache. Finally, I turn to consider an anti-Christian polemical work that has received limited scholarly attention: Ahmad ibn Qasim al-Hajari's Kitab nasir al din 'ala 'l-qawm al-kafirin (The Supporter of Religion Against the Infidel). The violent language in Kitab nasir al-din was the only way in which al-Hajari could convey stories of his respect and admiration for Christians to his Muslim North African audience.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Violence</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Mediterranean Sea</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Religion</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref16_n4y" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tattersall, Jessica Joan. <emph render="italic">The Doctor as Biographer: The Politics of Intimacy in Historical Biographies of Winston Churchill and Mao Zedong</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0019</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="72" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">72</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_33584248938863c90289914c1092f19e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_33584248938863c90289914c1092f19e" type="Folder">2014-0019</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f7d95ce5bfd41f489b912ca379123b09"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: History<lb/>Major: This thesis compares the politics of intimacy in two biographies written by doctors: Churchill: The Struggle for Survival 1940-1965 (1966) by Charles Wilson (known by his honourary title of Lord Moran), and The Private Life of Chairman Mao (1994) by Li Zhisui. Both Moran and Li spent over twenty years serving as the personal physicians of Winston Churchill and Mao Zedong respectively, forming extremely close relationships in the process.<lb/>All biography written by personal associates raises the question of how such relationships affect not only the content of the work, but also its reception. However, research regarding this question is surprisingly thin, and in turn the question remains largely unanswered. This thesis, by comparing biographical traditions in both England and China, and by examining biographies of Winston Churchill and Mao Zedong, offers specific answers to this question. I argue that a comparative analysis, mindful of the distinctive features of Chinese and English biographical traditions, reveals that the politics of intimacy in historical biography is greatly shaped not only by historical context, but also by present day values.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><genreform source="lcsh">Biographies</genreform><geogname source="lcsh">China</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">England, UK</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Historiography</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref331_9nd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Evans, Laura May. <emph render="italic">Internalising Identities: Internment Camps in Australia in World War II as a Tool of Nation Building</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-004</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3388" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3388</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_5d0d46b78dfafa80521e484f45b38814" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_5d0d46b78dfafa80521e484f45b38814" type="Folder">2015-0014</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9b98424e3c112ca937f98f2080d2b980"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: History<lb/>Abstract: The internment of foreign nationals in Australia during World War II is one example of exclusionary practices used in Australian history to define in and out groups in Australian society. This example often disappears from dominant narratives of Australian military and social history, or internees' experiences are written about in isolated categories of nationalities. This study examines internees' own stories from the Tatura and Loveday internment camps in conjunction with official histories and different trends in writing Australian history. In addition, this study looks at ways internees were forced to confront their own identities through internment and how on exit from the camps, internees were pressured to adopt attitudes in line with Anglo-Australia and internalised their internment experience. Finally, this study shows that recent trends in Australian history have focused on finding space for non-white others and that internment camps need to be incorporated in these histories to understand the forces that have constructed white Australian identities and subsequent politics.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">International migration</subject><subject source="local">Migration</subject><subject source="lcsh">Historiography</subject><subject source="lcsh">Race</subject><subject source="lcsh">World War II</subject><subject source="lcsh">Internment camps</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Australia</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Identity</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref420_zgm" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dinan, Cian. <emph render="italic">Dying Among the Geraniums: Madness in the Congo Free State.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0003</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="7971" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">7971</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_69dc0bdc42120d464cf1709c9a0147cd">At the turn of the 20th century, violent conditions in the Congo Free State colony of Belgian King Leopold II sparked international outcry.

For example, he was a committed follower of Chinese literary culture, an independent politician who valued his family's historical legacy in Chinese statecraft, and a powerful military leader who kept an intricate balance with neighboring forces, including China and Tibet, while expanding his own territory for economic gain.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b2f111385d6da3b01254f4fd5a6beaf1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jiun Tan, Tzy. <emph render="italic">Epistemologies on the Margins of the Malayan Insurgency (1942-1989): Analyses of Selfhood, Gender, and the Jungle in Autobiographies and Memoirs</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0016</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_75150fe6f86c48ff9826da4c9dd2a1bd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_75150fe6f86c48ff9826da4c9dd2a1bd" type="Folder">2020-0016</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_799eedccadf33a9484ff740f8ebe2e8a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This capstone investigates gendered and spatialised epistemologies of the Malayan insurgency.

Using evidence from the Ethiopian Royal Chronicles, hagiographic literature, and European sources, this project claims that the actions, policies, and religiopolitical attitudes of the 17th century Christian Ethiopian king Susǝnyos were shaped by the dynastic memory of his 15th century ancestor Zä'ra Ya'ǝqob. This project explores the internal religious and political history of 15th to 17th century Christian Ethiopia from the height of the Ethiopian medieval period until the end of the Jesuit Period while touching upon the wider intersecting global histories which affected the Christian Kingdom and that Ethiopia affected in turn. By studying Christian Ethiopia through the lens of memory, this capstone reexamines the role of history making in general, and medieval Christian Ethiopia in particular, reflecting upon the impact of royal education on political and religious policies implemented by the emperors of medieval Christian Ethiopia.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Ethiopia; Africa; Memory; Monarchy; History; Christianity; Dynasty; Historiography; Religion</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_79bffbf77fed7c4c91c1c6d101942fe8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Thomas, Thais. <emph render="italic">Tracing Black Power: Revolution and Memory in Trinidad and Tobago</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0021</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_6fff9aa7dcad02a071abeee7ca83a60c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_6fff9aa7dcad02a071abeee7ca83a60c" type="Folder">2021-0021</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6ee527192347ecd67cfee15be7a408e9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In February of 1970, the Black Power Movement took over the streets of Trinidad and Tobago, taking inspiration from contemporaneous movements in the wider Caribbean, North America, the United Kingdom and beyond. This capstone argues that the Movement in Trinidad and Tobago was a transnational exercise in shared blackness which manifested in varied ways that were specific to the Trinbagonian experience. This capstone does not frame global Black Power as emanating from a North American core, but as a Movement in which underling connections created an environment of collective radical black action in the late 60s and 70s. It uses memory as a lens into the 1970s, and also as a connector to the complicated contemporary Trinbagonian experience with blackness, specifically in the Movement's 50th anniversary. Based upon the oral testimony of individuals who lived through the Movement, the project illuminates various transnational themes such as black consciousness, black ideology and black cultural practices. Parallel to these connections, it looks at the localised manifestations of Black Power in organisations, cultural artforms and in spirituality to demonstrate that Trinbagonian Black Power arose out of the particular historical experience of Black persons in the Caribbean.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ecbc324169b86639ec2c0c2b84dbbe82" level="file"><did><unittitle>Vavrova, Tracy. <emph render="italic">Opposing the EU: Historical Legacies of Eurocriticism and Euroscepticism in France, 1950-1992</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0022</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_e518cc3f3fd9984f3cea7670c0f5f14a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e518cc3f3fd9984f3cea7670c0f5f14a" type="Folder">2021-0022</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a336d8457e1d998f6e225586882b7519"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The project chronicles the evolution of Eurocritical and Eurosceptic sentiment in France between 1950 and 1992 to determine whether Eurosceptic ideas in the country today appeared in public and political discourse prior to the Maastricht Treaty referendum in 1992. Scholarly consensus denotes the referendum as the first time in French history when Euroscepticism affected French political outcomes. Contrarily, this study demonstrates that French foreign and national policy has consistently displayed Eurocritical attitudes since 1950. Such sentiment has significantly affected political outcomes on a national and EU level, culminating in the rise of Eurosceptic political parties and policies long before 1992. The study synthesizes numerous newspaper articles, speeches, interviews and public opinion polls to reveal several frequently cited concerns regarding national sovereignty, the gradual loss of French influence over European affairs and complex relations with Germany and the United States. The project demonstrates that France's foreign policy interests have consistently been at odds with the European integration process. Exploring this tension reveals a historical legacy of French hesitation towards the EU; one firmly ingrained in political and public discourse and one playing a key role in French and European political outcomes.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Euroscepticism, Eurocriticism, foreign policy, legacies, European integration, European Union</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_da95fcdd006b23ad1eb16ffa2fa51e80" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Interactive Media (2020 - )</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dd959aa00e74506b9eed47913885815b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Earlier projects related to interactive media may be found in either Art and Art History (visual arts) or Film and New Media sub-series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_7c316966588d09254ad5fe205b9c19c2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Almazroeei, Lateefa. <emph render="italic">Homo Ludens // Learning to Play</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0017</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_309bef94079cab0b700df5e2bc88b128" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_309bef94079cab0b700df5e2bc88b128" type="Folder">2020-0017</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c7d1e11fd0ac91f0fb3e26195e4cf979"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Homo Ludens // Learning to Play is an Interactive Media project which consists of a guidebook and a single game that is about using games for learning through play which is meant for both class-room and non-classroom oriented environments.

How can meaningful interactions help to create this comfort? These are the two overarching questions my Capstone project addresses. Informed by key ideas from Situationist International and Sherry Turkle, my Capstone seeks to react to these theorists' concepts by considering them in relation to our current situation with social media. Overall, composed of two experiences: a social media daring game and an interactive installation, my Capstone invites people to reconsider their relationship with social media and their use of it as well. As subjects to the attention economy that drives and monetizes social media, it is imperative for social media users to be aware of its implications and to have some critical understanding of the dynamics at play. In light of this, the two components of my Capstone project strive to facilitate this understanding.</p><p>https://simulacra.myportfolio.com/</p><p>social media, art, game, simulacra, spectacle</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_cc15955f4f9030b394e6d925c1c93b45" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lootah, Mai. <emph render="italic">mirari</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0019</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_2a76c115c9c014f940feecc3257a2c35" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_2a76c115c9c014f940feecc3257a2c35" type="Folder">2020-0019</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d317b4039a7bef61f79aebaadf1913c2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>During the period of Fall 2019 to Spring 2020, I began my process of brainstorming, prototyping, playtesting and finalizing my Capstone Project, mirari.

I began with the themes of reality, perception, light, landscape and infinity. Throughout the building process, I went through several experimentation stages and prototypes, welcoming new methods and ideas which all connected to the elements I had chosen. Integrating the historical and theoretical themes that helped me polish and contextualise my project.

Accessed through a link hosted on a service called Ngrok, users are presented with an interface similar to Windows Paint, but built using p5.js. The program has three areas: a set of instructions, a canvas for drawing and a minimal tool set derived from common drawing apps, which includes a color picker, the ability to change brush size and an eraser. While users are interacting with each other through the canvas, on the backend there is the Mischievous Algorithm that changes the users' work in ways that only a computer could do.The project reverses the expected behavioral roles of human vs. machine through an interface where the user follows direct instructions to create a piece of digital art, while the interfering code creatively and unexpectedly modifies it.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

The installation addresses this neglected issue by offering two intertwined components on NYUAD campus. The first component is a socially distanced outdoor installation that makes invisible air pollution hypervisible, allowing us to see ourselves in relationship with the microscopic particles we breathe in. The second component is a network of air quality monitoring stations across campus (Campus Center, Dining Hall, and outside of Arts Center), providing real time air quality data and health suggestions.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Because a large portion of these laws come from the EU or international conventions that have been brought into local legislation, primarily the Human Rights Act of 1998, I want to study the implications Brexit may have on an uncodified and EU derived conception of Human Rights. Aside from theoretically analyzing this through the law and bills and acts, I aim to survey UK residents or citizens- i.e. those who the laws and possible change in the provision of human rights in the UK impact. In my survey, I will try to understand whether the subjects know about how their rights are provided in the UK, whether they feel a gap due to the uncodified nature of the constitution and whether they know the impact Brexit may have.	</p><p>Human rights, UK, Constitution, Unwritten Constitution</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8e7c9c49a350260dce34ac2f50f3e9c3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pearce, James. <emph render="italic">The Ethical Ramifications of Artificial Intelligence in the Legal Profession</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0021</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_94ef2f0d5b35c1c5d86cab4c06fb9c3a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_94ef2f0d5b35c1c5d86cab4c06fb9c3a" type="Folder">2020-0022</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_353de9e96c28f733eeb8715ee967a104"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Artificial intelligence is disrupting most traditional industries, and the legal sphere is no exception. Artificial intelligence offers the potential to greatly increase access to the law, particularly for low-income clients, but raises many serious ethical questions. These questions include, first, the extent to which artificial intelligence can offer competent legal representation, and second, whether additional regulation is required to protect individuals from incompetent representation or breaches of confidentiality. Artificial Intelligence will alter the relationship between lawyer and client, and require from lawyers a keen understanding of developments in this nascent field. These ethical concerns give rise to issues of regulation and legal education. This paper analyses the current state of Artificial Intelligence in general, as well as its current and potential future impact on the legal profession.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2e7666cdbb470a158be0ea7357d5447b" level="file"><did><unittitle>AlFardan, Maryam. <emph render="italic">By Capitalism: An Environmentalist Approach to Implementing a Sustainable Capitalist Economy in the United Arab Emirates</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0034</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_7bb80090157a266c6fd00d544278c285" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_7bb80090157a266c6fd00d544278c285" type="Folder">2021-0034</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b35eb943da8f7a5932a0ad423195aaf2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The growing economies are risking the environment.

It discusses nepotism in other countries and considers current responses to nepotism in various countries. Nepotism in Kuwait is the focus of the thesis. The following factors of Kuwait are considered: legal system, National Assembly, politics and the Al Sabah family, the meaning of money laundering, Kuwait's law on money laundering, Malaysian Fund Case, Social Media Influencers case, and Bangladesh MP Shahid Islam case.

I argue that each novel contains a specific anxiety over whether—and under what conditions—eating meat is ethically justifiable, and that in each case this anxiety stems from questions about how humans draw distinctions between their own species and nonhuman animals. Each novel also demonstrates an awareness that these boundaries, both between humans and nonhumans and between different species of animals, are often arbitrary and subject to change. Fundamental human ambivalences in how to relate to different species of animals lead to the physical ambiguity of meat; acknowledging these ambivalences results in a "cannibal anxiety", or anxiety over whether eating nonhuman flesh is any different than eating human flesh. I will examine how these novels reveal or suggest ways of dealing with these ambiguities and their resultant anxieties, and how they challenge the reader to rethink both their meat-eating practices and their wider relationships to nonhuman animals in general.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">Canada</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Meat</subject><subject source="lcsh">Ambiguity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Anxiety</subject><subject source="lcsh">Animals</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref19_xga" level="file"><did><unittitle>James, Katherine Delia. <emph render="italic">World Literature in Spanish: Realismo Mágico from Vela to García Màrquez</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0022</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="75" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">75</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_671d6525f267e0227575dfa2616c7721" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_671d6525f267e0227575dfa2616c7721" type="Folder">2014-0022</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2ce7ccb3fd71e9c659a30ebf2b03dd60"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Literature<lb/>Abstract: This thesis explores the forgotten history of both world literature in Spanish and the circulation of magic realism through Madrid to Latin America.

In creating realist narratives of resistance to colonialism and neocolonialism, these writers have implicitly cooperated with western literary critics who insist on reading literary works by African-born writers as anthropological accounts of life in "Africa." Nigerian-born author Buchi Emecheta's critical reputation was built around her early realist fiction, which critics continue to read as anthropological accounts of a universally African female experience. This paper reads Emecheta outside this critical paradigm by focusing on her only work of speculative fiction, The Rape of Shavi. Ultimately, reading Emecheta's work in relation to The Rape of Shavi suggests new modes of reading the canon of African women's fiction.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Anthropology</subject><subject source="lcsh">Realism</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Nigeria</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">West Africa</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Feminism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref347_a6l" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kelani, Naila Hafiz. <emph render="italic">On leaving a little smarter: Navigating space and a "minor" identity in transvergent post-beur cinema.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0016</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3396" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3396</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_ff29b74672789dd69188ffa932670cd6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_ff29b74672789dd69188ffa932670cd6" type="Folder">2015-0016</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b494a26303ab8d40ab13f75956fbafe9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Literature and Creative Writing<lb/>Abstract: Cinéma beur has traditionally been treated as a sociological cinema documenting the 'real' French-Maghrebi experience. The young protagonists of Jacques Audiard's Un Prophète (2009) and Mohamed Hamidi's Né Quelque Part (2013) navigate between Frenchness, Arabness, and Muslimness in ways that render their complex identities institutionally irreconcilable. Throughout the films' narratives, they encounter changing conceptions of their overlapping identities in the context of their movements through spaces via temporal and metaphorical journeys within (and without) the French Republic.<lb/>Borrowing Will Higbee's notion of 'post-beur' cinema, I argue that these films resist being read through the realist, sociological, and postcolonial lenses that differentiate, if not the films themselves, then the analyses that they invite, from the "beur" generation. They mark a departure towards a transvergent cinema that deconstructs notions of center and margins, incorporating Deleuze's rhizome towards a reading of how the features and inconsistencies of a racialized French society serve as catalysts towards these characters "becoming" minoritarian.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">Algeria</geogname><geogname source="lcsh">France</geogname><subject source="local">Beur cinema</subject><geogname source="lcsh">North Africa</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref329_kb9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Leith, Sachi. <emph render="italic">Unsettling Nomadism: Becoming-Minor in Galsan Tschinag's Die Rückkehr</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0019</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3387" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3387</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_b893a5f41df1b4769fb313643c8036f3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b893a5f41df1b4769fb313643c8036f3" type="Folder">2015-0019</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_916c646d0aa866161e18083e639c1d69"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Literature, History<lb/>Abstract: The study of non-ethnic German authors, of increasing importance to German literature, has traditionally focused only on those within Germany. The enigmatic work of Galsan Tschinag, however, a Tuvan Mongolian shaman and author of thirty books in German, provokes a radical re-imagination of the contours of German literary and linguistic history. His fictionalized autobiography Die Rückkehr: Roman meines Lebens [The Return: Novel of my Life], the most aesthetically self-conscious of his texts, invokes Mongol, Soviet, Tuvan, and European literary forms to weave together Central Asian and European histories. I read Die Rückkehr in conversation with Deleuze and Guattari's Toward a Minor Literature, whose emphasis on language as a deterritorialized, dynamic space of imagination, rather than an entity circumscribed by national boundaries, allows me to analyze Tschinag's work within the broader contexts of German and Mongolian literatures, and of minor literatures in general. The text's formal experimentation and staging of autobiographical truth through fiction allow the author to comment on both post-socialist Mongolia and contemporary Germany. By revealing the various traditions that converge in his work, I argue for a more integrated understanding of Eurasian history via German as a global language.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">German language</subject><subject source="local">German Writing</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Germany</geogname><subject source="local">Postsocialism</subject><subject source="local">Deterritorialization</subject><subject source="lcsh">Postcolonialism</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Mongolia</geogname><occupation source="lcsh">Shamans</occupation><subject source="lcsh">Nomads</subject><subject source="local">Minor literature</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref335_d0a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sutherland, Jamie Alexander. <emph render="italic">'The Time-Devouring Nightingale': Toward A Borgesian Conception of World Literature </emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0008</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3390" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3390</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_dd2cb518e23928541ebf55b1be9d369f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_dd2cb518e23928541ebf55b1be9d369f" type="Folder">2015-0008</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_48cf101f146de9930a41d1e2eec8af47"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Literature<lb/>Abstract: Many of Jorge Luis Borges's works reject linear understandings of time, allowing him to rewrite history and tradition. Borges uses translation to reshape his literary heritage, as well as his own national history. This practice is exemplified by his 1925 translation of the last page of James Joyce's Ulysses in the publication Proa, which recreates Ulysses in Buenos Aires and, when published, challenged conceptions of what Argentine literature should look like. His Antología de la literatura fantástica ('Anthology of Fantastic Literature'), which includes other translated portions of Ulysses, upsets traditional understandings of the canon, periods of literary history, and traditional practices of translation. My project explores Borges's unconventional understanding of chronology to consider how his literary texts unsettle orthodox understandings of world literature, as well as of Argentine history and literary tradition. An alternative conception of world literature based on a non-linear sense of time elucidates Borges's own works, as well as Joyce's Ulysses, and suggests how current dominant models of world literature could be reimagined.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><title source="lcsh">|a Joyce, James, |d 1882-1941. |t Ulysses</title><subject source="lcsh">Spanish language</subject><subject source="lcsh">World literature</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Argentina</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref429_2tx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hu, Zoë. <emph render="italic">Disorderly Time in Jhumpa Lahiri and Amitac Ghosh: Narrative Studies as a Strategy for Reading Migration Novels.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0018</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="7980" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">7980</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_f3de6ff94ea0720f41e7ba2c037d4012">This project relies on the field of narrative studies to demonstrate how migration novels by Lahiri and Ghosh espouse conceptions of migration temporalities that stray from the irreversible, often times oppressive, model of linear time.

The project draws on Walter Benjamin's notion of messianic time to call attention to the ways in which the novels interrupt patriarchal and imperialist productions of history.

Encouraged by his mentor Harriet, he decides to leave Reality 6 and venture to Reality 12. However, he gets trapped there.

It was only when Hong Kong identity faced the "double trauma of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 followed by the Tiananmen Massacre of 1989" did people realize that "the Hong Kong way of life with its mixture of colonialist and democratic trappings was in imminent danger of disappearing" (Abbas 6-7). The 1997 Handover, which, marked the return of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, then, became a deadline against which the city's writers utilized different strategies to preserve Hong Kong's postcolonial identity, to resist the imminent threat of identity decolonization and potentially, recolonization. This thesis specifically will investigate the specific strategies used by Leung Ping Kwan and Louise Ho in their poetry to preserve Hong Kong's postcolonial identity, looking towards yet another deadline in 2047- when the "One Country, Two Systems" arrangement that currently governs Hong Kong is set to expire.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f82a5402e9b24a6ac378f2e64b862891" level="file"><did><unittitle>Zhang, Eva. <emph render="italic">Grotesque Melancholies</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0017</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_babc8170e0d926b2d104d18429c1a11a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_babc8170e0d926b2d104d18429c1a11a" type="Folder">2019-0017</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c62ee49cb68c76b29670cf94aecd4aa4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>'Grotesque Melancholies' is a long poem that sets out to explore the balance between Eva's own creative voice and her passion for the work of T.S.

When they take on a more active role in the narrative, it is to be in the service of others. This capstone project sought to understand the nature of sports manga's "soft power" in contemporary culture through exploring the connection between the conservatism of sports manga's gender politics and its popularity. This conservatism is the lingering legacy of Japan's encounters with Western attitudes and ideals, especially in terms of athleticism and womanhood, which have been adapted into Japanese cultural norms. Examples included deference to hierarchy and images of masculine strength. The prevalence of such norms, as evidenced by its representation on the pages of modern sports manga like Furudate Haruichi's Haikyū!!, this project's case study text, hinders modern manga from realizing its full potential to be progressive.	</p><p>"sports manga," Japan, manga, Haikyū!!</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5234b4d6f067105ee927735b7ebfc5ac" level="file"><did><unittitle>Golovakova, Ria. <emph render="italic">The Trouble with Utopias and Humans: Posthumanism in Politics and Folklore in Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's Monday Starts on Saturday and Tale of the Troika</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0031</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_3eb6b66fcea97171e0e4ccf5e0e46d4b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3eb6b66fcea97171e0e4ccf5e0e46d4b" type="Folder">2020-0031</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_93da5fcaebe72b76cb584218400116dc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>"Like all science," says Roman Oira-Oira. "Our work deals with human happiness." Oira-Oira, one of the most respected employees of the National Institute for the Technology of Witchcraft and Thaumaturgy (NITWiT), announces this claim in the first chapter of Arkady and Boris Strugatsky's utopian novel Monday Starts on Saturday (1965). Within the text, his statement is not hyperbolic: the fictional Institute is centered around improving the human condition and contains a Department of Linear Human Happiness, a Department of the Meaning of Life, and a Department of Eternal Youth. This project examines different ideas of utopia – political, scientific, and literary – within a cycle of hope and disillusionment as the narration shifts from the realistic to the fantastical in both Monday Starts on Saturday and its sequel Tale of the Troika (1968). I look at how different conceptions of human nature intertwine and conflict with utopian visions within the Soviet communist ideology, expressed through representations of folkloric characters and magic systems. By zooming in on the mechanics behind the fantastical, this project crafts an analytical approach to deconstructing utopia and understanding human nature.	</p><p>Strugatsky, Soviet literature, science fiction, utopia, posthumanism, folklore</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b1329690811d5a2da4f2d9618f4239ce" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gutierrez Carrera, Julian. <emph render="italic">The Liminality of Visual Novels</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0027</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_5c3464cdc71894a5833f502dc51612bf" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_5c3464cdc71894a5833f502dc51612bf" type="Folder">2020-0027</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0fd939c28656ee53b42a51d23b6537a5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Visual novels are a form of video game that occupy an odd space within the label of "video games," but there is something odd about them: although they are considered video games, most of the gaming experience consists of reading and experiencing a narrative.

Since VNs have this gameplay factor in them, they have never been theorised as part of Literature. But since their gameplay is limited and most of their focus is on story, they are not theorised as part of Game Studies either.

My capstone is shaped by Moji's accusation. In my paper, I consider Moji's rape to be the founding rupture of the novel: Open City arises, in other words, in response to this disastrous event in Moji's and Julius's lives. Troubled by the rape — which he has forgotten — and by its reminder through Moji's accusation, Julius, I suggest, writes Open City as an attempt to recreate the innocent, pre-lapsarian wholeness that was lost when he raped Moji. Along the way his attempt at totality is disturbed by race, gender, history, all three embodied foremost by Moji.	</p><p>race, gender, totality, aesthetic theory, sublime, history</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_48bb8a78bb7423a6d489b47dabdd3556" level="file"><did><unittitle>Satterfield, Scout. <emph render="italic">The End of the World and Other Experiments</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0032</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_4a9c6de46ca1bab93d58bb00ad1ec81a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_4a9c6de46ca1bab93d58bb00ad1ec81a" type="Folder">2020-0032</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4032d5640533833e89850f7ad90be537"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This collection of short stories explores form, style and voice in storytelling.	</p><p>Short story, Creative writing</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_a96bab95b2c4e734d4dcc0c5250287b7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sinha, Vamika. <emph render="italic">Cranes</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0023</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_0e9a3336eeb34e0436a0ce543fa1cd7e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0e9a3336eeb34e0436a0ce543fa1cd7e" type="Folder">2020-0023</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bd77e256912177a9ea5a37689cb6c1d3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Cranes is a collection of poetry and creative non-fiction bridging cosmopolitanism and women of color (WOC).

In the introduction, I show that scholars have considered it either a historical text or a literary one—but never both (or neither). I situate Hazz in the ʿajāʾib and riḥla traditions to explore questions of fact, fiction, ethnography, and, ultimately, encyclopedism. I read al-Shirbīnī contra Evliya Çelebi's Seyahâtnâme. This reading reveals a textual epistemology that is not concerned with fact per se, but with truth-value. Next, I turn to the questions of structure and genre; I explore the structure of Hazz. I draw on Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's notion of the rhizome to theorize the structure of the Kommentaranthologie. I also engage Jacques Derrida's discussion of the "supplement" and his "law of genre" to theorize how Hazz exceeds the genre it situates itself in. I then speculate about the possible social purpose of the text's structure. Finally, I reflect on this thesis's contribution to undoing the problematic inḥiṭāṭ narrative, and explore alternative pathways to problematize this paradigm by situating the text within (a) Mediterranean literary history. </p><p>Author provided keywords: literary commentaries, Ottoman Arabic literature, postclassical Arabic literature, genre, encyclopedism		</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b6a57c0a08c56f3a48a34be75ffa083e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alhamali, Einas. <emph render="italic">An English Translation of Christmas in Mecca by Ahmad Khairi Al-Omari</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0041</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_35a081b0bc1ffad444c18da161105efa" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_35a081b0bc1ffad444c18da161105efa" type="Folder">2021-0041</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_30773f9ce62a0e443fbbc3d103b5005a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>My Capstone is a translation of some parts of the Arabic novel Christmas fi Mecca, or Christmas in Mecca.

Ultimately, what the comedians argue in their specials has consequences for how we consider standup comedy and its potential for social reform in the #MeToo era.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Comedy, #MeToo, Dave Chappelle, Hannah Gadsby, Rhetoric, Pain</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b103deea55d08cc26d159a81a883b8eb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lim, Chaerin. <emph render="italic">Afterwards: Five Tales Written in the After</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0036</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_a6abd89f7147c054fc0701b6c7618e7b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a6abd89f7147c054fc0701b6c7618e7b" type="Folder">2021-0036</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b5d877a7426c4af5abdefb6f87a1798b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This short story collection is a personal project that reflects on and records specific moments that I have experienced during my time at NYUAD, but in fictionalized form. It is a diary that records striking or overwhelming memories that have pushed me to reevaluate what to hold on in life. By writing these tales, I aimed to move away from the memories that each character manifests, and towards an afterwards; the fact that there exists such an afterwards—that I got to step away from the past and materialize snippets of valuable thoughts and feelings on paper—is what matters. The project consists of a lyric poem and five short stories that are different in setting, narrative style and form, and point of view. While each story centers on the keyword of "after-life," it also stretches for something bigger than the boundaries of an afterlife. Each character encounters some experience with death, but more so, find themselves alone and isolated from the rest of the world. Join these vulnerable characters on a journey of loneliness and fragility, as they navigate and grapple their way through life and contemplate what is to be left afterwards.</p><p>Author provided keywords: afterlife, loneliness, vulnerability, loss</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_408f9012782f8bb86378dd80eeab3baa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Menon, Andy V. <emph render="italic">Poothan and Thira</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0039</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_5de563494d58263763040eb9531d9dc0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_5de563494d58263763040eb9531d9dc0" type="Folder">2021-0039</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_76b26e29a05b22594df5c2b75c0901b3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This submission from my novella is inspired by the mythology of the small village of Thozupadam in the state of Kerala, India. At the centre of the lore and legends lies the Poothan and Thira, an artistic ritual performance that has been around for over 200 years. This novella aims to reflect the village's growing concerns about religious and cultural heritage disappearing, by following the life of a boy named Kutty and his family who have inherited the ritual. When prompted by a choice between preserving tradition and promising opportunities outside the village, Kutty's beliefs in the village gods, demons, and magic stagger as he grows. The ghouls of the village send one of their own, Poothan, on a task to regain Kutty's faith. The supernatural entities must ensure that the boy fulfils his fate of inheriting the ritual himself so that the cycle of tradition is undisrupted, and so that their survival is not threatened, even if revival requires unorthodox means.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Folklore,  Kerala, Heritage, Fiction, Ritual, Tradition</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9b79a9a86e1788cd1f9ab17307795f0e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nirmala Dious, Aathma. <emph render="italic">Thoo!</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0038</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_222b445bc943c7d461670c3811ba0352" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_222b445bc943c7d461670c3811ba0352" type="Folder">2021-0038</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_18cd10b10e9ad7d4606ef8c447562633"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In an alternate timeline, the city of Abu Dhabi is made out of buildings controlled by the PES, a mechanical system that expels residents from their apartments when it is their time to leave. The fictional novel follows Anaswara, a Malayali expat woman born and brought up in this city. Anaswara is now a 25-year old researcher who digs deeper into her childhood home and writes about her life in the PES. However, her past comes crashing into the present when an old friend, Nourah, contacts her to help with an investigation that connects together a series of deaths from 2008, to the PES system crash in 2015—the same one that forced Anaswara and her family out of Abu Dhabi.

Additionally, the field has been characterized by its rejection of misconceived Oceanian "smallness," which has belittled the region socio-politically and geographically. But if scholars such as Epeli Hau'ofa refer to Oceanian lands as the root of Oceanian identity, then what of those who, under colonialism, were forcibly brought to labor on that very land? This paper seeks to expand upon such frameworks of Oceanian postcolonial studies in regard to identity and "smallness," and aims to examine them through an analysis of Satendra Nandan's "The Wounded Sea". Firstly, this paper argues that "The Wounded Sea" explores Oceanian identity on the national and regional level; and, that the novel not only interrogates the pillars of Oceanian identity— land and ocean— but also renders them active agents in reasserting Indo-Fijian belonging. Secondly, this paper argues that the "The Wounded Sea" is an Oceanian novel that pushes back against conceived Oceanian "smallness," by engaging in wider discourses of literature and genre, and ultimately situating itself in a larger postcolonial literary tradition.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Oceania, identity, indigenous, Indo-Fijian, postcolonialism, literature, history</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e1c202a61e2b7c39bafa41845a40a966" level="file"><did><unittitle>Uy, Jamie. <emph render="italic">Star Wars and the Eco-Politics of Survival</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0044</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_bbb64e4e10e95e8bf60448ecc1503d3c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_bbb64e4e10e95e8bf60448ecc1503d3c" type="Folder">2021-0044</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4c790c563162d6b0519c5871766e3980"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>From the scrappy Millennium Falcon to barren, backwater planets, the Star Wars universe revolves around junk, trash, and waste. Through the perspective of material ecocriticism, however, representations of so-called "dead" matter in Star Wars reveal how nonhuman elements of the environment are never truly inanimate. These representations prompt us to recognize the surprising "force of things," an experience which Jane Bennett summarizes as "thing-power," or "the curious ability of inanimate things to animate, to act, to produce effects dramatic and subtle" (Vibrant Matter 6). This capstone expands the boundaries of material ecocriticism, which has demonstrated relatively little interest in the thing-power of media, while bringing material ecocriticism to popular cinema. I analyze stereotypically inanimate matter or "lesser" life-forms (such as the Tusken Raiders, the Death Star, and carbonite) to argue that Star Wars casts the nonhuman as agentic across its sprawling storyworlds. Along the way, I track how eco-philosophy evolves throughout almost fifty years of Star Wars history. Analyzing Star Wars as a global transmedia phenomenon illuminates how our media environments and natural environments are enmeshed, embedded, and continuously interact. Ultimately, Star Wars advocates for an eco-politics of survival by expanding the definition of the "Anthropos" in the Anthropocene.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Star Wars, material ecocriticism, science fiction, popular culture, Anthropocene</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_108c75808624228618a5eb28e5738166" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Music</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref21_lhz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Heo, Seonmin. <emph render="italic">Recreating Performance Styles of Fats Waller, Erroll Garner, and Art Tatum Through Computer Programming</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0027</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="77" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">77</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_3e439ef14b3903483e9b399cbbef20c2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3e439ef14b3903483e9b399cbbef20c2" type="Folder">2014-0027</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5d5cbdcab350f18a6a0da10c3d21decc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Music, Economics<lb/>Abstract: I created a computer program using Max, a visual programming language, to generate jazz piano solos that imitate the performance styles of Fats Waller, Erroll Garner, and Art Tatum.

Intermixtures between contemporary styles and folk music are important because of their ability to revive old genres that are not as present in the lives of today's generations anymore. This paper explores ways to create such fusions between Romanian folk music and the Electronic Dance Music genre "Dubstep" through three versions of the Romanian folk song "Ca pe luncă" created in the Digital Audio Workstation Logic Pro. The first version is simply a recreation of "Ca pe luncă" with digital and recorded instruments. The second version was created with the intention of keeping a larger amount of the Romanian piece intact, preserving its meter and tempo. The last version was made to preserve the meter and tempo of the Dubstep genre, thus keeping more of its main characteristics.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_fd5b7cff91643207f1d3ebeac438e7f3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Vaidya, Himag. <emph render="italic">Analyzing the transformative effects of Music Production on the Expressive Value of a Composition</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0005</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_6a858dfd17d76bef2a2d9f94a81879c4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_6a858dfd17d76bef2a2d9f94a81879c4" type="Folder">2019-0005</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c981d9fee11e2d161209a9265f4af25e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Through this capstone I aim to examine how music production can act as a medium to de-contextualize and re- contextualize a piece of music and affect its expressive value by influencing its composition, lyrics, arrangement and sonic characteristics.

Each zone has dedicated contaminated bottles with touch sensors at the bottom which once triggered, initiate visual projection and soundscapes. The audience then interacts with photoresistors on the bottles by casting a shadow over the projection, altering the soundscapes of curated field recordings. This project embodies a form of situated listening that addresses topics of contaminated waterbodies and the effect they play on the environment. Water is used as a medium to conceptually portray flows of contamination, replicating those existing in the natural environment, and sound as a channel of narration, accompanied by video. The mediums connect with each other once interacted with via physical touch or shadow movement, letting the installation act as a means of situating the audience in an altering soundscape by participating in the narrative rather than being passive observers; a reflection on our co-existent relationship and active contribution to our surrounding environments. </p><p>Author provided keywords: Water Contamination Soundscape Sound Installation Interaction Sensors Environment Field-Recording</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e86a59682db4e3b1c0a69ec974be9761" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bognar, Lili Janka. <emph render="italic">"Past, Present, Palimpsest: Hungarian Folk Music's Performance Evolution"</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0046</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_6d1f96b5666204950936c172bfef04bc" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_6d1f96b5666204950936c172bfef04bc" type="Folder">2021-0046</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_35db51c92ee471186ff8e0bb24767746"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This Capstone Project occupies the domain of practice research, in that its key questions are posed through an engagement and intermingling of my own practice, others' practice/s, and the supporting musicological and philosophical literature. My key area of problematicity is concerned with notions of authenticity in Hungarian folk music, and especially folk music involving vocal performance. It considers folk music as an evolving tradition that is not restricted by a modern-day understanding of geographical borders; time period; or performance practice. Such a conception challenges the notion of folk music as a 'fixed', 'pure', and 'authentic' form of music, and consequently a static performance practice; a perception that is still surprisingly commonly held by some scholars, performers, and audiences in parts of Hungarian society today. My Capstone work aims to draw from the past by previewing the future, placing folk songs in a perpetual present that is constantly adapting, influencing, and being influenced.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Traditional Hungarian folk music, authenticity, evolution</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_40c7691cfe1636d592ad001f3aa4d55f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ciocca, Vera Renjifo. <emph render="italic">Towards a sustainable career as a post-millennial singer/songwriter: A Step-by-Step Guide to Independence in the Music Business</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0049</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_09ad05756310b5480912ba4eeea380e1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_09ad05756310b5480912ba4eeea380e1" type="Folder">2021-0049</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ff5ec1566c6b170fa399e3fd448cfbac"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Success in the music industry is not the same as it was a few generations ago. Building a career as an independent artist is changing with shifting expectations from all the stakeholders in the music business. Additionally, the emergence of multimedia, streaming platforms, and blockchain technologies, create more complex environments for emerging artists to navigate. In this study, I present a roadmap that will facilitate the process of releasing music for post-millennial independent sing/songwriters with consideration for all new variables in the market. In developing this roadmap, I analyze recent developments in the most important domains that an independent singer/songwriter needs to know about. These domains include (i) legal frameworks in the music business, (ii) marketing and distribution strategies, and (iii) monetization in the music business. I also analyze my experience in composing, producing, and releasing two songs in the form of contributions to this work to demonstrate where important domains overlay in practice. My goal, through this step-by-step guide, is to support emerging artists starting from zero to promote their music independently and who want to develop a sustainable career in Pop music.</p><p>Author provided keywords: DIY; Independent singer/songwriter; Contracts; PROs; Master/Composition; Record Label</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c74b8428f816a371f48b0d64c737397b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cruz, Mateo. <emph render="italic">Thoughtcrimes: Investigating the Creative Process Through a Self-Study</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0047</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_9c9ade41a9c5f150a80bdd383e2e763d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9c9ade41a9c5f150a80bdd383e2e763d" type="Folder">2021-0047</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ea4f5af53c4902f5ae8018619d6ee766"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This capstone project is a practice-based research that explores the creative process through the composing of a music piece for string quartet.

However, many prominent philosophers have often punted on giving a concrete theory of what 'admissible' means, often leaving it a primitive term and at best associating it with 'appropriate' or 'correct'. I suggest two alternative theories for defining 'admissible', which overcome some of the problems that primitive concepts of it encounter, such as higher-order vagueness and inaccessibility of meaning facts. I finally compare these alternative theories, a polling view and a core traits view of 'admissible', with the primitive conceptions to show that it is worth exploring more concrete theories of admissibility in order to improve supervaluationism.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Admissibility</subject><subject source="local">Supervaluationism</subject><subject source="local">Vagueness</subject><subject source="lcsh">Vagueness (Philosophy)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref432_rr5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Arseculeratne, Anishka. <emph render="italic">Examining Appiah's Identity and Cosmopolitanism</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0001</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="7983" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">7983</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_84e8586a1e3164ebabd8179129083bfa">In his book Ethics of Identity, Appiah explores the messy territory of the relation among identity, individuality, and ethics. His exploration begins with his view of the nature of the self and leads to his view about the obligations that individuals have toward others, which he calls Rooted Cosmopolitanism. Appiah's work draws upon liberal and communitarian ideas which have been in tension since the inception of the liberal-communitarian debate in the 1980s. In each case, Appiah deliberately places himself in the middle ground between liberal and communitarian ideas. In this paper I aim to systematise both Appiah's view of the self and his Rooted Cosmopolitanism, and examine the relation between the two views. I will then locate each view on the spectrum of ideas between those of the hardline liberal and the hardline communitarian to determine whether or not his view is coherent and truly original.</abstract><container id="aspace_58ae9bf9d18119e12f085957fa21a40a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_58ae9bf9d18119e12f085957fa21a40a" type="Folder">2016-0001</container></did><controlaccess><subject source="local">ethics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Identity</subject><subject source="local">liberalism</subject><subject source="local">communitarianism</subject><subject source="local">cosmopolitanism</subject><subject source="local">rooted cosmopolitanism</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref423_sxg" level="file"><did><unittitle>Leb, Benjamin Jared. <emph render="italic">Reasoning About Promises</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0002</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="7974" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">7974</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_944a7b2e85ad9edbcefba94fbea96faf">In his recent book, Shaping the Normative Landscape, David Owens presents a view on the value and function of obligation.

My capstone is a close reading of Galen Strawson's take on Locke, questioning whether it makes sense to think of Locke's account of personal identity primarily in terms of moral responsibility.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6bf1b0d006e65a7efaf073e7e812e439" level="file"><did><unittitle>Baho, May. <emph render="italic">Twins, Tigers, and Refrigerators: On Prescientific Kind Terms</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0041</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_39e1f462530a07b3b19c30002d59ef9a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_39e1f462530a07b3b19c30002d59ef9a" type="Folder">2019-0041</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3a798ccb4799cf2045ccee77247cb31f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This capstone argues the ways in which natural kind terms in the philosophy of language designate to their respective kinds.

Depersonalization, a phenomenon which entails feeling estranged from how we normally experience ourselves, is typically understood as a mental disorder; as harmful, disruptive, and negative. However, a central motivation in Buddhist philosophy is to demonstrate the illusory nature of the self, and to rid ourselves of its grip through certain practices. Consequently, my project analyzes the differences between depersonalization and the Buddhist practices, backing each up with neuroscientific data when possible, to explain how each bears on our experience of ourselves as selves. Additionally, I weigh both accounts against philosophical criteria of what constitutes a mental disorder, drawing conclusions which separate depersonalization and Buddhist practices both in terms of the underlying processes, and the normativity behind each experience.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e81d2cfbd906596093e4f1c006d19133" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chapman, Taj. <emph render="italic">Mind Your Language: A Philosophical Investigation into Objectivity in Journalism</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0170</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_3ec38dfa578faf8e3507ad366ec92f14" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3ec38dfa578faf8e3507ad366ec92f14" type="Folder">2019-0170</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_de688544082232b3b5f25a3b5b94170e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Despite the notion that objectivity is used to combat bias, this paper argues that appealing to objectivity is far more difficult.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d2481ab29bd3bc96082c74c216f491cd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Du, Xiaoxiao. <emph render="italic">Debunking Evaluative Realism</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0011</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_c9ff7c344b0984bc3a86a8cc01443828" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c9ff7c344b0984bc3a86a8cc01443828" type="Folder">2019-0011</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_aeae0decc738ae5771dd2955aba6fb2a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>I examine several versions of the debunking arguments of evaluative realism.

Considering that the Qur'an provides a minimal amount of information on the specifics of paying and receiv- ing zakat, Muslims had to rely on theological and ethical interpretations. Inevitably authors had disagreed not only on the specifics of the zakat tradition but also on the reasons and frameworks backing the Islamic pillar. Thus, this paper presents three frameworks of zakat in detail: Al-Ghaz- ali's Mysteries of Almsgiving, Al-Qaradawi's Fiqh al-Zakah, and Maliki's Al-Muwatta. To prove the significant disparity between these frameworks, each of them is compared to a different west- ern normative ethical perspective: virtue ethics, consequentialism, and deontology(respectively).   Furthermore, these frameworks are situated into their Islamic historical background, to portray the history of each specific ethical tradition within its context. Conclusively, I present the varying ethical justifications of the different frameworks Muslims need, for the application of the specific methodology of paying zakat. Overall, this paper contends that each of the authors had a significant personal influence on the interpretations.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c6c25d715574e7e752615fcdaf9b13e1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Huang, Alice. <emph render="italic">What We Talk About When We Talk About Structure</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0044</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_f4afaeff295b5d1e825432534b85476b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f4afaeff295b5d1e825432534b85476b" type="Folder">2019-0044</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1b0255a609618e6fc0b0643b3318ae59"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this paper I examine what the notion of "structure" should amount to in the context of the mind-body debate.

This paper aims to present a comprehensive account of the philosophical discussions on the role of causal dependence in counterfactual analysis, argue for the significance of causal considerations in both deterministic and indeterministic worlds and shed light on some problems with incorporating these causal considerations in the semantics. I present counterexamples to Lewis's standard semantics and discuss how these counterexamples suggest a need for invoking causal independence. I reject the premise—that Morgenbesser counterfactuals are true—based on which Schaffer and Edgington claim that Morgenbesser cases pose a problem for the standard semantics in the first place. I argue that when the indeterministic nature of Morgenbesser cases is accounted for, the counterfactuals comes out to be false. However, I contend that considerations of causal dependence are nevertheless significant in counterfactual analysis for both deterministic and indeterministic scenarios. In the end, I argue that the degree to which one event causally depends on another factors into whether the counterfactual in question is evaluated as true or false. Therefore, notions of causal relevance in the current causal independence approach need to be fine-grained.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_88ed425d0de346e5081b57a875b844b5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chiu, Emma. <emph render="italic">Weighing Property Rights: The Cabin and The Mosque</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0036</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_e385b48dbaa732ce2bbcb81aae88ef15" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e385b48dbaa732ce2bbcb81aae88ef15" type="Folder">2020-0036</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bacfed48c99d8a50d105f4f8d181daa6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This capstone weighs the moral and prudential weight of property rights with other rights, when conflicts of rights arise.

On the other hand, the adequacy view tells us that resources should be distributed to ensure every individual reaches a certain threshold.

This negative connotation of the word influences our perception of it: when we use the word "indoctrination," it is almost certain that we are not describing any admirable goal of education, but a kind of "bad" education. This project investigates various philosophical accounts that describe worrying cases of indoctrination. This thesis concludes that a successful philosophical theory of indoctrination has two components. The first step consists of either the intentions-based view or the outcome-based view which evaluates the relationship between the indoctrinator and the indoctrinated individual. The second step, the system-based view, lifts some, if not all, of the moral responsibility of indoctrination off the teacher's shoulders. I argue that the decision between the intentions-based view and the outcome-based view does not rest upon the details of the two theories, but a broader decision one has to make regarding whether indoctrination is a kind of morally wrong action type or state of affairs. </p><p>Author provided keywords: Indoctrination, Applied Ethics, Philosophy of Education</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_50ea1d50b0b2d53daca898f251b107a8" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Theater</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref29_r5g" level="file"><did><unittitle>Carrasco Valdich, Claudia Patricia. <emph render="italic">Directing Dinamene: Creating Impactful &amp; Accessible Theater</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0015</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="85" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">85</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_f03a115e79e0fb35676a02e62fcc5999" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f03a115e79e0fb35676a02e62fcc5999" type="Folder">2014-0015</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_56b231bc5314961c947364bb64b4066d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Theater, Biology<lb/>Abstract:Directed the play, "Dinamene, or the Light Indestructible," which follows the mental and emotional destruction of poet Luís de Camões in the aftermath of a shipwreck in which he let his lover die to save his unfinished manuscript.

These three projects form one piece, moving between the streets, the theater, and the written word.</p><p>All together, it's called ""( _______ ); Missing.""</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Theater</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Relationships, Interpersonal</subject><subject source="lcsh">Performing Arts</subject><subject source="lcsh">Goodbyes</subject><subject source="lcsh">Memory</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref318_m7e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Fowler, Brooks. <emph render="italic">FEMME</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0003</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3381" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3381</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_c751c2aee5c4d69653dba55d1ff34ab9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c751c2aee5c4d69653dba55d1ff34ab9" type="Folder">2015-0003</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e14c9c21ceedbee914b9278bea8f5d1e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Theater<lb/>Abstract: This paper is aimed at unpacking the developmental process of FEMME, a devised performance piece about the collisions of masculinity and femininity, in relation to the proposition that a loom can stand analogous to a cross. The dramaturgical and dilated structure of the piece is that of a queered crucifixion, and the central question is: will masculinity be transformed, cemented, or removed from the space when it comes into conflict with the femme? This paper traces the personal origins of the piece emerging from my grandfather's death, rediscovery of a Lutheran faith, and questions around the ethics of trans masculinity; the theoretical background of a horizontal process and my challenges with putting that theory into practice in terms of collaboration and design; and reflection on how this work fits into my growth as an art maker.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Devised</subject><subject source="lcsh">Masculinity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Femininity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Performing Arts</subject><subject source="lcsh">Theater</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref326_ruo" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kiyimba-Kisaka, Sanyu. <emph render="italic">Yénze</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0021</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3385" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3385</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_18963647da4125aff597ee91d2400926" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_18963647da4125aff597ee91d2400926" type="Folder">2015-0021</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_19b707382cb08f2d3c59deddaa08780d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Theater<lb/>Abstract: "The "Yenźe Project" is a choreopoem that juxtaposes my childhood poetry against my current poetry.

Abstract: Through the use of stand-up comedy, the central character J.S attempts to manage the somatic effects of a past trauma originating from rape. This play, which meshes recorded poetry interspersed with live stand-up comedy, provides a gateway to the voice and a method of confrontation. It pulls apart the conventions of silence and suppression that surround the narrative of trauma and puts the traumatic body on display. It disallows the trauma the permission to govern the narrative; stand-up comedy becomes J.S's language to tell her own story of the trauma.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Trauma</subject><subject source="lcsh">Rape</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Stand-up comedy</genreform><genreform source="lcsh">Comedy</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Performing Arts</subject><genreform source="lcsh">Poetry</genreform><subject source="lcsh">Sex</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref337_hi5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Vela Giraldo, Valentina. <emph render="italic">Nubia; a performance about my grandmother</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0023</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3391" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3391</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_b304b72bb396ad5f419d52e856dc997d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b304b72bb396ad5f419d52e856dc997d" type="Folder">2015-0023</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_297fba84f63932d382bbf922f3689088"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Abstract: This project dissects my return to the womb; it is the culmination of my research project in Cali, Colombia. I travelled to my mother's homeland in search of everything that hurt me in being attached to it. I looked for the pain in my mother tongue, in family memories, and in the grave of my grandmother. But instead of pain, I found peace. Nubia; a performance about my grandmother weaves together the original pain that still haunts me with the peace I discovered in my recent return to Colombia. This yoking together informs the environment, performance, and dramaturgical structure of the piece. In this way, my grandmother becomes the house, her death is manifested as a field of coffee beans, a memory of blood exists as earth, my birth lives in a sowing machine, time is a game of Parcheesi, and my mother's imagined death is my performance.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref430_1x9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al-Mahruqi, Noor. <emph render="italic">Bil3arabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0014</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="7981" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">7981</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_5609d6fe14297bcd273842440d5e8945">سجّل أنا عربي.

These sessions produce physical artifacts in the form of drawings which will be taken in conjunction with written reflections on the conversations had during the interaction to produce a study of the components that generate meaning within social interactions. The documentation of these sessions will be accompanied by a book of compiled research and images on the topics of social interaction, intimacy, and their artistic resonances.

Founded in 2017, Beirut Pride has been heralded as the first "Pride" in the Arab World. However, this raises the question what does "Pride" mean for Beirut and how does Beirut perform a "Pride"? In this paper, I argue that Beirut Pride has a dual effect of creating advocacy and safe spaces for Beiruti citizens while also reshaping Western narratives of the Middle East and Pride as a whole. By looking at Pride as a performance of queer visibility and community building both locally and in a larger global discourse, Beirut Pride calls into question the ways in which visibility is manifested while creating a physical space for the local community.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8260f77a27c2ac65a3dd4ecd5215a86a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Niko, Marika. <emph render="italic">memory is a partial victory over death</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0022</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e7179fe1d3b2ab88f18684aa87606fd6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e7179fe1d3b2ab88f18684aa87606fd6" type="Folder">2019-0022</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fc2e2cb34f287a72720b216cdf5a1a07"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>memory is a partial victory over death is a site-specific dance performance in the A5 Atrium that occurs over the course of sunset. Drawing upon the relationship between memory and materiality, the work invites the audience to witness two performers attempting to pursue, find, and ultimately reimagine each other's images on the window reflections that fade through time. The piece was inspired by how my grandmother, who has frequent memory loss, talks about her childhood memories. While I have an urge to materialize memories as a response to my fear of forgetting, the conversation with her allowed me to consider how memories can be remembered and worked on through immateriality. Facing the inevitable conditions of material disintegration, the two performers pay close attention to the urgency of the present as well as the repeated actions in order to archive memories.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_fa30c167354bf888ef087b67cf521a59" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sadarjoshi, Ankita. <emph render="italic">Civil</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0010</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_d4c996f2967d277e776a7ef3e75b1e61" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d4c996f2967d277e776a7ef3e75b1e61" type="Folder">2019-0010</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0fe6f41369861be8af354e6cc8e338ff"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Civil was a Theater capstone that took the shape of a publicly performed attempt at erasing handwritten phrases of violence inscribed on chairs.

This paper argues that the layout and designation of the Cartoucherie as a physical space intersects with and underlays the work of the Théâtre du Soleil to raise consciousness on social issues such as migration - asking how human beings should live together in a culturally diverse and global society. The static view of architecture as the permanent presence of structures is complicated by the utilization of space for theatrical purposes. Events that take place within theatrical spaces allow the structure, the architecture, to become a laboratory for modelling society and experimenting with creative forms of reality, especially so when these spaces double as contact zones for multicultural communities, who are themselves products of movements through space as is the case with the Cartoucherie.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_81a038f86794dee829539e23afe078a8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Szantho, Orsolya. <emph render="italic">nature(.c)ode</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0024</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_864c323f5d22c1fb9f6afbdb531ef33b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_864c323f5d22c1fb9f6afbdb531ef33b" type="Folder">2019-0024</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9dc79898a9bced786c06d54f139806f0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The interactive installation "nature(.c)ode" is a piece that invites the audience on a sensory journey to explore the possibility of organic coexistence between nature and technology. Structured around two large wooden structures, the installation offers the audience an opportunity to test how their responses to technology change when usual, synthetic surfaces of interaction are replaced by natural textures and organic materials. Designed as a ten-minute experience, the installation guides the audience in the space through its light design. As the lights continually shift, moving from the front to the back, shining on different sides of the two central structures at different times, the audience is invited to move through the space in a similar manner. The two cuboid-shaped central pieces, which serve as the interfaces of interaction, reflect a similar linear progression. By touching different wooden and plant attachments on these structures, the audience plays different tones, creating music together. While the front side of the first structure is covered in more technological tones, these gradually soften towards the back, where they are even accompanied by a light-interaction when the interaction occurs through plants.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d1dbe092a9be9a701b57b52e30aa0e6b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wilkes, Simon. <emph render="italic">Spectra</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0034</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_6bcd758a0d89c4bdd59ba6d4b21f721c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_6bcd758a0d89c4bdd59ba6d4b21f721c" type="Folder">2019-0034</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5df770cd34b93c289eb22fee5b8bdf45"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Spectra' is a comic book- play adapted from Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's Amazing Fantasy #15, the origin story of Marvel Comics' character, The Amazing Spider- Man.    Conceived as a 'comicbook- play,' 'Spectra' was developed through a series of rehearsal laboratories and writing workshops. Spectra explores playwrighting as a collaborative process and engages the visual form of comic books as a mode of playwrighting. In doing so, 'Spectra' experiments with ways of developing script, where text functions as an icon for language and image, as in the form of comic books.   'Spectra' explores the effects of internal and external violence upon the fractured psyche of a superhero seeking to reconcile the trauma of the past with their desire to wield power in the name of a greater good. By engaging with studies on feminism, tricksterism, transformative justice and queer theory, 'Spectra' seeks to question patriarchal notions of masculinity in order to redefine what it means to be a superhero.   'Spectra' seeks to reframe the vision of the superhero as the sole author of violence in the name of an absolute moral authority and proposea model for the superhero as existing within and accountable to a community of care.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_11ab94a46fe4ba8c2e48b197dc2e2d25" level="file"><did><unittitle>Arun, Archita. <emph render="italic">SAFAR| सफ़र</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0039</unitid><container id="aspace_acd7396593d4de5ad9f6850a2b0dd193" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_acd7396593d4de5ad9f6850a2b0dd193" type="Folder">2020-0039</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9d5d6a661f6d734e5984c17728f9c2f2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>SAFAR| सफ़र is a site-specific walk that investigates female sacrifice and performance of femininity across three generations of women in my family: paati→ amma and chiti→ me.

Considering the many experiments that have taken place in the art world over the past century, it seems that there is not yet a clear vocabulary for speaking clearly about audience participation. By drawing from both theoretical research and having carried out several practical art experiments, this paper proposes a new model for understanding participation based on five distinct aspects: Safety, Impact, Communication, Expressivity, and Agency. This capstone project also brings together lessons from the field of Game Design by exploring the ideas of Fun, Flow, Meaningful Play, Verbs, Objects and Systems. This capstone also consisted of a 2 hour long Game-Theater piece titled "Paperclips and Power". This piece is a post-apocalyptic nation-builder simulator where up to 30 audience members must find a way to survive in a world where the main resource is paperclips. The piece functions through several mechanics that create a system that allows for emergent stories to take place, allowing the audience to express their political views through the actions that they take during the piece.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

A single company operated both the West Virginia tunnel project and the Bhopal gas plant: Union Carbide. The performance was built out of documentary materials from Bhopal and a poetry collection entitled 'The Book of the Dead' by the poet Muriel Rukeyser which chronicles the West Virginia disaster. The project explores how the documents and poetry can be embodied, bringing to life the historical linkages between the tragedies, exploring and interrogating the corporate practices that allow these disasters to occur with minimal consequences. The capstone also explores how performance can be used as a medium to mobilise the voices of the dead in order to confront systems of oppression and participate in acts of collective healing.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Borrowing aesthetic imagery from Catholic performance practices and rituals, Novena depicts a recluse bride who isolates herself in a church to atone for her sins. In the piece, she attempts to reconcile her feelings of transgressional guilt in contention with her instinctual pleasures. This piece is devised from a combination of archival text from my journals, observational research conducted in Manila, Philippines, and anecdotal contributions from various women of color. Exploring the impact of religious structures on a woman's coming of age through prose, song, and dance, Novena dramatizes the process of interrogating and outgrowing institutional beliefs ingrained in the female psyche.</p><p>https://www.novena.space/archive</p><p>Author provided keywords:

The piece looks closely at how the practice exists today in the gulf by featuring the case of Hidaya Al Sultan and her Diya which is considered one of the highest ever collected in the history of the practice in the region. Hidaya, the Kuwaiti journalist was murdered in 1991 for writing an article about women of a certain tribe working as paid dancers. The piece argues that was makes this practice persist is that it provides a mechanism to distribute the responsibly and punishment of the crime on the society that allowed the murder to happen, and invites the audience to think about how this mechanism can be used in order to reduce potential violent acts.</p><p>Author provided keywords: virtual performance, Gulf, blood money, practice, journalist, punishment, murder</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_111da1100afc1bf28a3a6c56705da7a1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nair, Smrithi. <emph render="italic">pillowfort</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0053</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_89145e4961390c23cb9452c2c2b5d0ea" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_89145e4961390c23cb9452c2c2b5d0ea" type="Folder">2021-0053</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a0fc81387a8f0a21e0b46fe799418b08"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>pillowfort is an interactive theatrical project about radical care.

The forceful displacement of people due to warfare, natural disasters or even persecution presents a pressing need for immediate housing solutions. Presently available rapid deployable structures are part of the solution to this problem. Even so, due to the limited resources that refugees have at hand, these structures are either too expensive or do not meet the pressing needs of the issue. For this reason the scope of this project is the design of an economical rapid deployable structure in an attempt to provide a fast response to refugee situations.<lb/><lb/>The present report documents the design process towards the final proposed structure. For the scope of this report an economical rapid deployable structure is a sub-division of structural systems characterized by the ability to be assembled, dissembled and transported to a different site without losing its functional and structural characteristics. Additionally the design must remaining cost efficient.<lb/><lb/>The present document explores different techniques of design, as well as a variety of materials. The design process continues with geometrical and material optimization through an iterative approach. Numerous trials in computer aided design software are shown in the optimization process as well as empirical testing of the cross section.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_7c53e68bf3406cea6710a03ab3854a55"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Civil Engineering<lb/>Abstract: David Consales. Refugee situations call for immediate housing needs. With the numbers of refugees rising worldwide aid organizations have limited resources to assist efficiently and uniformly. Given that the problems behind the displacement of people are difficult to tackle, economical rapid deployable structures are a necessity. For this reason this project goes through the design process of such structure from conception to the manufacturing of a live scale prototype. The final design was evaluated against several criteria including structural stability, cost, transportability, portability, ease and speed of deployment and of collapse, protection from the environment and aesthetics. Additionally the proposed solution effectively solves problems such as overcrowding providing comfortable housing. The shape allows for modular, close packing in a macro scale. This allows concentration of structures without overcrowding the living space. The structural framework is designed of aluminum with a resistant and light cross section providing durability, strength and making the structure light. Additionally the material can be reutilized for other structures as a recycled, modular component. The textile exterior is designed of Polycotton canvas making it cool and waterproof. The proposed solution has efficiently met most of the set benchmarks with a structurally stable, low-cost, rapid deployable structure.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Design</subject><subject source="lcsh">Structural stability</subject><subject source="lcsh">Civil Engineering</subject><subject source="lcsh">Cost effectiveness</subject><subject source="lcsh">Sustainability</subject><subject source="lcsh">Construction</subject><subject source="lcsh">Refugees</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref40_e9b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yang, Songyishu. <emph render="italic">Design for Sustainable Urban Agriculture in Abu Dhabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0037</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="96" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">96</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_88af99ee7c5d47e3e45db940fadefe13" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_88af99ee7c5d47e3e45db940fadefe13" type="Folder">2014-0037</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e855303a0c841121f3741a4eddb68fac"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Civil Engineering<lb/>Abstract: In an age of booming population and rapid urbanization, the lack of agricultural labor, shortage of arable land, and the increasing dominance of large food corporations all pose great challenges on the sustainability of urban food system. Urban agriculture might be a potential solution to these challenges. Farming in urban areas addresses at least three critical issues facing urban food infrastructure: food security, food quality and energy use as represented by food miles. Additionally, urban farming is socially beneficial in terms of ecological health, community development, and food awareness. In current practice, however, urban agriculture lacks three crucial building blocks: 1. Empirical economic studies to prove its economic viability (Glaeser). 2. Scalable business model to attract potential stakeholders from both public and private sectors. 3. Engineering smart and innovative farms that are adaptive to urban setting. This project is offers a design for a well engineered urban farms that are adaptive to the conditions and constraints of cities. Innovative water management, structural, environmental and traffic systems that are compatible with existing standards of safety and comfort, are proposed. The design allows a cost that will be competitive in the marketplace and acceptable to government.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Hydroponics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Civil Engineering</subject><subject source="lcsh">Traffic</subject><subject source="lcsh">Food</subject><subject source="lcsh">Water</subject><subject source="lcsh">Agriculture/Farms</subject><subject source="lcsh">Energy</subject><subject source="lcsh">Urban agriculture</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref361_guq" level="file"><did><unittitle>Andargie, Maendot Solomon, and Mingzhu Hou. <emph render="italic">Rapid Replacement Bridge Design</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0027</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3403" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3403</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_827c4ce4937a63856841817e9ec2eaae" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_827c4ce4937a63856841817e9ec2eaae" type="Folder">2015-0027</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_70af03ea0121fa0eb86477d2f7d671d6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Civil Engineering<lb/>Abstract, Maedot Andargie: We are designing a rapid replacement bridge located in Upstate New York.

This, alongside with a number of environmental concerns over the traditional construction practices, calls for an active investigation in new and innovative ways of designing structures. This project aims to design a modern educational building that is both cost-efficient and environmentally friendly. The proposed design integrates innovative materials and advanced building Science concepts and techniques that ensure a sustainable and efficient design. An well-planned design allows for the seamless integration of elements that allow light and natural air circulation as well as a comfortable interaction with the surrounding environment landscape. Thus, comfortable study conditions for the occupants are met while boosting the  building performance and minimizing its carbon footprint. With this in mind, the project aims to explore the use of EPS beads in ultra-lightweight concrete composite as the theoretical analysis suggests better thermal performance of the building.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_160823f53cd47ed80bb6f2e6966f71e8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Khan, Waqar Younas, and Abdur (Mani) Rehman. <emph render="italic">Room Design for Effective Evacuation under Escape Panic</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0058</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e736f321f8ac3ea13f81bc533e0679b5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e736f321f8ac3ea13f81bc533e0679b5" type="Folder">2019-0058</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d1c8bbe464de08deb42299cb743421e7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The standards of evacuation design have not changed much in the past half a century. Any progress that is being made is so insignificant in value that the adoption of the ideas globally is not a priority. The 21st century is about minute detail optimization to achieve maximum efficiency. It is this search that is explained in the capstone where we try and understand the details and try to morph obstacles so as to help us achieve designs that lead to the goals we have set. In order to do this, inspiration from Dirk Helbing's work from 2001 was taken that discusses the possibility of improving evacuation rates by introducing obstacles in the pathway of an exit. The project delves further into this concept by trying to employ one or all of the following; deep neural networks, reinforced learning, and VISSIM. Based on the results obtained by Helbing, we expect that there is a certain design of obstacles that can improve the flow of pedestrians in an emergency evacuation. To answer this question, our research found that introducing funnel-shaped exits with a central kite-shaped obstacle produce the most efficient room design for evacuation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_81605de957012aff56e61d167d8f1e4e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Okoth, Victor, Raitis Pekuss, and Ylber Roka. <emph render="italic">Analysis of PWPB Algorithm for Incremental CAV Market Penetration Rates</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0048</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_3c28545440c309bb19abb2cc3fe6c1af" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3c28545440c309bb19abb2cc3fe6c1af" type="Folder">2019-0048</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dd0def57b425212338a550cb0a305afe"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Connected and Autonomous Vehicles are widely expected to revolutionize urban transportation. Their increased presence is expected to mitigate traffic congestions, environmental hazards presented by vehicles, reduce the number of accidents while also increasing the throughput of traffic networks. However, these benefits will become apparent gradually corresponding to the gradual market penetration rates of CAVs. This paper studies traffic intersection control of mixed vehicle traffic that consists of CAVs as well as human driven vehicles. Specifically, we analyze the Position Back Pressure algorithm which is studied to outperform SCOOT - a widely accepted real-time adaptive traffic control method - in terms of delays for both low and high demand traffic conditions. We address the underlying assumption in the algorithm that all the information about vehicles in the network is known. Such a scenario is only possible with a 100% market penetration of CAVs and, therefore, does not reflect the real life conditions. To address this we vary the amount of known and, consequently, estimated data, which is then fed into the traffic simulation.

With increasing environmental concerns, assessing the external cost of all transportation modes on the environment is important. In this paper, a cost function was created that takes into account the agency and user costs as well as the environmental impacts of the transportation system. Through use of covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, a methodology for the design of public transit networks that minimizes this cost was created and implemented using SUMO(Version 1.3.1; Institute of Transportation Systems, 2018) to reflect traffic scenarios that were input to the cost function for 5 routes and a headway of 10 minutes. When the optimization was initiated with random stops, a minimum value of $3,418,128 was found. When the optimization was started with sequential stops, a minimum value of $1,087,693 was found. Both are higher than the benchmark solution of $734,395. Since this methodology did not find a solution more optimal than analytical methods, further research on the applicability of CMA-ES to transit design is needed.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Waste-to-energy technologies provide the necessary tools to redefine waste as a raw material or resource, that plays a crucial role in the development of a circular waste economy. Currently, landfilling is the most widely practiced waste management strategy which has a large and wide range of environmental impacts. This project proposes a sustainable WTE facility design with MIPG as its core technology to convert MSW into energy and slag. The circular economy created through the facility mimics that of the environment in which resources discarded by one organism are used by another organism. The proposed solution can be retrofitted on top of existing waste management or WTE systems. The design aims to transform waste management into a sustainable and ecologically friendly process. The target location selected for the plant is in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. The design of the WTE plant includes aspects of structure, transportation, and waste processing which are required to produce energy from waste. The design is further supported by an Environmental Impact Assessment that evaluates compliance of the plant with UAE rules and regulations.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Recent research has defined 3D printing as one of the fastest, most efficient and most cost-effective methods of building. 3D printing ensures quick repeatability of the construction process as well as lower labor costs since a machine now does the work. While this new technology has many advantages, it also poses a great risk to the environment due to the high use of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) in the 3D printing construction industry. Approximately 900 kg of CO2 are emitted for every production of 1 ton of cement. This makes up more than 8% of the man-made emissions of CO2, a potent greenhouse gas. This capstone project aims to find alternative sustainable solutions to OPC that would meet the 3D printing standards as defined by American Standard of Testing and Materials (ASTM) as well as the Portland Cement Association while also reducing the amount of CO2 emission required during production. Moreover, the project will involve 3D printing different prototypes using the proposed alternative cementitious materials and testing and optimizing the materials' strength, flow and microstructure.</p><p>Author provided keywords: 3D, Ordinary, Limeston, Calcinated Clay, Sustainable, Nanoclay</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b1f869ab41c63eb67fa78afe8d84408a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sohn, Sungmin. <emph render="italic">Designing Graphical Visualization of the Maximum Congestion Propagation Speed at the Network</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0062</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_cb272a642d77b45f0ef0485653e47f1f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_cb272a642d77b45f0ef0485653e47f1f" type="Folder">2021-0062</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d969533cbec555a9dd29fdb22229ca5e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) is a graphical representation that relates the weighted flow and density of the urban network. Among several uses of the MFD for network traffic analysis, this capstone project focuses on the slopes of the MFD's two branches. The left branch of the MFD represents the free-flow speed of the network while the right branch shows the speed at which the congestion propagates and/or dissipates in the network. Since the introduction of MFD, the main focus of the estimation methods of the MFD was on the left branch (free-flow speed). As a result, the right branch of the MFD representing the congestion propagation and/or dissipation speed in the network has not yet been fully comprehended. The understanding of the right branch of the MFD is important because the maximization of the dissipation speed at the network is desired to mitigate traffic congestion. Hence, my goal for this capstone is to design a graphical visualization tool that could show the relationship between the links and the network in terms of the congestion propagation speed.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram, Maximum Congestion Propagation Speed, Visualization, Traffic Network</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_4329056c35cee31dc6906c421ee36820" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Computer Engineering</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref373_s26" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alfergani, Noha H. <emph render="italic">Design of an Automatic Test Pattern Generation Tool for VLSI Transition Faults</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0030</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3409" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3409</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_df978f6da9d43188940695fb62dbafc5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_df978f6da9d43188940695fb62dbafc5" type="Folder">2015-0030</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_453218d4c9b665b0f2b30ba22679b555"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Computer Engineering<lb/>Abstract: Integrated circuits are extensively and universally utilized. Their applications vary from consumer products to mission critical electronics, creating a spectrum of susceptibility towards defects that accompany the manufacturing process. Thus, each electronic chip undergoes testing that determines whether the chip is defective or defect-free upon being manufactured. The testing process encompasses the application of carefully selected test patterns that produce an output which is observed and compared to an expected output. There are number of fault models that guide the testing process.  This project aims to create an Automatic Test Pattern Generation Tool, a software tool, targeting the transition delay fault model.  The test patterns generated by the software tool will then be used in the hardware component of the project. The test patterns will be applied to a desired circuit uploaded to an FPGA board to verify the output responses. The output will be verified by observing the output response to the expected output given the circuit under test.

We intend to develop a system that takes 3D objects and presents them in various robust analytical models. Specifically, the proposed framework seeks to develop a cohesive and consistent shape analysis pipeline system that can correctly identify and preserve the important features of shapes. These important shape features will be processed and modelled into shape correspondences for 3D shapes registration, shape descriptors to evaluate the geometric similarities between shapes for 3D shape retrieval, and a clustering paradigm for discerning parts for 3D shape segmentation. The overall shape analysis pipeline is intended to deliver a standard process for capturing 3D object information from different analytical perspectives for further field-specific interests, such as categorization, detection, and representation. These perspectives are based in one-to-one, one-to-all, and introspective object comparisons that provide deep yet generally important understanding of shape features, opening them to further studies in matching, relating, and labelling.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Computer engineering</subject><subject source="lcsh">Geometry</subject><subject source="local">3D</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_4fd4661476b9838084234962acad94ed" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alhosani, Hamdan Ahmed, and Hazem Ibrahim. <emph render="italic">SFLL-HD Logic Locking Framework</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0044</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_ffd7039132dc005706f40db8ee7b55d3">IC netlists are valuable assets by nature since it holds the basic design of electronic chips.

In the past, drone systems have employed many technologies to perform relative localization, including various motion detection systems. With the reduced cost of high-resolution cameras and increased computational capabilities of on-board computers, computer vision techniques are now being investigated as additive sensors to inertial measurement unit systems.  Several computer vision techniques employ fiducial markers with a recognizable pattern to perform pose estimation between the camera and the attached markers in the collaborating drones. This concept is used for relative drone localization while each drone performs SLAM using cameras, LiDAR and an IMU. In this project, a multi-sensor integration of a LiDAR sensor and a spherical-lens camera is used along with a wireless ad-hoc communication channel to assist in a collaborative control design for a drone swarm for visual aerial coverage purposes. Using simulations, a real-time Voronoi tessellation of the area in NYUAD's Robotics lab for two of the designed drones flying at the same height is also derived and the area coverage is achieved by commanding each drone to move towards the centroid of its assigned Region of Responsibility.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

In the first half of 2019, more than 3,800 publicly-disclosed data breaches in companies have been recorded, exposing 4.1 billion compromised records. This project serves to build a framework using a head-mounted display (HMD) to enable privacy-preserving applications by allowing the user to handle his or her unencrypted data without using digital communication. An application was developed in the HMD in which data transmission was carried out over the visual spectrum, using photons as information carriers to eliminate the need for digital connections.

Reaching a consensus is challenging if the system is dynamic and makes decisions in real time (such as in autonomous vehicles and mobile sensor networks). Consensus algorithms ensure that a cluster of devices can cooperatively complete its tasks even if the cluster loses its leader. However, when a consensus algorithm is built upon a typical hub spoke network topology, the algorithm may be rendered useless if the singular network access point fails. A mesh network is a non hierarchical topology for local networks where devices can directly communicate amongst themselves without a central node for coordination, making them resilient to a single point of failure. Our capstone project implements Raft, a distributed consensus algorithm, atop a mesh network for use in low power embedded systems. We developed an open source software library and prototyped it on a custom printed circuit board. Our compiled software library consumes 0.33MB of flash memory and is capable of supporting over 100 nodes. During elections, it takes an average of 300ms to elect a new leader with insignificant variation as the network size grows.</p><p>Author provided keywords: consensus, mesh, raft, embedded, IEEE 802.11, 42</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5e9ea5fa243f9e184dfa010ca833e60d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ghosheh, Ghadeer. <emph render="italic">Non-Contact ECG Monitoring System</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0065</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_66dd33a010535c0a9c099e3730eda68a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_66dd33a010535c0a9c099e3730eda68a" type="Folder">2021-0065</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c8d830e4ff2fe2e8e439f9a1f942a468"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have been proven to be amongst the most deadly diseases worldwide.

We aim to use EEG data collected from a previous study at the Applied Interactive Multimedia lab (AIMlab) to quantify haptic experience using EEG data and machine learning, in particular the haptic delay. Our final machine learning model achieves an accuracy of 83.2 ± 0.573% (reported within a 95% confidence level) in detection of a haptic delay in the user experience from a single trial EEG data stream using a light gradient boosting machine. Using EEG data to quantify haptic experience renders our model more accurate, and objective, which will have many applications in designing haptic electronics, attention rehabilitation, and neuroscience research.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Machine Learning, Neuro-Haptic, Neural Networks, EEG data, Brain</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d9de906123d8cde62694f554c05f116c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Orazgaliyeva, Anel. <emph render="italic">Visualization Tool for Traffic Data</emph> </unittitle><unitid>2021-0068</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_557b471a6f964b9278b7edbbf2632208" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_557b471a6f964b9278b7edbbf2632208" type="Folder">2021-0068</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7cee053e977aee2e7dc79aa6fda1da6a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>With more than 1.2 billion cars on the roads worldwide, traffic congestion is one of the biggest transportation problems in cities. Congestion has serious economic costs; for example, in the United States alone, the freight sector loses more than $74 billion annually due to congestion, and costs to individual drivers exceed $88 billion. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) produce large amounts of traffic data that can be used to monitor, assess, and improve the performance of those same transportation systems. Since generated data are largely abstract, unstructured, and high-dimensional, it is difficult for researchers to interpret and analyze them. Visualization tools can effectively represent data, reveal hidden patterns, and enable to combine human capabilities with machine intelligence in deducing new patterns. The product of this Capstone project is a novel easy-to-use, scalable visualization tool that preprocesses and organizes traffic data, aggregates them into selected levels of abstraction (links, nodes, or hexagon grid cells of variable size), and visualizes their properties in effective ways at user request.</p><p>Author provided keywords: visualization, traffic research</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_9229e2d049b7192de77416f109b6cbd0" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Electrical Engineering</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref43_bdx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aujeszky, Tamas. <emph render="italic">Design of Arabic Sign Language Interpreter Using Microsoft Kinect</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0039</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="99" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">99</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_9b1d649a9dc737e343bed4ca62f79bc7" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9b1d649a9dc737e343bed4ca62f79bc7" type="Folder">2014-0039</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_67ba938d9098bd7bf6c0a4702c380eac"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Electrical Engineering<lb/>Abstract: This final report is made for the Senior Capstone Design Project of New York University Abu Dhabi. It outlines a proposed solution to overcome a large part of the difficulties that hearing-impaired people face when they need to communicate. As a second benefit, the solution also facilitates education of sign-language. It also contains information related to the progress in implementing the solution.<lb/><lb/>Currently there are no affordable solutions on the market, and previous results are either lacking in quality or highly limited in usability. With the help of the next generation of hardware sensors, the proposed solution is aimed to greatly improve on these shortcomings while bearing an affordable price tag. In addition, the proposed solution is the first known of its kind that focuses on Arabic sign language, an area where current awareness is low and the room for improvement is vast.<lb/><lb/>The solution consists of an affordable hardware sensor available on the market and software algorithms designed in order to process the data acquired by the sensor. Together they set up a system that is robust, user-friendly and also possesses the potential for a wide reach through its low price point.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Hearing impairments</subject><subject source="lcsh">Disabilities</subject><subject source="lcsh">Communication</subject><subject source="lcsh">Sign language</subject><subject source="lcsh">Kinect (Programmable controller)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Electrical engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref441_xgd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abe, Yilkal. <emph render="italic">FPGA Based Network for Fast Microprocessor Simulation</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0026</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="7992" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">7992</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_8201947660145aa6abc9aa0eea550008">Simulation and verification are important stages in the manufacturing of modern day microprocessors.

Through the years, Virtual Reality (VR) simulators are becoming an essential part of modern dental education. Our project aims to design, develop, and evaluate a framework for simulating dentist-patient interaction using VR. Our project focuses on designing a three-dimensional model, through MakeHuman software, that is animated with different facial expressions, body movements, and vocal responses that can tell the dentist more about how the patient is feeling. The goal of our system is to present dental trainees with the basic communication skills and treatment acts that is required to deal with patients. The simulation we created is composed of three parts: pre-treatment, during treatment, and the post-treatment. There is a smooth transition between these scenarios, where the trainee is being tested on his or her dental performance accordingly. The dental simulation offers dentist-patient scenarios that include audio communication, visual communication, and an overall evaluation of the dentist's performance. The system was built on 3D Unity Game Engine, and was later tested on a group of dental students from the University of Sharjah (UOS), Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_99dc1f0056f296f4e61ab34c0f5fd28a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chirita, Daniel. <emph render="italic">Learning-Based Visual Tracking: Using PTZ Cameras to Track Commercial UAVs</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0062</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e806d13ef801a6b6a8567621f935e333" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e806d13ef801a6b6a8567621f935e333" type="Folder">2019-0062</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_29626a9df878ca4511d05184bd9ef3ff"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The goal of this capstone is to create a visual processing routine that detects and tracks airborne drones for security applications in airports, air bases, and other drone frequented locations.

The project aims to provide an integration of existing algorithms in each category to realize the outlined goal. Results suggest that the framework allows for efficient visual servoing. Unlike most visual servoing routines, the proposed mechanism can leverage object detection to expand re-detection capabilities.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_df3985dca040a623cab06cbe152fc62a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mehta, Pranav. <emph render="italic">Muon-Ra: A Cosmic Ray-based Quantum Random Number Generator</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0063</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_2befc335293a701c2c2de39b044d815d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_2befc335293a701c2c2de39b044d815d" type="Folder">2019-0065</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_25d7b2523869d05efbcec962281484d2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Muon decay is a natural phenomenon based on the collision of cosmic radiation with Earth's atmospheric particles. A Cosmic Ray Detector can be used to ionize muons striking the surface of the detector, thus conveying information about a given muon's position of hit, angle of hit and time interval between subsequent hits. Muon strikes are non-deterministic and the information they yield can be used as seeds to a True Random Number Detector (TRNG). In this work, a Quantum TRNG is proposed that translates position and angle of muon strikes into random numbers. Several designs are created and evaluated on the basis of the ability of the output to pass randomness tests and rate of throughput. The most robust design is incorporated as an online service that can be used to generate random numbers in real time.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d89a77c654ef3d4ad4144d6ee76447c2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gebremedhin, Ruth, Ken Iiyoshi and Mahrukh Tauseef. <emph render="italic">Design of a Haptic-Audio-Visual Tele-Dental Training Simulation</emph>

This has led to the emergence of haptic-based medical simulations that have numer- ous technical and ethical advantages in medical training. Since dental training is a highly haptic task, tactile internet has the potential to improve the current dental training techniques by allowing communication of motor skills as haptic media. This project designs and implements a detailed, virtual-reality based simulation of a peri- odontal procedure using haptic technology and a realistic 3D model of the oral cavity. A communication system that allows low-latency transmission of haptic and audio- visual data over a network was developed. The local-hosted communication network performed with minimal overhead; an average delay of 0.62 ms and jitter of 0.53 ms for haptic data, and round trip time of less than 30 ms for audio-visual data. This system enables effective supervised training over a physical distance and is more interactive than commonly used non-haptic computer simulations.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

The final model design will provide a better understanding of how pollutant flow information can supplement satellite imagery data to better identify sources of polluted discharge that impact mangrove health. The project tracks mangrove cover in the region using unsupervised classification on satellite imagery through color cluster analysis. identifies a trend line for seasonal variation in mangrove cover, thus allowing for deviations due to anthropogenic activities to be identified. A trend line with an error margin of 17.9% was calculated, therefore any decrease of mangrove cover greater than the critical point would be flagged, allowing the instance to be investigated further. The project stems from the lack of an appropriate tool that is able to quantify the effect that changes in the local environment can have on mangroves. The proposed tool is envisioned to help marine biologists, researchers, and governments understand where pollutants flow from and what path they take to impact mangrove health negatively.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

One of the major approaches towards tackling this formidable public health epidemic is by raising awareness and developing early-detection mechanisms so that people have enough time to preemptively tackle this health challenge. Our Capstone Design Project seeks to gather the physiological signals our body exhibits leading up to an AMI by using ECG and Pulse Oximetry sensors in a wearable armband and use machine learning analysis on the real-time collected data to provide personalized feedback to the user on their cardiovascular health and AMI risk condition. A printed circuit board (PCB) for the monitoring of cardiovascular parameters was designed and validated by EAGLE early-testing. Over 900,000 ECG, age, and sex samples obtained from the ECG-ViEW database have been used to train machine learning models, including naive bayes, logistic regression, CNN, and RNN, that predict the onset of AMI. High prediction accuracy of 90.5% (CNN) and 89.2% (RNN) have been achieved, demonstrating the promising application of early identification of AMI.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

The majority of deaths associated with CVDs occurs amongst patients who have never been previously diagnosed with any CVDs. Many CVDs, such as arrhythmia, manifest their symptoms a long time prior to the onset of any adverse or catastrophic event(s), and such the early detection of cardiac abnormalities is incredibly important. However, traditional ECG monitoring systems face challenges with respect to their scalability and affordability as they require direct contact with the body and cumbersome equipment. In this Capstone Design Project, we aim to provide a solution to this problem by developing a small-size, non-contact, real-time feedback, and long-term monitoring lead-I ECG system. It is paired with an iOS application that receives the data through Bluetooth Low Energy and utilizes real-time machine learning analysis. </p><p>Author provided keywords: ECG, Biopotential signal, PCB, ML, Device, Non-contact, electrocardiogram, cardiovascular diseases, electrodes, machine learning</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_490a06d1b509ac5f3bb85902a4ba5278" level="file"><did><unittitle>Elgamal, Mariam; Yeojin Jung, Mohammed Adib Oumer, and Farida Shaban. <emph render="italic">Indoor Acoustic Localization of Pests via IoT Technologies &amp; Machine Learning</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0064</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_9cf9df4e07e147d4f7ac9e6e06f25732" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9cf9df4e07e147d4f7ac9e6e06f25732" type="Folder">2021-0064</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_98314f159e2f40aad685572711180b29"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Museums are fighting a constant battle to preserve their invaluable specimens and artwork from pests that can potentially damage them, including the Louvre Abu Dhabi. This project aims to develop a sound detection and analysis system to detect, locate, and determine the population dynamics of crawling and flying pests (e.g., crickets), thereby allowing pest control strategies to be more targeted and efficient. By collecting such information about pests, museum facilities teams can target their use of pesticide to only the affected areas of the museum and hence reduce the total exposure of the museum collections to pesticides throughout the year. Additionally, the collected information could be used to identify trends in the population dynamics and aid in designing long-term non-chemical pest preventative strategies (i.e., traps, ultrasonic pest repellents). Our system utilizes a network of Internet of-Things (IoT) devices that would collect and process necessary real-time information on the cloud using signal processing, machine learning models and big data analysis methods to aid efficient pest-control plans. Ideally, the system will aid museum administrators in decision-making by providing real-time analysis and visualizations through a user interface on handheld devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and laptops. </p><p>Author provided keywords: Acoustic-Localization, IoT, Machine Learning, Localization, IoT, Machine Learning, Direction of Arrival, spectrograms, signal processing</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e719e71c42053ee14cf7dae59b4b0560" level="file"><did><unittitle>Garcia, Cristian; Rumail Memon and Ahmad Nasralla. <emph render="italic">Design of a non-invasive cell density monitoring device for bacterial batch cultures</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0060</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_c6f108fb272ee63ff1ba3e1fe5c6bbbe" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c6f108fb272ee63ff1ba3e1fe5c6bbbe" type="Folder">2021-0060</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cc03eb1fcae18f2090629c688b97a49a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The proposed system is a device that enables automated non-invasive monitoring of cell density within a biological lab incubator during experiment preparation.

It has been observed that the population bleeds out of urban centres into peri-urban regions which are located between urban settings and their immediate rural surroundings. These regions are relatively untouched in terms of urban planning, but well within the economic reach and influence of nearby cities therefore they present a great potential for the next generation of urbanisation. This project explores new perspectives that can be brought to the construction industry to aid a shift towards a much needed sustainable practice, with emphasis on the environmental aspect. The design presented here is informed by background research and experiential work in the Solar Decathlon house project, and case studies conducted in Abu Dhabi and Dubai to benchmark practices that can be improved on and adopted for future undertakings.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_9a56ee5500059606a6e5c99f0f07dee4" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Mechanical Engineering</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref41_a3s" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kun, Janos Csaba, and Mohammed Omar. <emph render="italic">Design of an Inkjet Generator for Metal Oxide Nanostructures</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0034</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="97" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">97</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_9d671ad2fb461b6621ad98085c14d361" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9d671ad2fb461b6621ad98085c14d361" type="Folder">2014-0034</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2ab71190739765c8df7177865ad096fa"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Mechanical Engineering<lb/>Abstract, Janos Kun: Our project aimed to create a cost-effective and simple nanostructure-production method based on an off-the-shelf inkjet printer cartridge.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_8808386d000fb5af96f326e1e1abcebd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Mechanical Engineering<lb/>Abstract, Mohammed Omar: This investigation deals with printing metal oxide nanostructures using inkjet technology as it is a much cheaper process than current processes of nanostructure synthesis. This is achieved by creating fine aerosol particles with an HP c6614 #20 inkjet cartridge and leveraging the so-called "coffee ring effect". Upon their deposition on a heated substrate, the aqueous droplets evaporate leaving behind porous nano-membranes. To be of any practical use, the inkjet aerosol generator had to create droplets on demand that have a diameter of less than 20μm, an initial velocity of 5m/s, a frequency of 1kHz and it should run for at least one hour continuously. Although, we fulfilled the first three specifications using the literature on our inkjet cartridge, the fourth was not. Our system however, finally synthesised ZnO porous nanomembranes which laid the foundation for future experimentation; our results were sufficient for our proof of concept. Future investigations would include studies on optimising the "throw distance" (defined as the distance from the inkjet nozzle to the substrate) to create the most useful nanostructures as well as creating a system that functions reliably for a practical time period.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Nanostructures</subject><subject source="lcsh">Aerosols</subject><subject source="lcsh">Ink-jet printing</subject><subject source="lcsh">Mechanical engineering</subject></controlaccess></c><c audience="internal" id="aspace_ref49_sg1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Saad, Ahmed Gamal. <emph render="italic">Design of a Microfluidic Dispensing Unit for C.

When a C.elegans worm passes through the channel and blocks the laser light to the photodiode, a change in light intensity is observed and that change is used to detect the passage of the worm.

To more accurately characterize biological systems, researchers must turn to static environments, which yield lower noise in quantitative phenotyping. A primary tool for culturing cells in a static environment is continuous culture, where inoculated growth medium is continually diluted with fresh medium. Turbidostats are powerful characterization tools that provide static culture environments; however, they are often expensive, especially when purchased in custom configurations, and are difficult to design and construct in a lab. Eight culture chambers are controlled simultaneously with the proposed configuration, and all components are readily available from various sources. We demonstrate that our continuous culture device can be used under different modes, and can easily be programmed to behave either as a turbidostat or fluorostat. Addition of fresh medium to the culture vessel is to be controlled by a real-time feedback loop or simply calibrated to deliver a defined volume. The project aims to build a device which is both cheaper and less laborious in comparison to the already existing commercial versions.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f23a21a570eb7742bb54a074f886b969" level="file"><did><unittitle>Castillo, Alberto, Pratik Maisuria, and Mahmoud Soliman. <emph render="italic">Reconstructing the Horologium of Harun Al-Rashid</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0066</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_3382292bc2100e2622d3a809d95e257a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3382292bc2100e2622d3a809d95e257a" type="Folder">2019-0066</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d8cbc0ed9835aec5a2e22e52c1eb372d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The following report details the reconstruction of the horologium of Harun al-Rashid from an engineering perspective.

It aids in food security by pro- viding control over all environmental factors, the preservation of endangered species of plants and the conservation of resources such as arable land and water. It is based on the finding that plants are best able to absorb particulate nutrients in a distance range of 1 to 50 micrometers (μm). Therefore, roots of the plants that are suspended within enclosed nutrient rich systems can better absorb and assimilate the minerals for more efficient farming with minimal water usage. Out of all available mineral nutrients, potassium ion (K+) plays particularly crucial role in plant growth and metabolism, and it is also the most abundant cation in plants.   The project aims to develop a micro scale sensor that monitors the real time uptake of K+ via roots that are directly exposed to the nutrient solution. The data collected can be further used to optimize the amount of nutrients needed by plant thus minimizing nutrient waste and producing crops of higher nutritional value.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_87fe018c7e858ff73ee9a5f0448cb51a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kasahara, Shunsuke. <emph render="italic">Design of a Bio-inspired Lizard Robot Mimicking Tail Autotomy Process</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0053</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_b814566a8a511374157dd59376c73ae1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b814566a8a511374157dd59376c73ae1" type="Folder">2019-0053</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e4e05e5667cc7259b67cebc7262af56f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Caudal autotomy is widespread among lizards: around 13 out of 20 families show this reflex severance strategy of their tails as a self-defence mechanism either to escape the predator's grasp or in anticipation of any life-threatening situation. The detached tail continues to wiggle (may go up to 30 minutes) through anaerobic metabolism and attracts the attention of the predator, which ultimately gives time to the lizard escape the ambush site. The mechanism of autotomy still remains secret. To explain this sheer bizarre phenomenon, we have developed a mechanistic model. Bio-inspired by the microstructures found on the broken tail surfaces, a bio-interlocking model containing an array of hemispherical microstructures was proposed. To test the model, a lab test setup was built and experiments on the biomimetic tail part were performed for its characterization. Finally, to demonstrate the actuatable interlock mechanism, a lizard robot was designed and fabricated.

Cancer metastasis accounts for about 90% cancer deaths, hence understanding the mechanical attributes of cancer cells will allow for better development of inhibition techniques to curb the cancer growth. The capstone project aimed at developing a mechanical stretching device that works with applied air pressure to study the effect of different stresses on breast cancer cells. Several stretching devices have been designed and implemented to study functional responses of various cells by inducing elastic deformations (tensile, compressive, or shear) on cells. However, these devices, despite being very compatible with advanced microscopy techniques, offer many limitations. Therefore the project's main goal was to resolve the current devices drawbacks. The main steps included eliminating the insufficient clamping mechanism, the inconsistency in the periodicity of the strains applied to the cells, the non-uniformity of the strain distributions over the membrane surface, and the inapplicability of running multiple membranes at once.</p><p>Abstract: Gladys Mwedzi:
Studying the effect of mechanical forces on the migratory and biological responses of cancer cells is of interest to several fields including drug delivery and metastasis. Several stretching devices have been designed and implemented to study functional responses of various cells by inducing elastic deformations on them. However, despite being helpful in our current understand of cellular mechanobiology, they entail various limitations. This senior undergraduate capstone project aims to develop a custommade stretching device that fits in an incubator as well as on a microscope stage, yet offers various stretching scenarios during the same experiment. Our device constitutes a PDMS chip with multiple wells of different shapes including circular, square, rectangular, and oval. A thin PDMS membrane covers the wells-chip and stretches upon pressurizing the wells. Our study considered optimizing the wells' sizes and shapes, and results show that the membrane stretches differently corresponding to each well geometry. Therefore, cancer cells seeded on the PDMS membrane can experience different stretching magnitudes, directions, and distributions, within the same setup and during the same experiment. Next steps include building and testing the biochip, followed by studying the response of cancer cells under these different multiaxial stretching scenarios.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Local wave conditions include an average wave height of 0.5 m at depths of 21-30 m in the Gulf region. In the unit, a round buoy extracts kinetic energy from the heaving motions of the ocean waves and drives a submerged positive displacement pump to pressurize seawater through the reverse osmosis membrane in the desalination process. The desalinated permeate is transferred into a reservoir on shore, while the high concentrated brine is discharged to the ocean. Using the "Delbuoy" desalination unit as a benchmark, a more efficient system is developed by implementing bistable springs to create a nonlinear stiffness system. This system is able to reach resonance with incoming seawaves at different natural frequencies, therefore archives a higher permeate production of 0.252 m^3 /s. The design skips the intermediate step of the electromechanical conversion process, therefore utilizes no generators or motors, which offers advantages such as reduced cost, simplicity in the design and installation process, and increased power efficiency.</p><p>Author provided keywords: bistable desalination, autonomous wave powered, reverse osmosis, nonlinear stiffness buoy</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_29f4082f4c23d62b723f595b74b2daaf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alshurafa, Qamar. <emph render="italic">3D Printed Water Purification Filter Based on Paper Lateral Flow</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0057</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_df2ead19888e92e04677f45cf139b190" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_df2ead19888e92e04677f45cf139b190" type="Folder">2021-0057</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c44b688821dbff41b7d2bd128b6ab1d1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This project develops a novel 3D printed water purification filter that works based on water lateral flow within a single paper sheet.

The goal is to be able to provide accessible purified water utilizing a simple device. This would be brought to areas where clean decontaminated water isn't readily available, as well as where there is a demand to remove undesirable chemicals and biological contaminants from water. The device will still similarly utilize a paper platform as the core for water purification, thus tackling the issue of paper recycling, among the addition of new materials such as charcoal. This filter design is completely new, utilizes only a single sheet of paper, and solves water leakage problems with a clean-cut route. In total, the new filter will be executed in a way that reduces technical past issues faced such as paper stacking, water leakage, and purification throughput as well as allowing for efficiency in purifying water.</p><p>Author provided keywords: 3D Purification Water Bacteria Paper Later Flow Efficiency</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5f289863ac8c5762520b9b15bb1f0511" level="file"><did><unittitle>Baho, Ingie. <emph render="italic">Fabrication and Control of Robotic Laparoscopic System</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0063</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_0548f35f7e07dd45d6496fd908cbcbe7" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0548f35f7e07dd45d6496fd908cbcbe7" type="Folder">2021-0063</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ea3055ebeaee312d8b514d2c1521daab"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Robot-assisted surgery can address limitations of minimally invasive surgical operations and to further enhance confidence and precision of physicians conducting open surgery.

These blockers are both extremely heavy (accounting for 30% of the nacelle weight) and contribute to fuel inefficiency. In a study conducted by the General Electric Aircraft Engines company, it was estimated that the specific fuel consumption can increase by ~0.5-1.0% due to the use of mechanical blockers. This is even more significant as thrust reversal systems are only utilized for a tiny fraction of a plane's operating time. According to the Boeing Company, running thrust reverser systems on a Boeing 767 can cost about USD $125,000 per airplane annually, vastly outweighing the financial savings from reduced brake wear. Depending on the airline and routes flown, this can account for almost 0.5% of the annual operating costs of a B-767. Previous capstone projects have proposed, designed, and verified the concept of using Fluidic Injection Thrust Reverser (FITR) systems on high bypass-ratio turbofan engines to reverse the flow of air and eliminate mechanical blockers completely.</p><p>Abstract 2: The goal of this project is to design an optimized FITR system and provide a quantitative analysis on its efficiency and feasibility.

Then for the Modelling phase, a scaled experimental model will be prototyped via multiple iterations and small-scale testing will be done to ensure perfect modelling. Lastly, in the Testing phase, the optimal prototype will undergo rigorous testing and the results will be used in the conclusions of this report.

To test if an educational intervention would be effective in this cultural setting, we designed two peer-to-peer health workshops: one on tobacco use and another on nutrition/physical activity (N/PA). A pre-workshop survey was used to provide a baseline on the current attitudes, knowledge, perceptions and behaviors of our cohort with regard to tobacco use, physical activity and nutrition. We randomly assigned each classroom a workshop and used a post workshop survey to assess changes in the student's beliefs for each health topic. Our results provide a summary of the current risky behaviors of ninth grade expatriates in the UAE. Moreover, we concluded that the tobacco workshop positively affected knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of tobacco use. The N/PA workshop affected the teenagers' level of satisfaction with their physical activity. This study provides evidence to support a national adoption of a peer-to-peer health education model as a tobacco use intervention.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Health</subject><subject source="lcsh">Exercise</subject><subject source="lcsh">Nutrition</subject><subject source="lcsh">Tobacco</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref73_h7d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Drivdahl Dougherty, Kelly Alice. <emph render="italic">Mussaffah vs. New York: A High Throughput Phenotype-Genotype Study to Explore Adaptive Evolution in Green Algae</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0051</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="129" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">129</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_2dad79512a3bd4aa7ffa131a6179a1d7" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_2dad79512a3bd4aa7ffa131a6179a1d7" type="Folder">2014-0051</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8142840f05688637348a1c9f07495e65"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology<lb/>Abstract: As the deciphering of algal metabolism becomes increasingly significant for algal optimization and its commercial applications, species' response and ultimately adaptation to environment becomes of particular practical interest. Because green algae can produce and accumulate lipids, the research model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been the subject of a large number of studies, including a genome-scale reconstruction of its metabolic network. The present study explores algal adaptation of three species, two from the USA and one from the UAE, to environment through temperature tolerance, metabolic capability, and genetics. High-throughput sequencing and metabolic phenotyping were used to define full metabolic profiles of these species and their phylogenetic assignments. Data indicates that while the isolates are closely related genetically across locations, and of the same species within the two locations, each strain has a unique metabolic profile and temperature range.

With a recent focus on improving healthcare in the nation, much importance is given to the emergence of gymnasiums that offer promises ranging from weight loss to better athletic performance. The anticipated expectations of accelerated results is brought about through the common, yet often uncontrolled, usage of performance-enhancing drugs and body supplements. This study aims to analyze the trends pertaining to supplement usage and perspectives in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. 200 weight-training participants were surveyed across 5 large gyms in the emirate. Results obtained saw high supplement usage, ranging from common protein supplements and creatine to suspected anabolic androgenic steroids. Major reasons for taking supplements, as reported by participants, were to "gain muscle mass", "improve athletic performance" and "reduce onset of muscle fatigue". Throughout this study, there appears to be an impetus to develop the "ideal" body revolving around the concept of a 'Western aesthetic physique'.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Gyms</subject><subject source="lcsh">Surveys</subject><subject source="lcsh">Public health</subject><subject source="lcsh">Health surveys</subject><subject source="lcsh">Doping in sports</subject><subject source="lcsh">Drugs</subject><subject source="lcsh">Proteins in human nutrition</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref79_3i5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nehme, Samer Intissar. <emph render="italic">Designing a Drug Delivery System Using Nanoparticle Technology</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0058</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="135" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">135</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_f8f9aea31a987b4cf2057b7191d7cab4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f8f9aea31a987b4cf2057b7191d7cab4" type="Folder">2014-0058</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f2dfb7efee9e3ff5e2562a782576c328"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology <lb/>Abstract: Iron Oxide (γ-Fe2O3) nanoparticles (NPs) had been coated with water soluble molecular containers called cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]).1 The cancer drug Paclitaxel3 (PTX) was successfully encapsulated in these macrocycles.

Diabetes prevalence among the UAE nationals were reported to be 24%, and 67% adults were obese or overweight, while 57% had central obesity [20,22]. The high prevalence of diabetes in the UAE is attributable to changes in lifestyle, yet the specific biochemical mechanisms that lead to  increased diabetes complications in this population is not known. In hyperglycemia, the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) through non-enzymatic glycation and oxidation of proteins is greatly accelerated [27]. The AGE/RAGE pathway has an important implication in the vascular damage that is observed in diabetes. This Capstone project is aimed to understand the epidemiology and the burden of diabetes worldwide and in the UAE, and to study the biochemical pathways that modulate diabetes complications. The first goal was achieved through literature research and clinical observation. The second goal was attained through experiments investigating the levels of several gene expressions in hyperglycemia and oxidative stress induced conditions in vitro. This study found that the expression of those genes changed during those conditions.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">AGE/RAGE pathway</subject><subject source="lcsh">Diabetes</subject><subject source="lcsh">Diseases |x Complications</subject><subject source="lcsh">Cardiovascular diseases</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref58_iu5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Stanley, Zachary David. <emph render="italic">Implementation of a Peer-Mediated Health Education Model in the United Arab Emirates; Understanding Risky Behaviors Among Expatriate Teens</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0061</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="114" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">114</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_65bb6823f2d801f84eb21ca898c9adc1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_65bb6823f2d801f84eb21ca898c9adc1" type="Folder">2014-0061</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6645354ab786f53b1a28388ea248f759"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology <lb/> Abstract: Tobacco use amongst young people is on the rise in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE is also ranked 15th in the world for incidence of type II diabetes. To test if an educational intervention would be effective in this cultural setting, we designed two peer-to-peer health workshops: one on tobacco and another on nutrition/physical activity (N/PA). We randomly assigned each classroom either a N/PA or tobacco workshop and used a post workshop survey to assess the effect of the workshops on the student's beliefs for each health topic. The N/PA workshop acted as a control group for tobacco related questions and vice versa. Our results provide a summary on the current risky behaviors of ninth grade expatriates in the UAE. Moreover, we concluded that the tobacco workshop positively affected knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of tobacco use, with noticeable spillover effects on perceptions of nutrition and physical activity as well. The N/PA workshop was only able to affect teenagers' level of satisfaction with their physical activity.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Diabetes</subject><subject source="lcsh">Tobacco</subject><subject source="lcsh">Health</subject><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Nutrition</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref64_ijv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Zarate-Rodriguez, Jorge. <emph render="italic">The Role of Microbiota in Shaping Host Physiology</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0049</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="120" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">120</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_44551f0a1f810f7c2ff63248c4e92744" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_44551f0a1f810f7c2ff63248c4e92744" type="Folder">2014-0049</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4af82f5f6bb39957577f15e2f8973be6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology <lb/> Abstract: An altered intestinal microbiome and high-fat diet (HFD) can each contribute to obesity, this study tried to elucidate their combined effects on host physiology.

STAT elevated total and fat mass in both NC and HFD mice compared to controls; a more substantial weight gain was observed when STAT and HFD were combined. To examine the effects on the microbiome, DNA was extracted from fecal samples and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that both STAT and HFD changed microbial community structure. To determine whether an altered microbiota could cause an obesity phenotype independently of exposure to antibiotics, the microbiota of 18-week old control and STAT mice was transferred to germ-free mice via oral gavage. STAT-recipient mice showed significant increases in total and adipose mass compared to control. Histological analysis showed no difference in mean surface area or frequency distribution of adipocyte surface area between control and treatment groups.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Physiology</subject><subject source="lcsh">Obesity</subject><subject source="local">Microbiome</subject><subject source="lcsh">Antibiotics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Bacteria</subject><subject source="lcsh">Penicillin</subject><subject source="lcsh">Fat</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref399_sfr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Asfoor, Janeen Waddah. <emph render="italic">Designing Peptide Based Inhibitors of Amyloid Protein Misfolding and Cytotoxicity</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0034</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3422" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3422</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_1f24fc2cbac8fc1381961829846f3f5f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_1f24fc2cbac8fc1381961829846f3f5f" type="Folder">2015-0034</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_015b752b2628257653c8e6a88e64da2f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology<lb/>Abstract: Amyloid diseases, which include neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and prion diseases, are characterized by the misfolding, aggregation and toxicity of cellular proteins. Segments of prion proteins have been show to function as cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), which can cross the cell membrane with high efficiency even when coupled to large cargoes. In this study, a new peptide composed of a highly charged segment (KKLVFF) from the Aβ peptide, associated with Alzheimer's diseases, and a targeting sequence, was studied to determine whether it can function as a CPP and inhibit the aggregation and toxicity of Aβ. My studies show that the peptide effectively inhibited the aggregation of Aβ, was not toxic to cells, and rapidly entered cells and localized to the mitochondria, which has been suggested as a target in a number of amyloid diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Significantly, these findings give us insight into developing a 'universal inhibitor' of amyloid protein aggregation and cytotoxicity.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Cell-penetrating peptides</subject><subject source="lcsh">Aggregation, Cell</subject><subject source="local">Cytotoxicity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Amyloid</subject><subject source="lcsh">Alzheimer's disease</subject><subject source="lcsh">Peptides</subject><subject source="lcsh">Prion proteins</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref395_u5t" level="file"><did><unittitle>Edmonds, Victoria Susan. <emph render="italic">Audio-Visual Integration in Speech Perception</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0043</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3420" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3420</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_70624a25a8a5cebdf04120763c74423a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_70624a25a8a5cebdf04120763c74423a" type="Folder">2015-0043</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1c19eb9767ce3cccb5513ef928256185"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology<lb/>Abstract: This study investigates whether speech perception is primarily subserved by modality-specific or amodal representations by expanding the work reported by Kim et al. (2004). Visual speech was used to prime auditory and written targets across four conditions: repetition, non-repetition, same-onset, and same-rhyme. Lexical decision task (word vs. pseudoword) reaction times were used to assess the degree of priming. Selective repetition priming for both auditory and written LDT's was predicted. Results demonstrated facilitatory priming of repetition, same-onset, and same-rhyme conditions compared to control for both words and pseudowords in the auditory LDT. In the written LDT, repetition and same-onset priming was found to facilitate processing of words while repetition priming inhibited priming of pseudowords. Together, these results suggest that silent visual articulations do influence language perception, which is consistent with an amodal model of language perception dependent on an underlying motor bases. It remains unclear whether visual speech simply activates phonological units without lexical-specificity, as suggested by results of the auditory LDT, or whether it activates words in the mental lexicon, as suggested by results of the written LDT.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Perception</subject><subject source="lcsh">Speeches</subject><subject source="local">Cross-modal priming</subject><subject source="lcsh">Priming (Psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Visual speech perception</subject><subject source="lcsh">Speech perception</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref387_tyx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wickramasinghe, Nadheera Madhavi. <emph render="italic">Zelda's Regulatory Role in the Neuroepithelial-to-Neuroblast Transition in the Developing Drosophila Larval Brain</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0038</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3416" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3416</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_5faed1b603065c7f3d082d80fd6211d5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_5faed1b603065c7f3d082d80fd6211d5" type="Folder">2015-0038</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5da5502c60aa5e57769ddcaf792684af"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Biology<lb/>Abstract: Zelda (Zld) is a transcription factor that is thought to coordinate the neuroepithelial (NE) stem cell network in the Drosophila larval brain. NE cells undergo differentiation to become neuroblasts (NB), which divide asymmetrically to maintain the correct balance of stem cells vs. differentiated cells. The NE-to-NB transition is controlled through the interaction of the EGFR and Notch signaling pathways. zld is expressed in NE cells of larval brains, and NE cells lacking Zld show early transformation into NBs. As such, we hypothesize that Zld is a possible regulator of the NE fate and thus integral to these pathways. The expression patterns of the Bearded (Brd), Ocho and escargot (esg) genes were assayed in wildtype and zld mutants as they are known to be expressed in NE cells. Zld was found to regulate the expression of Brd and esg, but not Ocho, suggesting that Zld only regulates certain genes involved in NE-to-NB transition. Many of the regulatory mechanisms involved in controlling NE cell fate are conserved between Drosophila and humans. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms through which Zld controls the NE-to-NB transition can lead to a better understanding of human neurodevelopmental diseases and brain tumors, as well as identifying targets for treatment.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Neural stem cells</subject><subject source="lcsh">Nervous system</subject><subject source="lcsh">Drosophila</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref480_umu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Batbold, Sarah. <emph render="italic">Investigating variation in Trichomonas vaginalis cytotoxicity and growth rate.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0045</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="8122" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">8122</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_fa9902e8986816ca5dc519e728933e31">Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated parasitic protist and the causative agent of trichomoniasis, the world's most prevalent non-viral STI.

The RNA motif of interest, N15, was found to carry out catalysis despite its stem-loop II structure being shorter. Two structural conformations were found to stabilize the core of the minimal N15min7, LCI (loop II-core interaction) and LSI (loop II-loop I interactions), which then facilitate catalytic activity of the RNA molecule. To further examine the HHR, N15min7 was assayed at 1 mM of MgCl2 to determine if these interactions are maintained at lower concentrations of divalent metal ions. When assaying the wild-type (WT) N15min7, LSI and LCI structures with deoxy-base substitution at lower concentrations of MgCl2, no significant difference in catalytic activity was observed among these three structures, indicating that an alternative interaction is taking place. Our results indicate that despite an overly simplistic structure, the N15min7 requires multiple interactions to catalyze self-cleavage at varying concentrations of divalent metal ions. Furthermore, the biological relevance of the N15min7 motif was determined by extensive computational searches for N15min7-like structures in a collection of ~8,000 genomes. The search identified ~100 instances of N15min7 sequences that can potentially form catalytically active structures.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ba9f2bd6b4a06e33810c053ec17b740d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Baby, Dhanya. <emph render="italic">Generation of a Wolbachia Secretome Resource for High-Throughput Analysis of Lymphatic Filariasis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0071</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_ae53b59cf3695d43bf3de9948bf2fb7a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_ae53b59cf3695d43bf3de9948bf2fb7a" type="Folder">2018-0071</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_006bb7caae197342ae6c57cba96820b8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the parasitic nematode, Brugia malayi. These roundworms persist in the human host for years, and the suspected mechanism is immunomodulation of the human immune system. Most of the filarial nematodes including B. malayi harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia in their lateral chords. The goal of this project was to generate a comprehensive resource to enable functional proteomics studies of the interactions between Wolbachia and human. We produced an Open Reading Frame (ORF) resource for high-throughput experimentation by synthesizing a subset of ORFs of secreted Wolbachial proteins. We successfully cloned over 80% of our synthesized ORFs into two destination vectors optimized for high-throughput experimentation, namely Yeast 2-Hybrid screening and protein expression.

Here, we focused on the role of the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein CBF-A, known to regulate mRNA transport by binding the RNA trafficking sequence located on the 3' UTR of mRNA transcripts. We applied genome wide approaches to MEFs from a CBF-A KO mouse to examine whether CBF-A mediates RNA trafficking at an early stage during RNA biogenesis in developing neurons. RNA-seq analysis of CBF-A KO and heterozygous (HT) MEFs showed that there are many neuronal genes altered in the absence of CBF-A. We then chemically reprogrammed CBF-A KO and HT MEFs into neuron-like cells. Immunostaining confirmed differential expression of neuronal markers. To begin characterizing the induced neurons, we tested 150 neuronal and fibroblast- specific primers on WT MEFs and reprogrammed neurons to create a primer profile for future analyses. Results from this study confirm a primary role of CBF-A in RNA biogenesis and begins to highlight its importance in achievement of cell fate during neuronal development.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_a8f149558cd912512d1c44eaf9bfa1c6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Choi, JooHee. <emph render="italic">Characterizing the Transposable Element Landscape of Date Palm (Phoenix dactylifera)</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0052</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_cd3e5242b525515b7c51eabc183602bb" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_cd3e5242b525515b7c51eabc183602bb" type="Folder">2018-0052</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a53fae59d74c1def5e8f339c614141ed"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) is a culturally and economically important crop across the Middle East, South Asia, and Northern Africa- yet our understanding of its genome remains relatively limited. This study aims to detect and characterize the transposable element (TE) landscape in this significant species through a novel combination of both library-based (Repeatmodeler) and k-mer based (REPdenovo) computational methods. The resulting consensus reads were masked via Repeatmasker and mapped to a gene map (NCBI: GCF_000413155.1_DPV01). Of the 500Mb genome assmbly, 38% was annotated as repetitive elements, of which LTR Copia and Gypsy were predominant. Comparison of element length and divergence indicate that LTR Copia elements are likely young and recently active. When mapped against regions upstream and downstream to genes, there was a relative abundance of Gypsy upstream compared to Copia, that may suggest an innate insertion bias at play. Of the elements uniquely assembled by REPdenovo, a majority were identified as plastid-derived sequences. Estimates suggest approximately 0.2% of the date palm genome consists of such elements, highlighting a category of plant DNA often overlooked. Through this study, we provide a TE-level understanding of the date palm genome structure that may act as a "roadmap" in future palm studies.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3c4456490745e6a7cb28a04abc9f5bc4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Degutis, Karolis. <emph render="italic">Investigation of Top-down and Bottom-up Signals in Visual Working Memory in V1</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0076</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_414ea9605926b5300177aea120206a9f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_414ea9605926b5300177aea120206a9f" type="Folder">2018-0076</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cd419f36daf316bf4639ac0209c3fad6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Working memory (WM) allows for the maintenance of information over short periods of time when the initial source of the information is no longer present. In this study, we investigated whether the visual WM signal in the primary visual cortex (V1) is top-down or bottom-up using 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A top-down signal would indicate storage of visual WM outside of V1, while a bottom-up signal would indicate V1 maintenance. The direction of the signal was operationalized with an Attention and Perception task; each one activating distinct neural populations within V1. These patterns of activity were then compared using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to the pattern elicited from a visual WM task. The study replicated previous results by finding orientation-selective information present in V1 without a high-amplitude sustained BOLD response. We also found significant similarity between the patterns of the visual WM and Attention tasks. These results suggest a top-down signal in V1 during the maintenance of visual WM, consistent with the idea that visual WM is not maintained within V1.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_83468e067039826963990dc1573f9549" level="file"><did><unittitle>Fadil, Chaimaa. <emph render="italic">Single-Cell Transcriptome Profiling of the Drosophila Optic Lobe Suggests a Regulation of Terminal Characters by Cell Type-Specific Transcription Factor Cohorts</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0094</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_d2d32f5f04c80f94572914f1aab7da97" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d2d32f5f04c80f94572914f1aab7da97" type="Folder">2018-0094</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5c6a8a1f597e4d3d4a5a456974c50ed5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Understanding how a system comes to be and what its different components are is critical to deciphering its mode of action. In multicellular organisms, it is now established that transcription factors expressed during development play a key role in specifying cell fate. However, to better encompass cellular diversity, we are yet to understand how molecular specification translates into character acquisition. This study takes a holistic and unbiased approach to molecularly characterize cellular diversity in the adult Drosophila optic lobe based on Drop-seq single-cell RNA-seq of 57,000 cells. With unsupervised analysis and differential expression testing, I identified 52 clusters of transcriptionally distinct single-cell populations. I annotated several clusters by correspondence to known cell types on the basis of canonical markers or by characterizing cells' localization and projection patterns using Gal4 lines. Regulatory interactions between the transcription factors apterous and traffic-jam and the respective markers of cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons, ChAT and VGlut, were confirmed by gene knock-down through RNAi. Interestingly, these results, in addition to a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), showed that cell types with similar phenotypes do not necessarily share the same transcription factor signature, thus suggesting that phenotypic convergence is a likely cellular evolutionary model in Drosophila.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6289011fc74d4d7f093bfed3fd0e44c8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Govind, Jigar. <emph render="italic">Long-Term Balancing Selection at MHC class I loci in the Ethiopian frog Leptopelis gramineus</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0077</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_4963ff153a9e7f5d138bd045da1fee46" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_4963ff153a9e7f5d138bd045da1fee46" type="Folder">2018-0077</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3b70bdd4edf1d38f1e9845bfecdd8734"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In the defense against diseases, organisms must maintain a repertoire of molecules that can respond to the variety of pathogens in their habitat. The variety of pathogenic threats present in one's surroundings depends on several environmental variables, including climate.

I hypothesized that the signature of balancing selection is stronger in warmer climates. I used neutral markers to reconstruct the demographic history of each clade belonging to L. gramineus, measured genetic diversity, differentiation, and gene flow, and simulated these measures against neutral scenarios. While intra-specific subpopulation Tajima's D and Fu and Li's analyses revealed strong evidence for balancing selection, inter-specific analysis revealed a lack of clear genetic structure at MHC class I loci with respect to differences in clade, elevation difference, and geographical distance. Instead, the data demonstrate clear effects of long-term balancing selection that may predate the spatial dispersal of L. gramineus across Ethiopia.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f0bd600fc1bf82f75c1e2e9eeefcb7fd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jankauskas, Robertas. <emph render="italic">During differentiation nuclear beta-actin regulates neuronal gene programs</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0064</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_da4a77ac21a53f824b0d7a0d11d8a811" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_da4a77ac21a53f824b0d7a0d11d8a811" type="Folder">2018-0064</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a878d1551cc374b758e44a0039b3eb1a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>During the process of cellular differentiation global changes in chromatin lead to genome organization and the suppression and activation of gene programs. Emerging evidence indicates that nuclear β-actin is a major regulator of genome organization. β-actin performs this important function by regulating genomic deposition of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex. This leads to tethering of heterochromatin to the NL while controlling the level of euchromatin. To further study the role of nuclear actin in these processes and its potential impact on development and differentiation, here we implemented a direct reprogramming protocol on embryonic fibroblasts from a β-actin knockout mouse to directly reprogram them into induced neurons. We report differences in neuronal morphology between WT, HET, and KO cell lines arising from differential gene expression levels. Many of the compromised genes were found to be downregulated in a β-acting dosage dependent manner. GO term analysis found that these changes compromised programs related to neuronal development. Reintroducing an NLS containing β-actin in the KO cells positively affected neuron specific marker expression. Because the model organism is embryonic lethal at developmental stage 10.5 we conclude that nuclear β-actin helps regulate neuronal gene expression during development.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8478f5c17a32437ca08b25edae26695a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kirwan, Liam Ingmar. <emph render="italic">Identification of Natural Products from Sponge/Tunicate-Associated Bacterial Species in the Abu Dhabi Region</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0072</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_36b39380878d0454f06da11a284657c0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_36b39380878d0454f06da11a284657c0" type="Folder">2018-0072</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f8eb811b94fbee370a0fa0f248db3a3c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Marine invertebrate-associated bacteria are a promising source of natural products, especially in harsh conditions (such as Abu Dhabi) where metabolitefacilitated adaptation is necessary.

Previous RNA-seq analysis identified the top 10 upregulated TEs in uhrf1 mutants as compared to wild type (WT) larvae. Here, I analyzed the genomic features of these TEs and their pattern of expression by in situ hybridization (ISH). Bioinformatics analysis showed a significant correlation (r=0.6328 for WT and r=0.5871 for uhrf1 mutants) between read counts and number of full length reads. ISH showed significant expression of TEs in both the WT and uhrf1 mutant larvae, particularly in the brain, eyes and jaws. In the mutants, we observed a difference in signal in some TEs, but not major differences in the pattern of expression between WT and uhrf1 mutants. Phylogenetic analysis of the reverse transcriptase domains of the LTR Gypsy elements showed that Gypsy117-I_DR expressed the greatest fold change.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9082f3e973340304c82f31ba0ee55e3c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mo, Ziyi. <emph render="italic">Phylogenetics of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) and closely related wild species elucidates the nature of introgressive hybridization between North African date palm and Phoenix theophrasti</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0086</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_44d894d12ce569babe4761a814d11d14" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_44d894d12ce569babe4761a814d11d14" type="Folder">2018-0086</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d1be175ba41f75d8c43be08f700c0d20"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The domestication history of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), an important staple crop in the Middle East and North Africa, is not well understood. The popular model of domestication argues that date palm originated from the Middle East and later spread westward to North Africa via trade routes. However, higher observed nucleotide diversity within the North African date palm population suggests that the North African population is not the product of recent colonization, thereby contradicting the model. This study of 71 date palm cultivars from across Middle East and North Africa and 6 of its closely related wild species reconciles the higher observed nucleotide diversity in North African population and the popular domestication model by demonstrating that the North African date palm population is a result of introgressive hybridization between date palm and P. theophrasti. Linkage disequilibrium analysis and phylogeny of phased haplotypes in highly introgressed genomic region provide evidence for intro- gression, whereas chloroplast and mitochondrial phylogeny reveals that hybridization occurred through pollination of date palm offshoots by P. theophrasti.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_73be677575e49a3897e94d1196fa8348" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nehme, Mona. <emph render="italic">Adaptation of mitochondrial Oxidative Phosphorylation Genes to High Altitude in Leptopelis gramineus</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0049</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_0f960b6cf87d392a0d5f474717b8f385" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0f960b6cf87d392a0d5f474717b8f385" type="Folder">2018-0049</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5c5943f3a5d67635c6aa6c6493ed9807"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Harsh environmental conditions are common characteristics of high altitudes, such as those in the Ethiopian highlands. This can be detrimental to the survival of maladapted organisms, yet these areas continue to be biodiversity hotspots. This alludes to adaptive selection that equips high altitude organisms, such as Ethiopian endemic frog Leptopelis gramineus , with the capacity to survive in hazardous conditions. The mitochondrial genome has been previously shown to be crucial in adaptation due to it comprising of rapidly evolving non-recombining sequences. In this paper, I studied the role played by mtOXPHOS genes in adaptation to high altitude in L. gramineus using aBSREL, FEL, and MEME analytical methods . Diversifying selection was found in codons 42 in ATP8 and 311 and 317 in ND1. However, this selection could not be attributed to adaptation to high altitude considering the individuals who expressed the necessary mutations were collected from varying altitudes. The result could also potentially be related to incomplete lineage sorting resulting from high mutation rates in the addressed codon positions. Therefore, further analysis is needed in order to determine the role of ATP8 and ND1 on L. gramineus high altitude adaptation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_afb15db1862303ae72aac671ff3177e0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Šabanović, Merima. <emph render="italic">What it takes to be at the top: The complex interrelationship between chronic social stress and social dominance</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0103</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_9d172f71e95e7b4c6463d42ceb1e8440" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9d172f71e95e7b4c6463d42ceb1e8440" type="Folder">2018-0103</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bf4e48c8c72f71caf5bdf5dbd9205ea3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Most animal societies are organized in dominance hierarchies that affect an individual's reproductive success and access to resources. Exposure to stress is one of many complex factors contributing to hierarchy formation, but a hierarchical status itself can be stress-inducing. I aimed to elucidate the complex relationship between stress and dominance by delineating how social rank predicts vulnerability to social stress and whether chronic stress modulates hierarchy establishment. Using the C57 mouse model, hierarchical rank is studied using an automated social confrontation tube test that is consistent with at least three other dominance measures. Chronic social stress is mimicked by the chronic social defeat (CSD) paradigm that induces a depressive-like phenotype in stress-susceptible mice. I show that exposure to chronic stress predicts higher success in subsequent hierarchy formation. The mice that underwent CSD exhibited markedly higher winning ratios than their stress-naïve conspecifics. Results also suggest that the differences in social competitiveness are not related to the overall differences in stress-susceptibility, but hierarchical status may predispose the subordinate ranks to decreased baseline social preference. In contrast, dominant males are liable to higher anxious-like behavior following CSD-stress. Furthermore, I also demonstrate how individual housing conditions markedly increases a range of anxiety-like behaviors. I additionally report preliminary data on a neural circuit potentially underlying dominance- and stress-specific signal integration.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_15882bd36384814b240f5e712049a578" level="file"><did><unittitle>Saleh, Hadi Omar. <emph render="italic">CPP-Cargo Complex Translocation in Model Membrane Systems: Experiments and Simulations</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0057</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_ed72b8ec4834523b1a91b8b877327f7c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_ed72b8ec4834523b1a91b8b877327f7c" type="Folder">2018-0057</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b399b01c249a2d2c67328092616cceb9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Cancer is a disease of multicellular organisms characterized by uncontrolled cell division.

Confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis confirmed the reorganization of chromatin structure and histone modifications in the absence of NMI. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that these genome-wide changes in the level of histone modifications are accompanied by a significant differential expression of genes associated with cellular response to DNA damage and DNA repair. We propose that NMI plays an important role in establishing histone modifications through its interaction with chromatin remodeling complexes, leading to proper activation of DNA damage response gene programs.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_94b4fa7168898ea785b14e5845aa9a94" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wunsche, Leonore. <emph render="italic">Endoplasmic Reticulum Morphology as an Indicator for Stress Severity</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0066</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_b468c336d061b4f03d79a704f1950060" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b468c336d061b4f03d79a704f1950060" type="Folder">2018-0066</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a86b8ac4f24e46c2b7cf9ab3c99b30d0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) serves to counteract the accumulation of proteins in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) during stress.

We reasoned that alterations in ER morphology would occur during an adaptive phase, where ER phenotypes could indicate early stress responses. We tested this utilizing intravital confocal imaging of 5 dpf transgenic zebrafish expressing a hepatocyte specific ER marker. We defined seven ER phenotypes in during various stress conditions (tunicamycin, ethanol, trappc11 and nAtf6) and scored for their prevalence. Tunicamycin, a well-established ER-stressor, caused motile punctae which retained the fluorescent ER label. These emerged at 12 hours and were present in 74% of larvae after 24 hours of tunicamycin exposure. Furthermore, the ER punctae colocalised with LysoTracker, a fluorescent dye staining acidic structures. Gene expression analysis showed UPR target gene upregulation in livers from larvae with extensive ER punctae prevalence, compared to those looking like controls. Thus, our ER marker represents a proxy for identifying ER stress states, where morphology changes can indicate the fish most prone to disease.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_87d055e5581d28defda168577dcac4a4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jansen, Gloria. <emph render="italic">Effect of Chronic Social Stress on Homeostatic Sleep Response</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0065</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_edec19573009ac3c993092514b2725c0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_edec19573009ac3c993092514b2725c0" type="Folder">2018-0065</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_146e377ef99c98aa24b7c78a976adfcf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A remarkably conserved behavior, sleep is thought to restore neural circuits and their synaptic outputs. Clinical findings that sleep deprivation can reverse symptoms of depression support putative interactions between mood and sleep/wake regulation. The molecular pathways that govern these interactions remain ambiguous.

Combining electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis with transcriptomics of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) in the midbrain, we investigated homeostatic sleep response after 4-hour total sleep deprivation (TSD) in stress-susceptible and -resilient mice. Susceptible mice spent an average 9% more time in REM rebound sleep, while resilient mice exhibited elevated non-REM (NREM) sleep following TSD. Prolonging time awake by TSD had differential effects on expression of synaptic plasticity genes Arc and BDNF, potassium channels and neuroinflammatory genes in susceptible and resilient groups. Thus, we show that differential response to CSD stress influences global sleep architecture as well as localized molecular dynamics.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_54e8cdb8d29f091c4257e05a50b3db44" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sveiczer, Zsofia. <emph render="italic">Evaluating 'activity-silent' and 'persistent neural activity' models of visual working memory</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0069</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_53cf9a91f5fe1e77e2b4c5cefca3129c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_53cf9a91f5fe1e77e2b4c5cefca3129c" type="Folder">2018-0069</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d4fcfdd669db0ba4bd0df3c6f4f83eff"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Currently there are two competing hypotheses about how neurons keep information active in WM. One commonly accepted theory claims that information is maintained in WM through 'persistent neural activity'. This refers to the idea that neurons keep information active through constant firing despite the fact that the information is no longer present. Recent evidence indicates that memories are also potentially stored through 'activity-silent' states, where the functional architecture of the neural network is altered in a way that memories instead of being active representations are being stored as a silent pattern of synaptic weights. While this 'activity-silent' model could provide a compelling explanation for some neural data, it doesn't constitute conclusive evidence yet. The overall aim of this research is to propose a novel way to evaluate the two potential models of visual WM, thus providing further evidence for potential mechanisms that could possibly present in WM. We tested this hypothesis behaviorally using a continuous report WM task, and neurally using functional MRI (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to uncover patterns of brain activity that contained information about WM items.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_43fd1d4e50982750c3c2a0ee70e025cb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al-Ajlouni, Yazan. <emph render="italic">Investigating the Association between Midwakh smoking behaviors and risk factors of Cardiovascular Disease and Hypertension among UAE nationals: Findings from the UAE Healthy Future Study.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0092</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_a0931b5d04bc57280475c169252cdc24" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a0931b5d04bc57280475c169252cdc24" type="Folder">2019-0092</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f6589e29facabb2bcbc690e91c6ba812"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Midwakh is an emerging type of smoking, specifically popular among the youth in the Arab gulf region.

Modified Poisson models with robust error variance were computed to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between smoking behavior (e.g., Midwakh only, Dual-use with cigarettes or Shisha, or poly-use of Midwakh, Cigarettes, and Shisha) and measures of Hypertension (e.g., Systolic Blood Pressure, Diastolic Blood Pressure, and Heart Rate) and CVD measures (Cholesterol, Triglyceride, HDL, LDL, Apolipoprotein A, and Apolipoprotein B). Compared to smoking cigarettes, Midwakh smoking was significantly associated with increased risk of Apolipoprotein A and Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL). Future research should investigate whether this relationship is causal and study other health outcomes risks for smoking Midwakh among this high-risk population.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1b5490b260aa263870ee70bde4c422cb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ali, Ghaniba. <emph render="italic">Population genetics of four commercially important fisheries species in the southern Arabian Gulf</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0109</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_ec791bee631093589fba6f74e3d6dbb0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_ec791bee631093589fba6f74e3d6dbb0" type="Folder">2019-0109</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b87adac7f252952ef0d87c1ad471b981"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Overharvesting has resulted in dramatic declines of stocks of commercial fish species in the UAE in recent years. Although a variety of management efforts have been put in place, there is currently limited information on the population dynamics of fish species in the UAE. This information is crucial to guide the development of Mrine Protected Areas. This study explored the population structure of four commercially important fish species in the UAE: Diagramma pictum (painted sweetlips), Carangoides bajad (orange-spotted trevally), Epinephelus coioides (orange-spotted grouper), and Lethrinus borbonicus (snubnose emperor). Using RADsequencing we report evidence of a significant population structure within D. pictum that divides the species into two populations across the southern Arabian Gulf. The other three species, C. bajad, E. coioides, and L. borbonicus, did not reveal a population structure, suggesting that this population homogeneity could potentially be a result of adult spawning aggregates or larval dispersal. The results have important implications for informing the design of future Marine Protected Areas in the southern Arabian Gulf.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_784d89ddc006e26545801bc4304a500b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aqel, Hala. <emph render="italic">Jet Lag as a Global Stressor: Effect of Shifting Light on Depressive-Like Behavior and Stress Susceptibility</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0096</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_07fffead85b1bd94f7689b75e3a75873" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_07fffead85b1bd94f7689b75e3a75873" type="Folder">2019-0096</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_efdff9aa1abe4b0645c2f6c33b7c198a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a disease increasing in occurrence globally.

Due to evidence indicating that shifting light cycles and mood are interconnected, I aim to investigate whether a chronic jet lag paradigm modelled in mice produces depression-like behavior comparable to the chronic social defeat paradigm.

One of the most important factors source of variation in the severity of such symptoms is the host immune system. Host immune system consists of multiple layers of defense, but the ultimate step of an efficient response to clear the parasites is the production of immunoglobulins. Here we focus on immunoglobulins M (IgM) with the aim to clarify the nature of IgM changes taking place during the course of Plasmodium falciparum infection and if these changes are controlled by host genotype. The study population is a pediatric cohort in Burkina Faso, consisting of children sampled before infection, during asymptomatic infection, during symptomatic infection and three weeks after treatment. IgM levels were quantified using ELISA and compared between the four groups and tested for association with parasitemia in the symptomatic infection group. Furthermore, we report genetic variants in candidate genes associated with IgM levels. Combined, these results document changes of IgM levels in vivo in a pediatric cohort in Africa and show how host genotype can modulate IgM response to Plasmodium falciparum.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_676d702c14af3ea73ff30798ce12a028" level="file"><did><unittitle> Farrukh, Sannia. <emph render="italic">DNA damage dependent regulation of p53 pathway by Nuclear Myosin I</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0081</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_263fe9d993dad7ad5e766c1a7073c746" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_263fe9d993dad7ad5e766c1a7073c746" type="Folder">2019-0081</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_797accbf48cec7673307848661f23f78"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Nuclear myosin 1 (NM1) is an emerging key regulator of transcription and chromatin organization. It has been implicated in several nuclear processes involving chromatin remodeling and histone modifications. Recent studies have highlighted the role of myosins in DNA repair, however how NM1 regulates that pathway is still unknown. Using NM1 knockout mouse fibroblasts, we show that NM1 gene deletion leads to differential expression of genes involved in DNA damage response and cell cycle. We found that genes that are downstream p53 signaling are down regulated and that cells lacking NM1 display constitutive DNA damage foci. Based on these observations, we silenced NM1 by siRNA to study its function in response to DNA damage. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and qPCR analyses on cells subjected to NM1 knockdown revealed that NM1 binding to the p21 gene is enhanced upon DNA damage. These results also showed that NM1 facilitates the binding of PCAF and Set1 to the p21 gene, leading to active expression of the p21 gene. Thus, we propose that NM1 plays a regulatory role in the p53 signaling pathway and is recruited across the p21 gene to facilitate recruitment of histone modifiers that induces histone acetylation and methylation, facilitating p21 gene activation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_837f8ca95397b23cb18c8bbc373935a8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gjorgjieva, Tamara. <emph render="italic">The role of β-actin in the direct reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to osteoblast-like cells</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0124</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_24cff897f826dd011f3144394ccb678c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_24cff897f826dd011f3144394ccb678c" type="Folder">2019-0124</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_41fda6ef3e81ce55f5ee30615a57c07e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Actin has many functions in the nucleus. Our lab recently showed that the loss of β-actin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) leads to differential expression of gene programs related to development and differentiation, including neurogenesis. In this study, we directly reprogrammed MEFs to osteoblast-like cells. Firstly, we showed that mineralization of the extracellular matrix correlates with β-actin level: β-actin-/- KO cells show mineralization after 4 days, whereas β-actin+/-HET and β-actin+/+ WT cells require 8 and 14 days, respectively. Using Scanning Electron Microscopy, we also observed hydroxyapatite-like polycrystalline structures secreted exclusively by KO cells on day 4. We also performed RNA-seq analysis on all the CiOsteo cells, and found genes related to osteogenesis that are dysregulated between WT and KO CiOsteo cells. Lastly, we identified increased heterochromatization at the loci of key regulatory genes, such as Msx1 and Mmp13 that are downregulated in KO CiOsteo. In summary, we propose that β-actin is required for regulating the chromatin accessibility during direct reprogramming: in the absence of β-actin, key regulatory genes remain heterochromatinized and thus not transcribed, resulting in a hypermineralization phenotype.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_27414be8cf565a9ebcbfdb1a919b890f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hariyani, Imtiyaz Enayatali. <emph render="italic">Speciation and transposable element amplification in the Ethiopian frog species Ptychadena neumanni</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0112</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_fbb12e45e96d07d3a08c6c3b09a47430" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_fbb12e45e96d07d3a08c6c3b09a47430" type="Folder">2019-0112</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9567a663cb6fa9d9f3fe3cea6f7b796a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Transposable elements (TEs) exhibit high variation in diversity and copy number in vertebrates, which has important evolutionary implications as they constitute a source of evolutionary novelties. The dynamics of TEs are strongly affected by factors such as host demography. In small populations, genetic drift opposes the effect of negative selection and can result in the fixation of TE insertions that would be eliminated in large populations. The carrier subpopulation hypothesis predicts that population subdivision caused by vicariance or dispersal may trigger fixation of TE families by genetic drift. We used the Ethiopian Ptychadena neumanni species complex to test this hypothesis and to investigate any relation between speciation and TE amplification. Using a high-quality genome sequence for P. cf. neumanni 2, we identified 2342 repeat families de novo using RepeatModeler and characterized the repeat landscape of the frog using RepeatMasker. Resequencing data from six closely related frog species were used to identify mobile element insertions that differ among species. Our analysis revealed that the amplification of TEs is consistent with the evolutionary history of the host inferred by SNPs. We also observed substantial differences in the rate of amplification of TEs between species.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_474dd3abfa59d66bf8a1120142be265b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kapetancic, Erna. <emph render="italic">Targeted Delivery of Therapeutics for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0116</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_cd286504d84681ba5544a442b5182fea" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_cd286504d84681ba5544a442b5182fea" type="Folder">2019-0116</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_782a6e3c6b82a68d4540640625ff7f1a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a cancer characterized by increased growth of granulocytic precursors. Currently, there are two therapeutic strategies to CML: imatinib mesylate, and a combination of arsenic trioxide and IFN-α. Imatinib is effective in controlling the chronic phase of the disease, but it is not curative since most of patients who discontinue the therapy relapse. The combination of arsenic trioxide and IFN-α is a novel treatment, which has been shown to reduce the clonogenic activity of CML cells ex vivo, and prolong the survival of primary CML mice. However, the major downside of this combinatorial treatment is its lack of specificity. The present study aims to overcome this lack of specificity by creating BSA-PLGA nanoparticles which encapsulate arsenic trioxide and IFN-α. To specifically target CML cells, Y-R-A-P-W-P-P sequence (CML cell-associated peptide) was conjugated to BSA surface.In vitro, these nanoparticles showed to be more effective in inducing apoptosis in CML cell lines than the current therapeutic strategies to CML. In vivo, the nanoparticles depleted all GFP-positive CML cells from CML mice blood.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_55ad8146be323d974cb44532414b6847" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lakhiani, Priyanka. <emph render="italic">Atf6-mediated Transcriptomic Signatures in Cellular Environments of Unfolded Protein Response Activation</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0068</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_3a0e62a8f577214703c7aeef8525c9b2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3a0e62a8f577214703c7aeef8525c9b2" type="Folder">2019-0068</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3dbe4f99ba9c5bf73aa7039f116cbe8b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR); activating transcription factor 6 (Atf6) mediates one of three branches of this signaling pathway. UPR induction, however, can manifest heterogeneously across distinct conditions, generating variable molecular signatures and pathogenic phenotypes. This study aimed to elucidate the role of Atf6 in mediating UPR induction in zebrafish livers by characterizing Atf6-regulated transcriptomic signatures under distinct stressors. Putative Atf6 target genes were curated via a predicted consensus sequence and scraping transcription factor databases. UPR genes were similarly identified by compiling genes annotated for relevant Reactome and Gene Ontology terms. Curated gene lists were analyzed using RNAseq data from an atf6-overexpressing transgenic model of UPR induction; Atf6 was sufficient to cause differential expression of 23.6% of Atf6 target genes and 34.5% of UPR genes. RNAseq data from livers exposed to ethanol and arsenic was integrated to identify downstream genes inducible under environments of ER stress. Thus, by analyzing transcriptomic patterns and their biological relevance, we found that Atf6 mediates distinct forms of UPR activation through complex regulatory programs dependent on cellular environment.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_187126ebb5b2fc5e05d1bbea4411d36d" level="file"><did><unittitle>McHardie, Tayla. <emph render="italic">Optimisation of Palmitic Acid Production in Chloroidium sp.

Coral reef fish are exclusively ectotherms, so their physiological performance is directly tied to environmental temperatures and behavioral modulation is critical for ectotherms to regulate internal body temperatures. This study examined the effects of temperature and time of day on fish behavior in model fish from PAG, Lutjanus ehrenbergii (Blackspot snapper) and Scolopsis ghanam (Arabian monocle bream), at 18°C, 27°C, and 35.5°C between morning (07:15), noon (12:55), and evening (18:35). Specifically, five ecologically important behaviors: relative swimming speed, activity, exploration, sheltering, and sociability. Results showed that there were significant interactions between time of day and temperature on relative swimming speed, activity, and exploration, where each measure would increase as temperature increased and had peak values in the evening. Conversely, there were only interactions with temperature for S. ghanam, where sheltering was lowest at the thermal optimal 27°C. These behavioral modulations may be used to acclimate to extreme thermal stress within the region.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7910e9acfe5019bd978205cb862a9b4f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nayfeh, Layanne. <emph render="italic">Characterizing Genetic And Epigenetic Modifications Of An Alga With Increased Lipid Accumulation Phenotype</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0074</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_938328f96399dae7c6c514c2de4b54d9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_938328f96399dae7c6c514c2de4b54d9" type="Folder">2019-0074</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ef366aae00c8f7513ec159c1186e3626"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Salehi-Ashtiani lab has been optimizing the lipid content of microalgae, specifically the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to efficiently produce compounds that can serve as substitutes for fossil fuels.

The broad objective of this project is to explore the hypothesis that there are specific epigenetic modifications involved in regulation of transcripts and can lead to increased lipid accumulation in the unicellular microalga under certain environmental conditions. To investigate, we carried out bisulfite sequencing and analyzed the results for a subset of 112 transcripts encoding 10 genes, which are involved in C. reinhardtii's lipid production pathways. Although there isn't substantial differences in methylation levels collectively between the parental C. reinhardtii (CC-503) strain and the CC-H5 mutant, there were two genes that showed significant differences in methylation levels.

This interaction has been unsuccessfully modeled in mice due to a failure to adhere to common behavioral models of stress. Given the need to reliably investigate this relationship, the social defeat model of depression was used to determine how stress affects sleep architecture and sleep regulation, and how sleep can prevent or induce stress susceptibility. Combining EEG with transcriptomics of the medial prefrontal cortex, we found that mice susceptible to chronic social defeat (CSD) stress displayed fragmented NREM sleep with intrusions of wakefulness, which may be explained by differential expression of serotonergic receptors Htr1a/2a and afternoon blunting of Slc29a3 adenosine transport. Exposure to CSD increased the proportion of REM sleep at the beginning of the light cycle through more frequent but shorter bouts, which were associated with blunted morning expression of serotonergic signaling enzyme Prkcd and myelin function gene Mobp. Furthermore, manipulating sleep through TSD or REM deprivation (REMD) suggested that recovery sleep after REMD, but not TSD, may promote resilience to stress. Findings from this Capstone project therefore support the notion that susceptibility to stress and adaptive sleep responses mutually affect each other.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c062f6d6e65bfc24401ff612664b99ee" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ahmad, Anique. <emph render="italic">Phenotypic divergence and marked population structure in the Arabian gray mangroves (Avicennia marina)</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0090</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_211e12e0eb37eb4483f5e07975556081" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_211e12e0eb37eb4483f5e07975556081" type="Folder">2020-0090</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4267cf82bbcef7f8c55af9aee5fa6d8e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Population differentiation involves both selective and neutral factors and here we study patterns of neutral genetic divergence and phenotypic differentiation in the Arabian gray mangrove using genome-wide markers and a suite of leaf-associated morphological traits between the Arabian Sea, where oceanic conditions exist, and the geographically isolated stands from the Arabian Gulf, one of the hottest and most saline seas in the world. Multivariate analyses based neutral SNPs revealed marked population structure between and among the Arabian Gulf and the Arabian Sea, suggesting strong genetic drift and limited gene flow. Our analyses also showed that leaf stomatal density was 27% lower in populations inside the Arabian Gulf compared to those outside, an adaptive response to cope with the higher temperature and salinity of the Persian/Arabian Gulf. These results suggest that the combined effects of natural selection and drift in isolation are driving population divergence in the Arabian gray mangroves.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Upon infection, transcriptional activation of host immune cells is required to mount an efficient immune response. Both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the regulation of transcription, but little is known about these effects in malaria. Here we focus on documenting the temporal changes in chromatin accessibility of circulating immune cells at three stages: before infection, during asymptomatic parasitemia, and during symptomatic parasitemia. First, an Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin ATAC-seq protocol was developed and optimized to frozen Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells PBMCs collected from malarial African children. Sequencing of bulk and single-cell ATAC-seq libraries generated high quality sequencing data that was analyzed using multiple pipelines. These analyses generated the first ATAC-seq data in malaria and provided genome-wide insight about temporal changes in chromatin accessibility and cell-types implicated during infection. scATAC-seq data revealed accessibility patterns that are masked in bulk analysis. These PBMCs accessibility maps are the foundation for future epigenetic studies aiming to better understand host in vivo immune response to malaria.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Given that one of the first responses to widespread oncogenic signals is the activation of tumor-suppressive processes, including cellular senescence, we asked whether global DNA hypomethylation activates oncogene and leads to senescence. We used 5 days post fertilization (dpf) zebrafish mutants that lack a key DNA methylation component, DNA methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1), to answer this question.  Through our experiments and RNAseq analysis, we found that there's global DNA hypomethylation, senescence, up-regulation of immune response pathway genes, but no significant altered expression of oncogenes in dnmt1 mutant livers. We concluded that dnmt1 loss induces senescence in zebrafish hepatocytes, but this is not oncogene-induced. Alternatively, it could be activation of transposons that causes senescence in this case.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Though it has been established that depressed patients exhibit aberrant circadian rhythms, little is known about the mechanism behind this phenomenon. In fact, it is still unclear whether circadian dysregulation is a cause or consequence of mood disorders. Understanding this relationship will help in the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of mood disorders. This study, therefore, investigated the effect of stress on the oscillation of an SCN output molecule, Prokineticin-2 (PK2). We studied the differential expression of PK2, the clock gene Period1 and the PK2's receptor, PKR2, in stress-susceptible and resilient mice at different times of the light-dark cycle in both the SCN and LHb at the mRNA level using quantitative PCR. Our study shows that stress-susceptible mice have upregulation of PK2 in the LHb, while stress-resilient mice exhibit a phase advance in Per1 rhythmicity in the LHb.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

The rise of SSTs reduces oxygen to be dissolved in water, while simultaneously increasing the metabolic oxygen demand in fishes. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether gill remodeling occurred in tropical fish, specifically in Scolopsis ghanam, in relation to temperature change. Gill remodeling could increase oxygen uptake and transport by increasing the surface area available for absorption. S. ghanam was assessed at three different temperatures representing the natural range of temperatures for the Arabian Gulf, 18 ˚C (winter), 27 ˚C (shoulder season), and 35.5 ˚C (summer). Using histology images, five gill parameters were measured (filament length, number of lamellae, perimeter of lamellae, lamellae base thickness, and intralamellar cellular mass). With the exception of lamellae perimeter, all measured traits showed significant variation with temperature. This is the first study to demonstrate gill remodeling in tropical reef fish in response to temperature change, with important implications for how fish throughout the tropics may respond to future climate change.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Sleep presents itself as a symptom and cause in mood disorders. In this project, Chronic Social Defeat was used to induce stress-susceptible or stress-resilient subjects through physical stress. Behavioral tests determine phenotypes, then mice were subjected to sleep deprivation either during the day or night. Although mice are nocturnal, their polyphasic sleep patterns can be disturbed through night-sleep deprivation. Following sleep deprivation, homeostatic sleep response was observed. Through electroencephalography/electromyography recordings, vigilance states and sleep propensity were recorded. Mice were either deprived during the day or the night, then their homeostatic sleep recorded for 24 hours. The sleep propensity marker in stress-susceptible mice was blunted when compared to stress-naïve/resilient mice after daytime-sleep deprivation. Night-deprived mice showed similar sleep-propensity response during the day as day-deprived mice. Our data concludes that sleep deprivation during the night alters proportions of REM sleep in stress-susceptible mice most notably, with REM sleep decreasing during the night and increasing during the day compared to the other phenotypes.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Recent research has shown that many of these mutations cause aggregation of p53 with its wild type form and other proteins in the pathway, resulting in loss of ability to arrest the cell cycle and induce apoptosis. alpha-helix mimetics have been shown to inhibit amyloid aggregation of Ab and IAPP, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes, respectively. Here, we show that ADH-6 acts as a potent, specific mutant p53 inhibitor that can abrogate p53 aggregates and rescue its function in pancreatic carcinoma. Rescued p53 recovers its cellular functions, particularly cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Overall, the study shows that A-beta inhibitors can target p53 aggregation, suggesting similarities between the self-assembly processes of these proteins.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

To elucidate the putative connections between temperature rhythmicity and depression, core body temperature was recorded using wireless telemetry in stress-naïve, resilient and susceptible mice exposed to chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), a rodent model of depression-like behaviour. RT-qPCR was used to measure the expression of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP), a temperature-sensitive gene which acts as a circadian regulator. Levels of Clock and Per1 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), lateral habenula (LHb) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) were also assessed as they are downstream targets of CIRP. Amplitude of temperature rhythms was blunted more severely in susceptible mice. As a result, CIRP was only up-regulated in susceptible mice, leading to loss of CIRP rhythmicity in the SCN and LHb. These initial findings suggest that rhythms in temperature and CIRP expression could be used as markers of mood disorders.	</p><p>Author proviced keywords:

The response to unfolded protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is critical to cellular homeostasis and mediated by the unfolded protein response (UPR). Chronic UPR induction is maladaptive and known to cause diseases. Steatosis is the accumulation of lipid droplets in hepatocytes, and while not pathological, steatosis is a requisite for the more severe steatohepatitis. I leveraged models of steatosis in zebrafish to further understand if the microbiome could influence the UPR. There was no significant impact of the germ-free rearing on ER structure or steatosis severity in stressed hepatocytes. To assess lipid accumulation and its influence on the UPR, I used a transgenic zebrafish line overexpressing the lipid droplet protein Perilipin-2 in hepatocytes (Tg(fabp10a:EGFP-hPLIN2)). Lipid droplet accumulation was significantly higher in Perilipin-2 zebrafish compared to wild-type controls. Overexpression of Perilipin-2 also reduced the incidence of aberrant ER morphology. This supports the conclusion that stabilization of lipid droplets by Perilipin-2 protects against ER deformity in the liver.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Efforts to develop novel therapeutic drugs and an effective vaccine are hampered by considerable inter-patient variation, which is still poorly understood due to an overall lack of understanding of the host immune response to infection. Here, we developed experimental procedures adapted for PBMC samples collected in the field in Africa and performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on matched samples from four children before and after symptomatic P. falciparum infection to determine how malaria shapes the landscape of circulating immune cells during blood-stage malaria. Twelve immune cell types were identified based on classical gene markers. Matched individual-level analysis revealed significant inter-individual variation. Together, these results strongly suggest that inter-individual variation in the symptomology of malaria originates from variable alterations in both innate and adaptive cells in response to infection. Furthermore, the datasets generated will serve as foundational scRNA-seq PBMC maps of malarial children for future studies of host immune response in malaria.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Cells have therefore developed a complex defense mechanism, known as the DNA Damage Response/Repair (DDR) pathway, in order to detect and repair these damages. While various proteins have been identified as key players in the DDR pathway, a complete understanding of the pathway is still elusive, suggesting the involvement of as yet unidentified additional proteins. Here, we report for the very first time that Microtubule Associated Protein 4 (MAP4), which was thought to be cytoplasmic and only involved in regulation of intracellular transport by promoting microtubule polymerization and stability, is a nuclear protein that interacts with key players of the DDR pathway upon induction of double-strand DNA breaks. Further, we show that over-expression of its microtubule binding domain leads to a faster recovery from DNA damage. Our findings place MAP4 at the hub of the DNA repair pathway, which may hold key to further understanding of the DDR mechanisms. Understanding the DNA repair pathway may provide novel therapeutic approaches to alleviating the risk of disorders caused by DNA damage.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Experiments with brain tissues from neurodegenerative disease patients found increased oxidative DNA damage in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in these tissues, alluding to a potential role of NM1 in the disease etiology. We aimed to identify the connection between NM1 and common neurodegenerative diseases by generating NM1 KO cell lines from primary MEFs. We found an over-representation of genes related to neurodegenerative disease and oxidative phosphorylation in GO analyses. While most nuclear-encoded genes were down-regulated in the KO cells, a few were up-regulated along with some genes encoded in mitochondria. CRISPR-generated NM1 KO cells exhibited a smaller amount of OXPHOS subunits compared to the WT, but also showed an increase in both ATP and hydrogen peroxide levels. GO analysis on those CRISPR NM1 KO cells reveals an over-representation of genes related to axon guidance and neurogenesis, indicating that NM1 might be implicated in other neuronal development processes.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Due to the limited number of studies on arterial stiffness in the region, this study investigates the epidemiology of arterial stiffness in the UAE population, using augmentation index (AIx) as a surrogate measure. Baseline descriptive statistics were calculated for 3,856 Emiratis aged ≥18 years. The analysis identified sex, blood pressure measurements and cholesterol as large drivers of variation in the data and found that females and older aged individuals had significantly higher average AIx values than males. AIx positively correlated with blood pressure measurements, smoking, anthropometric measures and CRP in both males and females, yet variations in relationships and correlations did exist across sex. These sex-differences as well as the accelerated vascular aging identified in aging females compared to males suggests that different mechanisms may be underlying arterial stiffness between males and females.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Cardiovascular Disease, UAE Healthy Future Study, UAEHFS, Arterial Stiffness</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c90ac16532f1a0a2f5c8c1e3b0708a49" level="file"><did><unittitle>Annan-Mills, Felicia Lankai. <emph render="italic">Systems Level Metabolic Characterization of Sickle Cell Disease Using Computational Models of Red Blood Cells</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0073</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_6bd6c47681d5b57954301bdae34bd1ec" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_6bd6c47681d5b57954301bdae34bd1ec" type="Folder">2021-0073</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_80ae45c2ea1eb45995a105eb12202d08"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a heritable hemoglobinopathy caused by a point mutation in the β-globin protein of the tetrameric hemoglobin protein resulting in the sickle-shaped RBC.

This study generated constraint-based models of RBC based on a baseline iDEA-RBC-1494 model to characterize the metabolic phenotype in SCD and healthy controls. The iDEA-RBC-1494 model is a 5-fold expansion in the number of genes of a previously published iAB-RBC-283 model using Recon 3D and the latest RBC proteomic dataset. In silico perturbations to non-trivial metabolic reactions in our SCD model resulted in the prediction of potential drugs that could rescue the SCD phenotype. Bioenergetic analysis resulted in the identification of target reactions, which we used to query the Drug Gene Interaction Database for potential drugs. We identify candidate drugs that revert the SCD bioenergetic phenotype and which can be evaluated further for the clinical treatment of SCD.

Previous studies have shed light on the impact of post-transcriptional regulation and host genetic control of miRNA expression during malaria infection. Here, we generated miRNA profiles of children from two sympatric ethnic groups with varying levels of susceptibility to malaria in Burkina Faso (Mossi and Fulani) during natural P. falciparum infection and assessed interethnic differences in their miRNA transcriptomes at multiple levels. The results of my study highlight variation in post-transcriptional regulation and ethnic-specific effects of host genotype on miRNA expression as potential mechanisms driving interethnic differences in host susceptibility and immune response to malaria.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Malaria, miRNA, Genetics, Integrative Genomics, Interethnic Analysis, Host Immunity, Infection</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2b10a188142abd1a63ea6a4767de3bea" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chua, Anthony. <emph render="italic">Studies on the Role of β‐actin in Expression of the Long Noncoding RNA Meg3, and Its Potential Impact on Cell Identity</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0070</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_e809ca7c6f031054ce14c83776bd2472" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e809ca7c6f031054ce14c83776bd2472" type="Folder">2021-0070</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b40b407988497b106b0e24772c329174"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Differentiation occurs through activating and repressing various gene programs towards a given cell identity, done in part by regulating chromatin states using chromatin modifiers, some of which use long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). β‐actin is also important in differentiation, regulating chromatin and overall gene expression, like as part of certain chromatin remodelers. This study used RNA-seq, ChIRP-seq on the lncRNA Meg3, and ChIP-seq for the Meg3-interacting chromatin remodeler Prc2, on wild-type and β‐actin depleted mouse embryonic  fibroblasts. With β‐actin loss: several lncRNAs were differentially expressed, including Meg3; Meg3 occupancy changed across specific chromosomal locations, impacting expression of several genes related to differentiation; and no differentially expressed genes shared Meg3 and Ezh2 occupancies. Overall, both expression and genomic deposition of Meg3 are β‐actin-dependent. Also, Meg3 genomic association is likely mediated in an β-actin-dependent manner through mechanisms independent from the Prc2 complex. These alterations likely impact expression of genes involved in cell fate. </p><p>Author provided keywords: actin pluripotency differentiation chromatin lncRNA Meg3 Prc2</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bce74971e134b255b4900f0d83e15372" level="file"><did><unittitle>Doubi, Meni Guissouegou. <emph render="italic">The Transcriptional Role of Nuclear Myosin 1 During Neurogenesis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0077</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_cad5f4455d7750871c97c2db57d39bbb" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_cad5f4455d7750871c97c2db57d39bbb" type="Folder">2021-0077</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d278491510ca2f5d18a00e31398d3b19"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Previous studies have shown that cytoskeletal proteins regulate and maintain chromatin organization and gene regulation. Nuclear Myosin 1 (NM1) as a part of the BWICH multiprotein transcriptional complex is involved in the regulation of gene transcription and DNA integrity. Regulation and coordination of the chromatin are crucial for the activation of specific gene programs during differentiation. Given that NM1 is involved in transcriptional complexes, NM1 could also be potentially involved in regulating differentiation. This study aims to investigate the transcriptional role of NM1 in neuronal differentiation. Using a small chemicals cocktail we transdifferentiated Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) to neurons and found that neuronal specific genes in MEFs were mostly downregulated in the absence of NM1. Further, we investigated the impact of NM1 in neurons by observing the change in morphology during the neuronal induction period. Through RTqPCR and immunofluorescence, we assessed the differences in neuronal expression levels in presence and absence of NM1. Our results showed that in absence of NM1, neurons tend to have a higher survival rate and different morphology. The loss of NM1 resulted in irregular axon connections, an increase in dendrites, and a potential delayal in differentiation or potential formation of oligodendrocytes.</p><p>Author provided keywords: differentiation, neurons, neurogenesis, nuclear myosin 1, cytoskeleton, transcription, chromatin, genome</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6f4c81553f2ad4cd5b369086372011e5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Falis, Marcin. <emph render="italic">Understanding the Evolutionary Dynamics of the Major Histocompatibility Complex in Ethiopian Grass Frogs</emph> </unittitle><unitid>2021-0076</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_9ca002601c86382b2735804493095c34" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9ca002601c86382b2735804493095c34" type="Folder">2021-0076</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_44ee4f34aae3ee1fabb155f0fd032580"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Understanding the evolutionary landscape of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) lays at the core of immunology and has strong implications for conservation. The latter claim is particularly true in the case of amphibians, an understudied vertebrate class that remains severely impacted by emerging infectious diseases. Here, I investigated the evolutionary dynamics of the classical MHC genes in the grass frogs of genus Ptychadena that are endemic to one of the world's biodiversity hotspots – the Ethiopian Highlands. Using intra- and inter-specific whole-genome resequencing datasets, I conducted phylogenetic inference, selection tests, and population genetics analysis to characterize the evolutionary forces that shaped the evolution of the classical MHC genes. The results revealed characteristic signatures of balancing selection, such as excess of nonsynonymous polymorphisms and above-average nucleotide diversity, amongst the MHC class I loci, whereas the patterns of diversity at class II loci were not consistent with balancing selection. The signals at the class I loci point towards recent balancing selection, which did not result in trans-specific polymorphisms. Based on the conducted analysis, I discuss several challenges related to using low-coverage resequencing data for studies of the MHC, which may aid in the execution of similar studies in the future.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Major Histocompatibility Complex, MHC genes, Balancing Selection, Ptychadena, Anurans, Amphibians</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_afb5e0c098ae23dbd17df9969ab28969" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hau, Sion Delores. <emph render="italic">Investigating the Transcriptional Landscape of Dendritic Cells in 3D Culture</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0081</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_2df1c2e7bdc4fc36007c1f2daa1f938b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_2df1c2e7bdc4fc36007c1f2daa1f938b" type="Folder">2021-0081</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e75873dab343557a4e0ca88f1194926e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Monocyte derived dendritic cells (DCs) play an essential role in bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses through their efficient antigen presenting abilities. They have recently been shown to exhibit enhanced immune potency when differentiated and activated on 3D collagen matrices compared to traditional 2D cell culture environments. However, the transcriptional immune response of DCs differentiated and matured on various scaffolding remained unexplored. This study investigated the transcriptomic differences of DCs differentiated and activated on 3D collagen matrices with a DESeq2 analysis pipeline in an aim to provide insight into the transcriptional regulation and mechanisms behind the previously observed increase in immune potency. The findings revealed that the 3 mg/ml collagen concentration provided a supportive microenvironment for the differentiation and activation of DCs with antigen-specific cellular response transcriptional pathways activated. The same specific immune response pathways failed to be activated in DCs cultured in traditional 2D cell culture plates. Most unexpectedly, the 1 mg/ml collagen matrix was found to prematurely activate mDC-like transcriptional level immune responses in the absence of maturation factors, possibly suggesting a mechanosensitivty of DCs to soft substratum mimicking wound tissue.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Transcriptome, Dendritic Cells, 3D Culture, mechanobiology, collagen scaffolding, Deseq2</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f7a0cc063b3838b0374e22b3c981b477" level="file"><did><unittitle>Howarth, Madeline. <emph render="italic">Prion protein-derived cell-penetrating peptide inhibits type II diabetes-associated islet amyloid polypeptide aggregation and cytotoxicity</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0075</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_4afa081027925e0ed3c91e9010c5d84e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_4afa081027925e0ed3c91e9010c5d84e" type="Folder">2021-0075</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2679602926d64a680571d2faa6198e24"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Amyloid diseases are conditions including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease whose pathologies are caused by the mis-folding and aggregation of one of many amyloid proteins. This in turn results in toxic gain of function (GoF) and cell death. One such amyloid protein is islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), whose aggregation and toxic GoF is implicated in the loss of beta cells associated with type II diabetes. As in other amyloid diseases, there is currently a dearth of therapeutics aimed at addressing IAPP aggregation and cytotoxicity. In this study, we test the efficacy of a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) composed of the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the prion protein (PrP) conjugated to the signal sequence of neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM) against IAPP aggregation and toxic GoF. This construct has already been shown to be effective against the amyloid (A) peptide, which is implicated in Alzheimer's disease.

P. falciparum malaria afflicts children unpredictably with high levels of symptomatic variability during the blood development stage of the parasite life cycle. Investigating the natural dynamic variation in transcriptional response of both the human host and Plasmodium parasite has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms that drive inter-individual variability in host immune response at the transcriptional level. This study presents an optimized experimental and bioinformatic approach for dual RNA sequencing of the human host and P. falciparum parasites using blood samples collected from a symptomatic malarial African pediatric cohort. The procedure generates a quantitative readout of host-parasite transcriptomes. The host-parasite transcriptional data was used to identify cross-correlated host-parasite transcripts and transcripts associated with parasitemia. This study lays the foundation for population-scale integrative joint transcriptomic analysis of in vivo host-parasite interactions and provides data and tools to apply in the context of other infectious diseases to elucidate the complex architecture of host-pathogen interactions at the transcriptional level.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Dual RNASequencing, malaria, plasmodium, co-transcriptome</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d1023b5630185df14c86effed93a390d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mic, Eliza. <emph render="italic">Neural Encoding of Thermal Stimulation</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0072</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_24c7137787439f89e98e4f9ec71cbd9f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_24c7137787439f89e98e4f9ec71cbd9f" type="Folder">2021-0072</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_aa8a69a105a27995593590712b7cc7b0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Thermal stimulation and perception has been explored in several studies through self-reports (Filingeri et al., 2014; El Ali et al., 2020; Watanabe et al. 2014) and positron emission  tomography (PET) (Craig et al. 2000).

In the current study, four different  temperature stimuli were delivered to 15 healthy participants and their brain activity was measured using EEG. We found the P200 ERP component in the middle frontal cortex and the central parietal cortex and the P100 ERP component in the occipital cortex. Interestingly, in the middle frontal and the central parietal cortices, the highest temperature (41°C) had the lowest activation compared to the lowest temperature (23°C), while, in the occipital cortex, the activation for the two conditions was inverted.

Chemotherapy has many limitations: multidrug resistance, poor solubility, and lack of targeting specificity. Nanoparticles as a delivery vehicle for chemotherapeutics have been shown to have increased in-blood circulation, biocompatibility, and targeting specificity. Moreover, a promising line of research known as immune checkpoint therapy inhibits the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction between cancer cells and immune cells. This approach has shown promising and more long-lasting results as it potentiates the immune system. Therefore, this project combined these two lines of research and developed a doxorubicin-loaded, lipid-coated, PD-L1 inhibitor and active targeting peptide-conjugated mesoporous silica nanoplatform that aimed to treat cancers that over express PD-L1. Cell viability MTS assays showed that the loaded nanoparticles were more toxic to MIA PaCa-2 cells than doxorubicin alone.

This led us to investigate differences in mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics in WT and NM1 KO MEFs. We report NM1 KO cells to have lowered expression of OXPHOS genes and dysregulated mitochondrial metabolites. Absence of functional NM1 in cells is also associated with decreased mitochondrial mass, perinuclear mitochondrial distribution, and underdeveloped mitochondrial morphology. Overall, our results suggest NM1 KO MEFs to resemble a mitochondrial phenotype similar to that of rapidly proliferating cells such as Stem Cells.

Lactose and maltose appeared to readily crystallize and effectively protect GFP against denaturation, and gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results showed lactose including hemagglutinin and protecting it from denaturation.

Our group succeeded in simultaneously assembling three remarkable zinc-based complexes in water: the 2-catenane ([2]C), trefoil knot (TK), and Solomon link (SL). TK is interesting because of its cavity that can recognize a wide range of anions.

Despite the many recent advances, the dynamics of complex systems operating on long timescales still evades researchers due to the high computational demand. We developed a suite of programs to study biological processes across a range of timescales using short trajectories, providing a coarse-grained representation of relevant conformational states. This method was applied to two systems: (1) the rapid ion incorporation conformation in HIV Reverse Transcriptase; and, (2) the complex conformational transition of the Hammerhead-like ribozyme. Using only a one-dimensional reaction coordinate, ion incorporation was found to be a spontaneous and favorable process, with a free energy change of -3.37 kcal/mol. The structural switch mechanism of the Hammerhead-like ribozyme was also discovered in atomic detail, using both a low- and multi-dimensional configuration space definition. This higher-dimensional partitioning was shown to reliably describe the complexity of the system, but was found to be subject to poorer statistical convergence. Further development of this method may unlock new insights into the structure and dynamics of complex biological processes.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_07988d7f3808c0dec8b5ebc1162e37bf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dho, Yaereen. <emph render="italic">Synthesis of Triphenylphosphine-modified Gold Nanoparticles for an Effective Cytotoxic System to Cancer Cells</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0097</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_fd90a2a11cbeae2be6110a204201f91f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_fd90a2a11cbeae2be6110a204201f91f" type="Folder">2018-0097</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c0a136d2ca340dd68214379112221267"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We developed a green and innovative synthetic route for gold nanoparticles, surface coated with therapeutic agent triphenylphosphine (TPP) and stabilized with Pluronic F-108 polymer (F-108@TPP-AuNPs) for an effective cytotoxic system to cancer cells.

One synergistic pathway is through biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)—a phytohormone—by diatom-associated bacteria from diatom-secreted tryptophan that triggers nutrient exchanges between both taxa. The role of other phytohormones in diatom-bacteria interactions remains largely unknown. Here, several strains of bacteria associated with the cosmopolitan bloom-forming diatom Asterionellopsis glacialis were isolated and cultivated to establish the roles phytohormones play in diatom physiology. IAA alone did not enhance the growth of A. glacialis, but did so in combination with two other phytohormones, gibberellic acid and kinetin. Analyzing the metabolomes of F5, F10, and F28 using UHPLC-Q-ToF-MS showed that out of 74 known phytohormones, auxins, jasmonates, and a cytokinin were produced by all associated bacteria, with higher auxin production in F5 and higher jasmonate production in F10 and F28. These results suggest that a unique combination of hormones may enhance the diatom growth and that, in a complex microbiome, multiple phytohormone production by one or more bacteria, could cooperatively regulate or initiate diatom growth.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4edf5eec191785c01235f952d13012f6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gambrill, Yumi. <emph render="italic">Purification and structural elucidation of a thiazole-based molecule from Cleome rupicola fruits exhibiting antioxidant and potential anticataract activity</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0088</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_4acb2e502f05aea8bbee3078f8fce33c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_4acb2e502f05aea8bbee3078f8fce33c" type="Folder">2018-0088</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_27c98c261fc3a0c28d934cded768d7f7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p><emph render="italic">No Abstract</emph></p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0b02510e6203e546081b69d016c2710e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Henning, Anna. <emph render="italic">Optimising Photolabile Protecting Groups for Incorporation into Biological Probes</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0083</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_21c636ea9fb33620a20d8defa3d60a35" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_21c636ea9fb33620a20d8defa3d60a35" type="Folder">2018-0083</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4a44f1b3b7813f9d7eaeac8b9bf9f323"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Understanding physiological processes is vital for scientific advancement in many areas, from disease control to technological developments. While much progress has been made, particularly with the help of bioimaging techniques, a full knowledge of human physiology remains distant. To narrow the gap in knowledge, there is a need to develop more biological probes for studying the dynamic nature of physiological processes. Using light-dependent probes is effective as they provide tight control of the timing and location of events. In this category, photolabile protecting groups (PPGs) are of particular interest because of their simplicity of use. PPGs activated through the simultaneous absorption of two photons are especially useful for investigations in whole animals. However, the lack of PPGs activated by absorption of two photons is an impediment to their use. This project aims to optimise the 8-cyano-7-hydroxyquinolinyl PPG for higher sensitivity to two-photon absorption.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c36a49d680480cd6b4ea9546dd247b30" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jahovic, Ilma.  <emph render="italic">Rapid and Efficient Removal of Perfluorooctanoic Acid from Water with Fluorine-Rich Calixarene-Based Porous Polymers</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0091</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_d7fa239e05a800f7e67275ae233a25c6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d7fa239e05a800f7e67275ae233a25c6" type="Folder">2018-0091</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_52ab1984d9a52de7d969565d10fc5dae"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Because of its non-biodegradable nature and persistence in the environment, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) accumulates in water resources and poses serious environmental issues in many parts of the world. Adsorption is the most frequently used water decontamination method but the common drawbacks of adsorbents used (e.g. activated carbon) include low adsorption capacity, limited regeneration ability, and slow pollutant uptake. Here, we present the development of two fluorine-rich calix[4]arene-based porous polymers, FCX4-P and FCX4-BP, and demonstrate their potential utility for the removal of PFOA from water. FCX4-P removes ~99% of PFOA at environmentally relevant concentrations with higher affinity than the commercial activated carbon and with comparable kinetics. Given the structural and chemical versatility of porous polymers containing the calixarene macrocycle in their backbone, our findings herald the advent of a new generation of materials that can be successfully used for water purification.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b1df4212823496377872c127d6de5512" level="file"><did><unittitle>Moussa, Yasmine. <emph render="italic">Chemical Screen Exploring the Role of mel-28 Nucleoporin Gene in C. elegans and its Potential Connection to Cancer Therapy</emph>

The MEL-28 protein in C. elegans (ELYS in vertebrates) is a NUP with numerous essential cell cycle functions that are conserved in humans, including a role in DNA replication licensing. Zebrafish Elys mutants are highly sensitized to treatment with DNA replication inhibitors such as Cisplatin, suggesting that MEL-28 could be used as a cancer therapy target. To test this hypothesis, we characterized a C. elegans mel-28 thermosensitive mutant strain and screened the Spectrum Collection small molecule library to identify chemicals that cause enhancement in a mel-28 sensitized background. We identified seven compounds that specifically enhance mel-28, some of which are known to affect microtubules. We then tested whether the selected compounds act in a synergistic way with Cisplatin in the mel-28(ts) and wildtype genetic backgrounds and observed synergism with three compounds specifically in the mel-28(ts) strain. Interestingly, one of them, Mitotane, is already used in combinatorial drug therapy with Cisplatin in patients with adrenal carcinoma, thus providing proof of concept for our experimental approach. Our results confirm MEL-28/ELYS as a candidate chemotherapy drug target, establish C. elegans mel-28 as a model for identifying new cancer drugs, and demonstrate that known chemicals could potentially be repurposed for combinatorial chemotherapy. Finally, we identified compounds not previously described to affect wild-type worms that could provide leads for new broad-spectrum anthelmintics.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3fb382fb544ea2d596a5675b282df972" level="file"><did><unittitle>Boutros, Sandra Emad. <emph render="italic">Crown-ether Calix[4]arene Porous Organic Polymer for Lithium Enrichment</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0078</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e7acf7ccb7b69e6bb92d3b57f8bb6110" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e7acf7ccb7b69e6bb92d3b57f8bb6110" type="Folder">2019-0078</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3a90587a767481239d3b2134c5a1d557"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Because of the premature depletion of lithium resources due to the extensive battery production, extracting it from various and uncommon resources is a vital need to maintain a growing industry of electric devices and vehicles.

C-CX4P shows a remarkable lithium uptake capacity of 941.69 mg g −1.   In addition, both polymers exhibit specificity to lithium in the presence of competitive sodium ion in excess, such that a 0% removal of sodium is obtained for CP-CX4P. These preliminary results demonstrate the potential use of carefully designed porous organic polymers as a new generation of materials which can be used for lithium adsorption from various sources.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_dcc639dcd0ef2b6a07140937e012d81c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Faisal, Tabinah. <emph render="italic">Spectroscopic study of the interactions between asphaltenes and prospective scale inhibitors in solution</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0113</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_00b8a9f6fd229d16479d0b7c7ad9cc9c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_00b8a9f6fd229d16479d0b7c7ad9cc9c" type="Folder">2019-0113</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cdebd7af00a828a59a3038e912830245"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Asphaltene precipitation, which leads to asphaltene deposition, has proven to be highly catastrophic for the oil industry. Scale inhibitors, chemical inhibitors which can prevent the formation of asphaltene deposits in oil wells and pipelines, are of particular interest. The scale inhibitors currently in use have low efficacy and several shortcomings, which increases the need to extend research into novel chemicals. In this study, we test various aromatic inhibitors with different functional moieties. Fluorescence studies and Hill analysis demonstrated that inhibitors X3 and Y3, which were surfactant-like with strongly acidic and electron-withdrawing moieties, showed the lowest dissociation constants (Kd) over time and across different sources of asphaltenes. These inhibitors showed the highest affinity to different types of asphaltene molecules and are, therefore, most likely to form complexes with asphaltenes, preventing them from further aggregating. Additionally, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) analysis revealed that inhibitor X3 was able to remove 70% of the adsorbed mass of asphaltenes from carbon steel, which mimics actual surfaces in oil wells and pipelines. The results indicate that aromatic inhibitors with acidic and electron-withdrawing moieties are good scale inhibitor candidates; they can be effective in interacting with asphaltenes and potentially preventing them from aggregating further.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7b5c4cf098c5eff5ee57ee5ca0c29e05" level="file"><did><unittitle>Knyazeva, Anastassiya. <emph render="italic">Investigation of relationship between material properties and self-healing in crystals of boronic esters and disulfides</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0113</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_9a069256a23bfd006813ca085e4080d0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9a069256a23bfd006813ca085e4080d0" type="Folder">2019-0113</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0f186218ff169805f30c1c75521dd3f0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Degradation and loss of integrity are among the biggest shortcomings of materials that are exposed to mechanical impact.

In this project we aimed to examine the relationship between mechanical properties and the self-healing on the examples of selected boronic esters and disul-fides, the Young's modulus and stiffness were measured for selected crystals and the self-healing experiment was attempted. Var-ious issues such as hydrolysis, fracturing during manipulation and the solvent encapsulation within the crystal limited the assess-ment of self-healing for several crystals.

The human hexokinase 3 (HK3) is not significantly overexpressed in tumors. However, biochemical differences in HK2 and HK3 could be exploited in improving the potency and specificity of current HK2 inhibitors. Here, we report the thermodynamic characterization of HK3. Experimental results reveal that both the melting temperature and calorimetric enthalpy change of wild-type HK3 are higher than for HK2.

This is due to the fact thatPDFs do not conform to any conventions in terms of document structure and that PDF generators tend to use different rules for assembling the documents. A solution that can allow users to retrieve structured information from a document in a form that is easily manipulated can have a noticeable positive impact for professionals across a broad spectrum of industries.The framework put forward in this paper,Texture, uses diverse heuristic techniques in order to extract structural elements (lists, titles, headers and footers, paragraphs, figures and tables) fromPDFs. They are assigned different weights that lead to robust and accurate extractors.Texture also introduces a domain specific language that allows users to query documents using natural language.We demonstrate that Texture has potential to perform as well as the manual labeling process while being much easier to use than any labor crowdsourcing platform. Texture is also cheaper, quicker, and more scalable than hiring crowd workers to handle the same extraction tasks.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_42b6c41ce03d205cc07c8071cd472f5e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ahmad, Muaz; Dana Abu Ali, Hayat Al Hassan, Ming Hu, Paula Dozsa. <emph render="italic">Time-offset Interaction Application</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0101</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_c4f39b49fdc2872a72d9be3d8a5923e0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c4f39b49fdc2872a72d9be3d8a5923e0" type="Folder">2018-0101</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b866d53e02578e59b1789bbe3c225d6d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper presents a bilingual (Arabic-English) interactive human avatar dialogue system.

Public figures, news channels, and sports event with followers numbered in millions receive up to a million views in their livestreams and the number is  growing. The current broadcasting infrastructures rely on large and expensive networks of media servers and edge caches that are distributed around the globe to maintain network efficiency, quality, and reliability. In this paper, we present Esfera, a light-weight, scalable, peer-to-peer live video broadcasting infrastructure  that utilizes the potentials of WebRTC, a set of APIs that allows ultra-low latency browser-to-browser communication without external plugins. Commercial platforms such as Facebook Messenger, and Google Hangouts have successfully tested and deployed their VoIP services on WebRTC, and broadcasting is the next  milestone in the success of WebRTC. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of the design and implementation of Esfera and present an evaluation of its performance. Finally, we discuss the limitations and future challenges that are posed by peer-to-peer live broadcasting using WebRTC.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_eb8aeb703997e626ac18808ed5fce3b9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hopkins, Brooke. <emph render="italic">Insulin Pump Vulnerabilities and Design for Secure Device Communication</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0073</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_28eec66435d1a5b86e445017238053fe" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_28eec66435d1a5b86e445017238053fe" type="Folder">2018-0073</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_98e6b29a3d4cb224c29984efb185de82"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Advanced health technology promises to bring considerable advances to patient care. However, there are great security risks which can have disastrous health consequences. Several studies show that implantable medical devices (IMDs) have vulnerabilities enabling man in the middle attacks that could disclose patient data or even inflict patient harm. Insulin delivery systems, which are commonly used IMDs, are vulnerable for this reason. All communication between the continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and the insulin pump is unencrypted, and protective PINs are passed in plain text. While there is existing research that documents this vulnerability and proposes solutions, these provide only suggestions for device modification that could be implemented by the manufacturer in future models. In this paper, we propose a design for a fully backwards compatible external device that ensures authenticity and integrity of communication between the CGM and the insulin pump. The design employs friendly jamming techniques to provide access control by jamming unauthenticated communication.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_50e1874a6579fc1b7e381ba95353f04b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jensen, Frederik. <emph render="italic">On Problems Related to Epsilon-Nets</emph>

We contribute to the literature by improving the bounds for several simple cases.

We also obtain tight bounds for all k-sided objects in the dual setting for nets of size 1, and a tight bound of 2/3 for nets of size 2 with respect to halfspaces. We show the two following elegant results: Given a set of points and a set of disks in the plane, if every three disks intersect in a common
 input point, then two of those points hit all disks; and, given a set of points and a set of halfspaces in the plane, if every three points belongs to a halfspace then two halfspaces cover all points.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_a32409056c6442d3a2e1fc56da0f1af8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Joshi, Aadi. <emph render="italic">Epsilon-nets and related problems</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0067</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_fe065d30f8a742da65bec2530bfc220a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_fe065d30f8a742da65bec2530bfc220a" type="Folder">2018-0067</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_097c00f47ee0be1db8c340ee010d076a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Given a family of geometric objects S and a set of points P, we would like to prove that all object s in S that contain more than a certain fraction, epsilon, of points in P, can be hit by a small number of points in a set called the epsilon-net. By this we mean that if an object s in S contains more than a fraction epsilon of the points in P, then the object must also contain one or more of the points in the epsilon-net. In this capstone paper, we explore a variety of problems related to epsilon-nets. We improve the bounds on epsilon for disks and half-spaces when the epsilon-net contains 2 points. We also improve the bounds for disks and half-spaces for dual epsilon-nets. There are two additional proofs we provide related to hitting sets. We prove that if every three points is contained in a half-plane, then two half-planes must cover all points. We also prove that if every three disks intersect at a point, then two points hit all disks.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1e5604856629a9bd65dae788b6d4a1d1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chen, Wei Peter; Shehroze Khan, Jihyun Kim, Tarik Zulfikarpasic. <emph render="italic">Qutr: A Cross-lingual Messenger with Keyword Searchable Phrases for the Travel Domain</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0089</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_74e3a17cba74b3c88847f7dab58c4987" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_74e3a17cba74b3c88847f7dab58c4987" type="Folder">2018-0089</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9d7cf2a671cdd236b80fbb57fdad6c2e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We present Qutr (Query Translator), a smart cross-lingual communication application for the travel domain.

The main problem in the domain is that classification requires uniform data with accurate labels, but online collected image datasets can not provide pose, illumination or resolution invariance and the assigned labels have a high error rate. We surveyed the current state-of-the-art methods in generating face representations from online datasets, and tested them with noise resistant machine learning architectures. We applied the findings on a dataset of 30 million images to aid research at Princeton University on racial discrimination in career progression in corporate structures. Our final architecture: From the input images we generate low level face representations using the Openface neural network to overcome the invariance in our dataset. These representations are then fed into a base neural network which has a denoising layer attached to it that attempts to correct the error in the labels. Our approach reached 0.79 f1-score on the FERET dataset. The novelty of the project is two-fold: it adds to our understanding of machine learning under noisy conditions, and proposes a computationally efficient approach to classify millions of faces.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0df2aa5057c5ed229900cda676d156df" level="file"><did><unittitle> Mirza, Muhammad Shujaat. <emph render="italic">Reimagining Privacy in Online Social Networks</emph>

While the privacy of current postings has been the subject of multiple research groups, the re-evaluation of the privacy settings for these posts down the line is a new area of interest for people. In regard to recent episodes such as the Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal, discussions have revolved around the value we associate with the old postings. Whereas different platforms try to offer options to have some control over the accessibility of our information, their effectiveness relies on the extent to which users understand those options. Through this study, we aim to explore the relation between user's perception of their profile privacy settings and their actual settings. Our study, based on the participant pool of 91, reports that there is a significant mismatch between the actual exposure to the posts versus the user's perception of the privacy settings. We also investigate the impact old postings can have on friend circle expansion. The findings show how the aged information, relevant or irrelevant, finds a way to influence the user's behavior in the current context.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9eb450ed2bba2cde094e153afe472c46" level="file"><did><unittitle>Moore, Megan. <emph render="italic">Detection and Analysis of Devices Used to Censor Networks</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0060</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_ca92dabbaeca4b7776d10e57ddbe155d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_ca92dabbaeca4b7776d10e57ddbe155d" type="Folder">2018-0060</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_68607ba961685d85fc7a9c7d0a25dca8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This capstone sought to better understand the state of censorship in the world today.

Open PWLANs are now a standard part of the global Internet infrastructure and are becoming a standard in-flight amenity on many commercial airplanes. Public networks, including in-flight Wi-Fi hotspots, are typically implemented as open wireless hotspots with user authentication and connection control implemented via redirection of HTTP(S) traffic from unrecognized devices to a captive portal. In this paper, we describe an exploit in which captive portal networks are exposed to authentication bypassing by unauthorized, selfish clients. We then describe a spoofing detection and mitigation suite designed to protect PWLANs against this class of spoofing attacks. In the context of in-flight wireless networks, captive portal circumvention by unauthorized users is especially critical given the high latency, low bandwidth physical layer that this type of network relies upon. The ultimate goal of this paper is to outline the construction of a comprehensive spoofing attack defense mechanism.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_74b21e7e522372c1ade9862907caae9c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sharma, Prashant. <emph render="italic">Machine Learning technique for extraction of phase for the Indian monsoon intraseasonal oscillation (MISO)</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0078</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_c42c7111af859f9a8324de0bdd300320" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c42c7111af859f9a8324de0bdd300320" type="Folder">2018-0078</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_24f5ab6db4b93096409015112fa8bc03"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Climate scientists use methods of decomposition of Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) signal obtained through satellite imagery in terms of orthogonal basis functions which are determined from the data and find both time series and spatial patterns to construct Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillation (MISO) phases.

My attempts to train neural networks were unsuccessful.

Test data is also useful for demonstrating product features or for creating educational material. Since real data may be confidential or difficult to obtain and wrangle, engineers and researchers rely on synthetic data generators. Existing data generators may be platform or programming language specific, difficult to use, and may often generate unrealistic-looking data because they do not allow users to adequately customize inputs and generated data. We present Synner, a data generation tool which focuses primarily on usability. Synner allows users to sketch custom input data distributions and specify relationships or dependencies between fields. In the spreadsheet interface, users can select from a various data types, domains and functions and see a preview of records. Since ultimately data is generated probabilistically, it is imperative to communicate this uncertainty in probabilistic data generation to users. We perform a user study to determine visualization techniques to suitably communicate probabilistic uncertainty. We allow users to enter examples of data and generate data that matches these examples by inferring the type, distribution and proportion of the examples provided by the user.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f6281b39297fa7d6e566b731a8b39369" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ahmed, David. <emph render="italic">Combining Keystroke and Mouse Dynamics for Stronger and More Usable Authentication</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0075</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_cf30be83a1618b6aefdcc975a1fe6144" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_cf30be83a1618b6aefdcc975a1fe6144" type="Folder">2019-0075</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e57ffefe48998f87fd241e8ae12cb99b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Traditional approaches to strengthening authentication systems come in the form such as Multi-Factor authentication (MFA) schemes, One-Time-Passwords (OTP), new password policies, etc. Even though these measures tend to improve authentication methods in theory, they come at a huge cost in terms of usability and practical security. This project investigates and proposes a combined implementation of keystroke and mouse dynamics for increasing the usability of current authentication schemes by making authentication systems more intelligent and user-centric. Consequently, instead of blindly posing challenges to authenticators, our approach allows for the authentication system to make real-time decisions as to if there is a necessity for new challenges in the form of MFA or other forms of traditional approaches.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ccb65c667369487d8eafaa4e47138f1e" level="file"><did><unittitle> Al Dhaheri, Ali Saif Gharib Salem. <emph render="italic">Bulbul: An Online Application for Testing Arabic Dialect Knowledge</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0073</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_fefe19812cb594b35b74f67f06e1e584" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_fefe19812cb594b35b74f67f06e1e584" type="Folder">2019-0073</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b9b3489c2568d74c554a03cfb9a7e320"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>My project aims to educate native Arabic speakers as well as advanced non-native Arabic speakers on some of the basics of the numerous Arabic dialects through the use of a web application.

Finally, we also compare the results to that provided by the GNU Linear Programming Kit in order to see how close the heuristics came to what we consider the best possible solution.

The goal of the system is to infer recommendations for actions that medical staff should perform on a given patient. To achieve this, we find patients in similar conditions, and devise a number of strategies for recommending actions that should improve a patient's medical state. These recommendations are derived from the set of similar patients and a patient's most recent test results. Currently, our system is trained on data collected from ICU patients admitted for pneumonia. In the future, it can be extended to accommodate a variety of diseases. We compared our system against a random sampling of actions. Our highest-performing strategy yields a mean F-score of 0.417 after three days, outperforming the mean F-score of the random sampler by 0.150 (p-value 0.026).</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_82658dce9df4d3c913257cc5efa88cfd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chung, Christine. <emph render="italic">Gender Awareness and Modification in English-Arabic Machine Translation</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0086</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_44042374a8d51e4303f23bdd8465442c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_44042374a8d51e4303f23bdd8465442c" type="Folder">2019-0086</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d71590e617c4a7059e82820e8b8ea58d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The rapid development of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has increased awareness of some of the biases these systems have with regards to gender identities. Nearly half the world's languages are gender-dependent, yet current machine translation systems do not indicate the gender of the characters that appear in the translated phrases. This is largely due to the fact that they are built on gender ambiguous human-generated data which reflect social biases, as well as the fact that these systems are designed to give one output. Providing the system with access to user preferences is the ideal seamless solution; but giving the user clear alternatives to select from is a good alternative. We propose an approach to designing a gender-aware machine translation system through gender identification and gender translation that can be used together with any NLP application that generates text interfacing with users. We focus on English-Arabic sentence pairs in the first-person where the gender identity needs to be specified. We develop a first-of-its-kind gender-labeled corpus for training and evaluating first-person gender identification and gender translation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5a993997c039027a20079d1c69b17d25" level="file"><did><unittitle>Diugan, Raluca-Georgia, Guyu Fan, and Xin Tong. <emph render="italic">Timbre: A Decentralized Forum with Blockchain-based Distributed Data Store</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0125</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_a037ac845610fa0f34fc8a3b30c774d0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a037ac845610fa0f34fc8a3b30c774d0" type="Folder">2019-0125</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5741a5b4d38d74e111de816706429ce8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Much of the public discourse today takes place online on social media platforms. However, these platforms are typically subject to censorship because centralized storage of user content allows for monopoly of moderation power. For example, posts on Facebook and tweets on Twitter may be removed at will by the service providers, and threads on Reddit may be locked or deleted by subreddit moderators. In response to this issue, we design and implement Timbre, a Blockchain-based distributed data storage system for decentralized online forums. In Timbre, forum content is distributed to different nodes, and a blockchain that records the complete history of user data storage and transactions for data retrieval is propagated across the peer-to-peer (P2P) network. Ultimately, we aim to provide an open and censorship-resistant system for public online discourse.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3c2cfbe42374f8b9aefd66bdc002d747" level="file"><did><unittitle>Elsharkawi, Rayan. <emph render="italic">Understanding Money in the Digital Age: A Crypto-economic Investigation of Bitcoin Transaction Tips</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0126</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_6e5ff91b23f01856dd7260cc0ef51b2b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_6e5ff91b23f01856dd7260cc0ef51b2b" type="Folder">2019-0126</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0002236f8b97044b7d130d17b8fec85c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper aims to contribute to the limited literature on Bitcoin tips to better understand what technological constraints and monetary properties drive them; this would potentially ameliorate regulatory decisions and design considerations for government sponsored cryptocurrencies.

However, despite this, smartphone users are still facing major challenges. Access to the internet in these regions suffers from slow load times, poor performances, and limited opportunities dedicated to local content creation and diffusion. Therefore, there is no chance for relevant information to be easily distributed. For my computer Science capstone project, I have developed an Android mobile application, known as EMERGE, to enable the diffusion of locally produced content in emerging countries. It has a series of templates that members can use to efficiently publish content in the form of articles. These articles are organized into several categories that help members easily find information that is most relevant to their interests. The application has been tested in three communities in Central Mexico: Juriquilla, La Barreta, and Colon. Through behavior analysis and a feedback survey, data has been gathered, processed, and presented in this paper. We believe that the results have been generally positive with people praising the features of EMERGE. Nonetheless, there have been several suggestions to improve the application, which will be implemented in the near future.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9f3a224da827fcb363d53154cf5699c8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Seo, Simon. <emph render="italic">Lifting Squares to Half-spaces: a Specifi c Case of Lifting Pseudo-disks</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0097</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_a7075c04d24dfa18e57f39c4ec391b5e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a7075c04d24dfa18e57f39c4ec391b5e" type="Folder">2019-0097</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b15602f225876619542dd30cefd09cda"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A half-space in R3 is either of the two parts separated by a plane.

If such a mapping can be shown to exist, we attempt to provide a mathematical description of it or nd an algorithm that performs the mapping.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c475a4dddcc8a68e31d0dd734502b5ca" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tenev, Theodore. <emph render="italic">Connected Home Devices: IoT Standardization Efforts to Advance Interoperability and Business Intelligence</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0077</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_d083b066c18f788e1ccad661e6e4e8d3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d083b066c18f788e1ccad661e6e4e8d3" type="Folder">2019-0077</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_18acf6e5a6e981fd308d224e51b92a8b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>QLM is a whole-of-life lifecycle management technique which leverages the ability of devices to connect to the Internet of Things to extend traditional PLM to include detailed information about device state and usage in each stage of the product life. This report identifies and compares the emerging technical standards of data collection and communication between connected home devices in the ever-growing Internet of Things to support broad adoption of standardization efforts by the manufacturers of such devices. The report highlights the importance of technical specifications and open standards in the IoT industry, reviews and analyzes existing formal standards and frameworks by The Open Group, bIoTope, NIST, and W3C. The report gives recommendations for the creation of cross-industry, cross-platform and cross-organizational services by fostering interoperability and openness between manufacturers and within product categories, as well as highlights areas for further improvement and optimization of the existing efforts. Ultimately this research will contribute to the ideation and development of a set of capabilities for extracting business knowledge from the information streams provided by the devices in the Internet of Things, adapting the PLM approach for the IoT context.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c27e7a4ef7e2383685dee8502c1a7b27" level="file"><did><unittitle>Trejo, Alejandra. <emph render="italic">Digital Forgetting with Audience Awareness</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0080</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_f9dda1a40911829b4728976e05c298bd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f9dda1a40911829b4728976e05c298bd" type="Folder">2019-0080</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_690797653aeb67b9f3e70ae12e45fd78"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The content uploaded to social networks is only relevant for a limited amount of time. As a response to this, online Social Networks (OSNs) like Instagram and Snapchat have introduced features that  allows users content to be deleted after a predetermined amount of time. However, this system is inflexible as it only provides with one option for the amount of time a users content will be available online (24 hours). Other time-based revocation protocols have been proposed such as Neuralyzer which introduces the concept of flexible expiration times in which data is deleted based on different heuristics with one of them being drop of interest. None of these models account for the fact that users have different audiences in mind when they post content online which can range from close friends and family to the general public depending on the occasion. The aim of this capstone project is to create a time-based revocation model based on the drop of interest heuristic presented by Neuralyzer but that is also aware of the intended audience of the users content.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_121455a123f3f3e79ab94db0ae0003cb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Watanabe, Shunya. <emph render="italic">Supervised Segmentation of Electronic Dance Music </emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0115</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_c7c172b6b057759d6dec2b7b28ced429" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c7c172b6b057759d6dec2b7b28ced429" type="Folder">2019-0115</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2b387d9b66bc3d3a4d48213f46b0e2fd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this research, I provide a case study for the segmentation of Electronic Dance Music. First, the chroma feature is employed to obtain the harmonic content of a song. The information gained from the chroma feature is then used to construct the self-similarity matrix. Using the self-similarity matrix, the novelty curve is calculated. The data consist of fifty arbitrary chosen songs in the genres of Electronic Danice Music, including Big Room and Future House. For the sake of simplicity, all the songs have the beats per minute (bpm) of 128. The performance of the algorithm is determined by calculating its F1 score, and the implications of the research are discussed in the paper. Utilizing the algorithm, I created an interface for the DJs to efficiently make a playlist for their performance. The interface provides recommendations for the next song to play and when to mix. The recommendations are based on its bpm, energy level, and segment types. I believe that this will change the workflow of making the playlists for the DJs.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_af4b542d889cea7c4ddc30d3a5126c23" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cherevkov, Vlad. <emph render="italic">Analyzing JavaScript in Modern Webpages Using Machine Learning</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0060</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_8f07769b4128bd6d3ce86e74e7116f17" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_8f07769b4128bd6d3ce86e74e7116f17" type="Folder">2020-0060</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_40274372832154c3a1406d0c43c3f84e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Javascript is the most popular web-based programming language and is also unfortunately a major reason why the performance of modern web pages has been deteriorating. My main objective is to create the most accurate and robust machine learning classifier for third party JS scripts that will be deployable on a client system that does not have many available computational as well as disk resources. I focus on tree-based algorithms and, in particular, on performance differences between top bagging and boosting ensemble classifiers. The abundance of JS scripts used for tracking, advertising, beautification, and unnecessarily heavy content in the form of images or videos, put a heavy burden on users that lack either computational or internet data resources. By accurately identifying such scripts, the classifier was then successfully deployed in a two web-simplification focused pieces of software.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

This behaviour is detrimental to the progress of Artificial Intelligence because if humans are unwilling to cooperate with autonomous agents due to bias, then the usefulness of such agents is severely diminished. In an original controlled experiment, we will utilize a four-player iterated version of the public goods game to determine the extent to which humans are willing to cooperate with another participant who is labelled as a bot and whether that cooperation (or lack thereof) is based on the label or the behaviour of the ``bot'' participants. The results of this research has important implications for the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Human-Robot Interaction. Understanding humans' attitude towards interacting with autonomous agents at a fundamental level would shape how such agents are designed and implemented in the future.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

The data-set is engineered, selected, and encoded producing optimized data-sets for each model. The key metrics: r-squared, RMSE, MAE, and mean error are then estimated for both time-series and cross-sectional data using 5-fold cross-validation. The metrics indicate that random forests outperform linear regression for both data approaches and that cross-sectional outperforms time-series data partitioning approaches. The learning curves, feature importance, and normalized regression coefficients from both models prove that random forest models better estimate complexities in the housing sales function and identify important features. The paper aims to convince the reader that random forest models are more flexible, can capture more complex relationships between variables, and thus perform better in predicting future sale prices and cross-sectional home values.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Moreover, we supported the building of a third necessary component: a readability-labeled lexicon for the dictionary entries. Finally, we designed and implemented a public online interface to navigate our database. A user can also choose to search our database by Arabic words, Arabic lemmas in our standard representation, Arabic roots or English glosses. The interface provides information on part of speech, root, English gloss, a readability rating on a five-level readability scale and a list of synonyms. This database and interface are made as part of the NYUAD funded project SAMER (Simplification of Arabic Masterpieces for Extensive Reading) where it is intended to aid scholars who are tasked with simplifying Arabic literature to reach a wider audience with varying Arabic abilities.

Under current Synner's capacity, sophisticated datasets can be produced realistically in a simple manner. However, Synner stores data by row, which may bring question in its scalability performances, especially when users want to produce big data. Big data is particularly scarce making it difficult for students to test the machine learning techniques they learned outside of a classroom, let alone initiate their own projects. Additionally, startups can also face difficulty to test their products due to the lack of large datasets that are specific to their business. While Synner's current engine allows these two groups to produce realistic data that meet their circumstances, due to Synner's row-oriented storage, producing terabytes of data can raise data generation speed issues. In this paper, we further improve Synner's function by adding more tools and specifications for users to generate sophisticated dataset, and also improve Synner's scalability by integrating a column-oriented DBMS, MonetDB.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are usually used to protect from classical MITM and other attacks. However, for weak and low resource IoTs like a smart thermometer connected to the Internet, using a VPN is often rendered impractical by the overhead it adds. In this project, we consider different ideas put forward to solve this problem, discuss their drawbacks, and show that a new VPN called Wireguard drastically reduces the attack surface for hackers in comparison to other popular solutions, and also provides a compelling reason to be used as the solution. It will provide them with reliable security that usually only more powerful machines benefit from.

These bad practices negatively impact the page load times (PLTs) of the web pages. Thus, an in- tuitive way of reducing page load times is removing these duplicate scripts. There are four main categories of duplicate detection techniques: metric-based techniques, token sequence-based techniques, tree-based techniques and PDG-based techniques. However, PDG-based and metric-based techniques have al- ready been proven to be costly and not very accurate, respectively. Thus, suitable candidate algorithms must be found within the realm of tree-based and token-sequence based techniques.

This existing research largely focuses on evaluating police behavior towards minority groups while controlling for socioeconomic factors such as neighborhood characteristics, vehicle type, poverty rate, and income level. Our research takes a less traditional approach in evaluating human behavior and racial bias by evaluating how police performance is affected by environmental factors such as air pollution and temperature. We show that higher temperatures and lower air quality are associated with higher efficiency rates among police officers. Our findings further suggest that these environmental conditions may also be associated with increased bias rates towards Blacks. We then explore the link between the proportion of votes for a Republican president against police performance and bias. We find that increased proportions of voters in support of a Republican candidate are associated with superior police performance. Nevertheless, we find no evidence suggesting that increased vote share in favor of a Republican president is associated with discriminatory behavior by the police.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

A lot of the work involves a person or group of people, called metadata taggers, going through each individual piece of media and marking it up with the relevant tags, such as the scene number, transcripts, and the type of shot for video footage. Such a task is particularly time-consuming for films with high shooting ratios (i.e., footage shot/footage shown). The average high production movie has a shooting ratio between 100:1 and 1000:1. A metadata tagger's task is to watch all of these media and tag it. Assuming the most popular runtime of a movie, 101 minutes, and a conservative shooting ratio of 100, the time it would take for a single person to achieve this task is 168 hours, without even taking into account the audio recording associated with each piece of video. This is at least 21 days of a person working full-time, both delaying the post-production process significantly and placing a significant burden on independent filmmakers who often have a small budget. AutoTag automates much of the tagging process, saving both time and money. We describe the algorithms and implementation of AutoTag and report on some case studies.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Although this representation captures the phonology of the language, it is not a 1-to-1 mapping with the Arabic script version. Due to the different sound-to-letter rules of English and Arabic, there are complex mappings be-tween the two writing systems. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that Arabizi on social media is Dialectal Arabic which does not have a standard orthography. Moreover, many people writing Arabizi are bilinguals, so they code switch between Arabic and a foreign language such as English in the same sentence. To map Arabizi text to Arabic script in the context of complete sentences or utterances, previous published works have utilized finite state machines, n-gram language models and morphological analyzers. In this project, we present a sequence-to-sequence deep learn-ing model for the task. We employ a large dataset of Egyptian Arabizi words that have been transliterated to the Arabic script. Our best model beats the best previously reported results in this task.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

A Timbre forum is indexed by a blockchain while the content itself is stored separately by distributed data stores. Moderation is implemented as published streams that users can selectively apply as filters onto raw forum content. Timbre prevents blockchain re-centralization and 'buy-outs' through the use of a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm in conjunction with periodic epochs that essentially enable us to reset any form of power centralization that may occur over the course of the epoch.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

However, since we live in a 3D world, it is natural to ask if we can classify 3D shapes and extract their shape descriptors. This turns out to be rather difficult given the exponential increase in complexity with the added third dimension. To perform this classification efficiently, we propose an ensembled encoderless-decoder and classifier neural network to learn the latent encoding vectors for 3D point-cloud pair transformations. This ensemble extracts the feature descriptors of the transformations without a parametric encoder or a lossy 2D projection. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our ensemble model through a benchmark comparison on a 3D point cloud classification task for the PointNet and ModelNet dataset. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our 3D shape descriptor learners and classifiers as preprocessing techniques for eventual 3D object classification, segmentation, and database retrieval tasks.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

We show that, despite that the problem is ill-defined for deterministic transformations, the straightforward change of introducing additive noise not only fixes said issue, but also enables both neural and parameter-free MI estimates that sandwich MI by bounding it above and below. We propose novel neural MI upper bounds that this change enables, and to use them in conjunction with existing neural MI lower bounds in order to strengthen evaluations of MI estimates across the literature. Studying these different neural MI estimators and their accuracy under fixed neural architectures and datasets, we highlight their necessity as parameter-free methods struggle to scale to high dimensions and high MI settings. We also showcase a simple study of MI maximization and how our methodology can be used to measure the mutual information achieved by different unsupervised learning methods.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

To tackle this challenge, we propose EPDNet (Encoder-less Point Drift Net), a novel formulation based on auto-decoder networks that allows us to extract joint shape descriptors of 3D point cloud shape pairs without needing an encoder network, by directly optimizing latent shape descriptors for the self-supervised coherent point drift task. We show that by using this formulation, we can bypass the difficulty of designing encoders for 3D data and directly obtain informative shape descriptor vectors that capture the relationship between a pair of 3D shapes. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying the extracted shape descriptors in other computer vision tasks such as classification.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

However, because of climate change and a rise in sea temperatures, the number of coral bleaching events has drastically increased. Corals in the Arabian Gulf are most susceptible to bleaching because of the shallow conditions of the Gulf - rendering it difficult for corals to mix with deeper, cooler waters. While climate change is the main culprit of coral bleaching, other reasons include dredging and land reclamation, practices that are common in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) due to the rapid development. As such, corals, especially those that are close to the coast, are at high risk of bleaching and possibly, mortality. To decrease stress on corals, we propose a web platform, Murjan, that will use seasonal weather forecasts and a water-column model, the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM), to assess and predict the likelihood of coral bleaching in advance by producing forecasts of sea-bottom temperatures and other relevant variables. Murjan would enable its audience, one of which is government agencies, to suspend construction work when the likelihood of coral bleaching is shown to be high.</p><p>Author provided keywords: web, platform, coral, bleaching, oceanography, Arabian Gulf, Persian Gulf</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3ef47173956d87c63e462a6b302e0fdd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alkhaja, Maria. <emph render="italic">Improving Traffic by Exploiting Autonomous Vehicles</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0102</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_974f00ad083d6b49f836b1ae2308c050" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_974f00ad083d6b49f836b1ae2308c050" type="Folder">2021-0102</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_71293c04b5c389c75f3eb27f23e03397"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Congestion can easily be induced by any bottlenecks on road, including lane closures and on-ramp merging sections.

Since then, the United States of America alone has spent 2.8 trillion dollars on counter-terrorism efforts. Although these efforts have curbed several uprisings of major terrorist organizations, preemptively predicting acts of terrorism with much detail has continued to prove exceedingly difficult over the years. The reasons behind the struggles of law enforcement and counter-terrorism agencies across the globe is the lack of clarity behind deep terrorist motivations and the lack of access to historical and real time data on terrorism. We used meticulously analyzed, clustered, and classified historical global governance and terrorism data to formulate models that highlight key indicators that had significant corre- lations to past spikes in terrorist activity. Once we identified such indicators and established a pattern, we displayed the results on an interactive web application. As such, this project has three main deliverables: a synthesized dataset tracking thousands of different global indicators arranged in an intuitive 2-axes format, a terrorism activity prediction model generated using a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator on the dataset, and a web platform that enables users to visualize and extract data. </p><p>Author provided keywords: Global Terrorism Database (GTD), GIS, Interactive web application.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_223dbbb12f8e30070a8e83284afbab8c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ansari, Aizaz. <emph render="italic">Developing a Post Processing System to ImproveArabic OCR</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0086</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_5bb1c2f72a7bb1ab99dede7487d8d0d4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_5bb1c2f72a7bb1ab99dede7487d8d0d4" type="Folder">2021-0086</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_27bc5d551196e724e38592d30cd4a2b2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Arabic Optical Character Recognition (OCR) remains a challenging problem due to the cursive nature of the language, and contemporary Arabic OCR systems struggle to achieve high word accuracy rates.

An uncertainty-based inverted encoding model (TAFKAP) was trained on the brain's processed BOLD response to different stimuli, measured through MRI. The project relied on a dataset where subjects observed dot clouds moving in different directions in the horizontal (xz) plane while their brain activity was measured. Using a new algorithm TAFKAP, the brain was modeled through uncertainty-based methods that could capture these correlations. While uncertainty-based decoding techniques have been used before, they have predominantly been applied to 2D orientation (rather than 3D motion). Neurons responsive to retinal orientation exist at an early stage of the visual hierarchy and as such are thought to be easier to decode, whereas 3D motion sensitive neurons are thought to exist later in the visual hierarchy and are therefore more difficult to decode. This project found that 3D motion could be successfully decoded from several ROIs (regions of interest like V1, V2, hMT, IPS) at an accuracy of greater than 50% (baseline chance at 12.5%). </p><p>Author provided keywords: Inverted encoding, Visual Hierarchy, Motion-Based Stimuli</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4af676ad2fbc3f07e38319d3ebe51c5d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Fernando, Dunumalage Romeno Wenogk. <emph render="italic">Hide and seek!

This method works by obtaining a combination of browser attributes (or features) from the browsing environment of the user and producing a fingerprint ID. The fingerprint ID is subject to change as attribute(s) in the system are updated. Pugliese et al. [7] conducted a three-year long study that resulted in the collection and analysis of fingerprints. This paper proposes the first entropy analysis done on the data set consisting of 37,762 fingerprints and 854 users (a subset of the entire data set from Pugliese) which helped identify key attributes and combinations of attributes that help with user deanonymization. Among the deanonymization attack methods we propose, we present the results of one such attack. Our dynamic deanonymization attack algorithm produced 86.2% accuracy in matching anonymized fingerprints with just 25 of the total available 216 attributes that were selected based on the entropy analysis. Identifying the specific attributes that require more protection [3] would aid in the mission of ensuring web privacy and serves as a starting point for privacy policy development that is integrated into the browser environment.</p><p>Author provided keywords: deanonymization attacks, web user identification, privacy, browser fingerprinting</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6a778891536e23ea43b89458f7ff0ddd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gan, Berwin. <emph render="italic">Approximations for Covering in a Streaming Setting, Covering with Orthants</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0087</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_8a6029f26f6b15f4aaabd33645b70c66" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_8a6029f26f6b15f4aaabd33645b70c66" type="Folder">2021-0087</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fe9ea704b1bed58b3ccf330417f779ef"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We present approximations schemes for local variations on the unit disc covering problem in a streaming setting.

To solve the lack of primary data, two databases are used in this project: 1) Terrorists Survey Database (TSD): A database made by surveying more than 12,000 terrorists in Sri Lanka gathered by Professor Jocelyn Belanger 2) Global Terrorism Database (GTD): a database that contains information about terrorist activities from 1970 until 2019, prepared by The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). To solve the limitation of the quantitative techniques, a powerful deep learning technique called Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) is used to analyze both databases. SOM is a type of Artificial Neural Network that uses competitive learning to create low-dimensional views of high-dimensional datasets. The current results show interesting correlations that lead to potential hypotheses about terrorism. Furthermore, the clusters created by SOMs contain characteristic features that are potential candidates for the terrorist profile. The implication and meaning of the current results will be studied during the psychological evaluation of the results.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Terrorism, Deep Learning, Artificial Neural Networks, Self-Organizing Maps</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_302a9e5f15711c72972de09f0ed3b4fd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gunkova, Magda. <emph render="italic">Imagined Communities in Multilingual Wikipedia: Evaluating Theories of Ethnic Nationalism with Geographic and National Data</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0101</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_2e789ba1cf3892ca32bba0ba5e343695" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_2e789ba1cf3892ca32bba0ba5e343695" type="Folder">2021-0101</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1c4b1f557d47aa0dcfa37f400983f008"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We argue that in addition to the traditional definitions of bias, there are other, more subtle forms of bias that exist within articles about the same people written in different languages and we use the terms "crowd" or "community" bias to label this phenomenon.

Additionally, due to the lack of a unified qualitative metric, it is nearly impossible to fairly compare results obtained from different user studies campaigns. This capstone demonstrates the lack of qualitative evaluation metrics, and propose QLUE (QuaLitative Uniform Evaluation), a tool that automates the qualitative evaluation of web pages using computer vision. Our results show that QLUE computes comparable content and functional similarity scores to those provided by human evaluators.

The advantage of using SafePredict has been demonstrated using this scikit-learn implementation for different online learning scenarios. A brief example using the MNIST digit recognition dataset is shown to provide an intuitive understanding of the refusal mechanism of SafePredict. This example also shows how the scikit-learn implementation can be used out-of-the-box for a simple application. A similar example with a changing data distribution using the cod-rna dataset demonstrates SafePredict limiting the error rate of accepted predictions despite the base estimator having an unbounded error rate due to a change in the data distribution. An example forecasting the returns of publicly traded companies from the OEX-100 is used to shown how the package can be extended for more advanced applications and the advantages of using SafePredict through an intuitive measure of an average profit gain of 37 percent for a trading strategy across 97 companies.</p><p>Author provided keywords: machine learning refusal accuracy prediction safepredict python scikit-learn</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d71ff53f28945238660ac832af115df0" level="file"><did><unittitle> Jawed, Muhammad Anas. <emph render="italic">Developing a Post Processing System to Improve Arabic OCR</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0103</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_c5c83e7e2f1634955bb5863a5ea948e5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c5c83e7e2f1634955bb5863a5ea948e5" type="Folder">2021-0103</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c29fa72a6fffcac1aeabbb1c7e9588ec"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Arabic Optical Character Recognition (OCR) remains a challenging problem due to the cursive nature of the language, and contemporary Arabic OCR systems struggle to achieve high word accuracy rates.

To support the plethora of functionalities, web developers rely heavily on JavaScript, specifically large general-purpose third-party libraries. Although this tends to accelerate the development cycle, it increases the overall page complexity by bringing additional functions that might not be utilized by the page but are unnecessarily processed by the browser. In this paper, we propose Muzeel; a solution for eliminating JavaScript functions that are not used in a given web page–this is commonly referred to as dead code. Despite the fact that dead code is never executed, it impacts the overall performance of the web page since it is downloaded and processed by the browser. Muzeel extracts all of the page event listeners (upon page load), emulates user interactions using a bot that triggers each of these events, and then generates a comprehensive function call graph in order to eliminate the dead code of functions that are not called by any of these events.</p><p>Author provided keywords: web simplification, superfluous javascript, javascript optimization</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f40d0d208716fb7dd1734919bb458640" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lim, Chaerin. <emph render="italic">Breast Cancer Screening via Microbiome Classification</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0090</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_7400475746017860aac0e1dca79bba34" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_7400475746017860aac0e1dca79bba34" type="Folder">2021-0090</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_85b431d91e01af5c2b94a63120568f7a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Recent findings have proven that the abundances of specific microbiota found in the human tissue can be associated with the growth of cancer.

Random Forest performed best in all our datasets when used with a feature set with HFE applied. From our extracted feature sets, certain OTUs matched the microbiomes found to be more abundant in breast cancer cases, supporting some of the findings in previous breast cancer metagenomics research. We found that g_Bacteroides had higher abundances in the gut microbiota of breast cancer samples than in controls. This result overlapped with the finding of Byrd et al., suggesting that the bacteria may be an informative biomarker in screening breast cancer. This research assessed the potential of microbiomes in breast cancer prediction, to produce a practical, cheap, and non- invasive screening tool that can ultimately be used for efficient cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Author provided keywords: breast cancer, machine learning, feature selection, microbiome classification</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9dd215dee9315a6da8d4aee7e860de5a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Liu, Xixuan. <emph render="italic">Public Cooperation in a Human-Bot Society</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0111</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_e15552abfea5bf0cbb705f6babd4ee9c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e15552abfea5bf0cbb705f6babd4ee9c" type="Folder">2021-0111</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8c01516d6512a4764cbd11395c427fdb"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study employs the Iterated Public Goods Game (IPGG) in which the best strategies for maximum individual gain and maximum group gain are contradictory.

This study would also expand our understand- ing on human-bot interaction in group settings as current studies have focused on two player scenarios in dilemmas exclusively.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Public Goods Game, human-computer interaction, punish- ment, AI, cooperation</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4d50e1aced252cd33687b89ef26a54b4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Majgaonkar, Oorja. <emph render="italic">Assessing training data quantity for optimum performance of LiDAR object classification models</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0105</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_89bf9bc95e0bf9d97abd2154ea47f7c9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_89bf9bc95e0bf9d97abd2154ea47f7c9" type="Folder">2021-0105</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b745f1b15aea2737c7c4ebb3c9d5e0ab"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Classifying objects within aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is an essential but time-consuming task to which machine learning is being increasingly applied, especially neural networks specifically for 3D data. However, there has not been an examination into the quantity of data required to train a reliable, high performing model. It is found that the underlying assumptions about training data for such networks remain largely uncovered and unaddressed. Generating training data from LiDAR point clouds necessitates significant manual labour, so there is an incentive in establishing the minimal model requires to achieve acceptable performance levels. This project assessed the impact of quantity of training data on classification accuracy of PointNet, a deep learning framework tailored for 3D point clouds. A PointNet implementation was trained on subsets of a large data set called ModelNet that spanned from 40 to 2000 objects which included 40 different types of objects. Accuracy improved logarithmically, with convergence typically beginning at approximately 600,000 training points. This work provides a framemark for subsequent development by establishing a learning curve for 3D-focused classification models and suggests how much data should be manually labelled and used for training when the model is used on new data.</p><p>Author provided keywords: aerial LiDAR, object classification, learning curve, point cloud, training</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_123a710b828a78eb57d6b872d1d8a724" level="file"><did><unittitle>Makuba, Patrick Inshuti. <emph render="italic">Iruka: Accelerated Mobile Pages Through Classifying and Blocking Non-critical JavaScript</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0106</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_3a69a33b2e8ee340694b1acdcbec52fa" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3a69a33b2e8ee340694b1acdcbec52fa" type="Folder">2021-0106</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_146b750880ce12d3943be4fe51846c79"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The average page size has been increased from 1720 Kilo- bytes In 2016 to 3077 Kilobytes in 2021, where Javascript is increasingly contributing to the total page size (from 24% in 2016 to 27% in 2021). In comparison to equivalent-sized web resources, JavaScript is more expensive to process due to the requirement of parsing, interpretation and execution. This cost significantly contributes to the increasing complexity of modern mobile pages, which becomes a critical performance bottleneck for low-end smartphone devices and ultimately leads to lesser user engagement. Hence, in this paper I propose a tool which uses a machine learning algorithm to classify JavaScripts into different categories from which are used as a basis point to block non-critical Javascript, with the aim of reducing the amount of JavaScripts in a fully loaded web-page. The tool is a form of browser plugin that is privacy-preserving, since it offers an independent client-end solution that does not require any external interaction with any third-party service. The proposed plugin is empowered by a neural network model which detects categories of JavaScript elements used in web pages with an accuracy of 89.33%. </p><p>Author provided keywords: Machine Learning, Neural Network, Document Object Model, Page Load Time</p></scopecontent></c><c audience="internal" id="aspace_50b108b159e86ee1360d92710fb4462a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Matera, Sebastiano Pio. <emph render="italic">TREEsearch: The Utilization of Decision Trees in Order to Decrease the Amount of Global Research Debt</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0108</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_9733aa89afa31148dd55500249ca5454" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9733aa89afa31148dd55500249ca5454" type="Folder">2021-0108</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1da733c6cfa60eba157a171ea194cc79"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Researchers of today's world are cursed with a vast amount of complex and valuable scholarly data.

The existence of such knowledge graphs and bases means there is a lot of data to our disposal to be used for several purposes. However, without proper embeddings of the entities in these knowledge graphs and bases, it is difficult to take full advantage of the rich and vast amount of data available to us. Learning useful representations or embeddings from such graph entities is useful for a variety of machine learning applications, including but not limited to, natural language processing, entity prediction and relation prediction. Besides reducing the engineering effort, these representations can lead to greater predictive power. Although there have been recent works in embeddings of knowledge graphs and bases there haven't been any yet that take advantage of the cross-lingual nature of Wikipedia and Wikidata. To this effect, our Capstone project focuses on learning embeddings of entities and articles Wikipedia across multiple languages. These embeddings will then be used to create a tool for article or entity prediction across multiple languages. </p><p>Author provided keywords: Wikidata, Wikipedia, articles, hyperlink, knowledge, base, graph, entity prediction, embeddings</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8655aec49bbf1740c1642df748abb95a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Plachouras, Christos. <emph render="italic">Audio-Based Hierarchical Structure Analysis for Evaluating Music Similarity</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0113</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_ff83d46e24f730d5057d24f464ae4fa7" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_ff83d46e24f730d5057d24f464ae4fa7" type="Folder">2021-0113</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_63bb83f46f4d9bba64ce7ad12c8a1e62"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Structure is an important compositional element in music. Analyzing the structure of musical pieces is a common practice among musicians and musicologists, but even among them here isn't always agreement on the exact segmentation and granularity of it. It is, therefore, challenging to automatize the task of constructing a representation of structure from the audio of a piece and to measure the structural similarity between pieces while accounting for repetition patterns at different levels of granularity. This problem exists at the core of the more general question of how to define the similarity between musical pieces. In this work, I propose methods for measuring the structural similarity between musical pieces by decomposing them hierarchically and comparing their structure at different levels of granularity. The proposed decomposition relies on encoding global and local repetition patterns within a piece and constructing low-rank approximations of them using techniques from spectral graph theory. The behavior of different decomposition configurations and structural similarity metrics is investigated under several audio perturbations and for the task of cover song identification. Subsequently, methods are suggested for using this structure representation to define more meaningful music similarity metrics. </p><p>Author provided keywords: music similarity, audio segmentation, music information retrieval, digital signal processing</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ee6910e943b5199a4a08b46f961769b9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Suri, Navya. <emph render="italic">Revisiting the Uncanny Valley using Generative Adversarial Networks</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0104</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_654cbaa88e67cd10e8370a4c63b5f69d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_654cbaa88e67cd10e8370a4c63b5f69d" type="Folder">2021-0104</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_805ab8c812286ddc4902a29178e4a75a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The "uncanny valley" is a phenomenon first described by Masahiro Mori as the observation that when non-human beings appear more human-like, they become more appealing to humans, but only up-to a certain point.

Through the 5G standard, the 3GPP alliance attempted to create new defense mechanisms that can detect abuse of these protocols. However, we argue that not all messages exchanged within these two protocols are efficiently protected by these novel countermeasures. We highlight cases where protocol messages could be attacked indirectly, despite being encrypted and integrity-protected. These attacks results in unexpected network disruptions affecting the security of the system and privacy of the users. Thus, adding an extra layer of prevention and detection in this security network can make the network more resilient to attacks. We introduce a Machine Learning model that can detect active cellular attacks based on the disruption of the network. By using tractable data points from benign and attacked traffic, the model will learn the inconsistencies of an attacked network, ultimately detecting the attack. We investigate 8 attack scenarios proven possible by past research reports, which are analyzed in order to derive the appropriate training features and traceable parameters that can be used as input to the ML technique.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Security, LTE, 5G, Machine Learning, Network Security</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5b3b7175e55455f48347b37ac8cc9251" level="file"><did><unittitle>Warmuz, Krzysztof. <emph render="italic">In Search for Optimized Collective Variables for Molecular Dynamics Simulations</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0116</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_9a251e3d43acbe3eee1a2be1c4e8ff72" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9a251e3d43acbe3eee1a2be1c4e8ff72" type="Folder">2021-0116</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fbdd23a609cba510f195d91465c2dea8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This report summarizes the progress and achievements of the capstone project in analyzing and improving the effective ness of artificial intelligence algorithm applied for dynamic Collective Variable (CV) sampling in Molecular Dynamics (MD). The computational chemistry is being strongly limited by the time scale factor of the MD simulations due multitude of their degrees of freedom. Currently applied way of improving the efficiency is by introducing a set of CVs, from which the most significant ones can be indicated as the reaction coordinates, greatly reducing the complexity of the simulations. Since the knowledge of CVs a priori is a daunting task, most of the contemporary approaches remain subjected to the trial-and-error methods. In this project several alternatives were analyzed, heavily embracing ma chine learning and automatizing the process of CV sampling as the simulation is running, that is 'on the fly'. The significance of CVs in characterizing the conformational transitions and enhancing the conformational sampling of biomolecules was thoroughly investigated and used to develop a state-of art linear regression algorithm based on the cross-entropy minimization.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Molecular Dynamics, Collective Variables, Enhanced Sampling, Machine Learning, Cross Entropy</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2215212e7ffe179a8ebd5254f169b041" level="file"><did><unittitle>Zameek, Abdullah Ruzni. <emph render="italic">Revisiting the Uncanny Valley using Generative Adversarial Networks</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0084</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_cd3cf0c034d23b2ca49ded41186c5173" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_cd3cf0c034d23b2ca49ded41186c5173" type="Folder">2021-0084</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_774af4f53aa8cea39875ecb119fb1b1d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The "uncanny valley" is a phenomenon first described by Masahiro Mori as the observation that when non-human beings appear more human-like, they become more appealing to humans, but only up-to a certain point.

The report also describes the shortfalls of spectral clustering, current efforts to improve these shortfalls and my own contributions to the area.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7c32557a2fae921199409e90e1f090fc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Zhong, Shelley. <emph render="italic">On the Normalized Numerical Range of Normal Matrices</emph></unittitle><unitid>2017-0036</unitid><abstract id="aspace_15254ef2dc11b73a16c845fc5460451e">My capstone explores the normalized numerical range of normal matrices.

Exploiting certain formal similarities between these two models, we extrapolate the random current representation, a geometric representation of the ferromagnetic Ising Model, to the DGFF in an effort to provide a different perspective on the latter model, one that can potentially be useful to compute quantities of interest.

This project aims to address this gap in scientific knowledge and provide insight about the ability of a forest to recover after a selective cut by modeling the dynamical system of the coexistence between trees and vines subject to disturbances. We suggest that depending on the shape of the basin boundary, a selective cut can shift the system from the healthy to the unhealthy basin of attraction. This would mean that with time, the forest does not recover to its initial healthy state but falls into a long-lasting degraded state implying that selective cutting can have a long-term negative impact on the forest ecosystem.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6358b207e3e5808b8f51ecf046498173" level="file"><did><unittitle>Zhu, Lin. <emph render="italic">Simulation of sinking spheroidal phytoplanktons</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0111</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_3b62337428d1de33dbca35a06e219ef4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3b62337428d1de33dbca35a06e219ef4" type="Folder">2019-0111</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f15a660060c6a04c89304eb2e128e41a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We speculate that the sinking fraction of plankton cells can vary with respect to their shapes.

On the other hand, models based on ferromagnetic models (Ising and Potts) do not have real cluster formation but they exhibit social imitation only. However, clustering and spatial Markovianity, both are highly desired properties of a model depicting real life market scenarios. We verify that if clustering is done by the less intuitive Random Cluster Model, an intermediate model can be formed that incorporates real cluster formation as well as social imitation.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

One of the rising challenges in finance is that the complexity of financial instruments and markets has led financial engineers to seek and employ increasingly sophisticated mathematical tools to address financial issues, such as the pricing of financial derivatives. The Black-Scholes option pricing model has become the firm basis for financial mathematics which finds adequate solutions to the pricing of a world-wide rapidly increasing number of derivatives. Many option pricing models have been developed since Black and Scholes pub- lished their work in 1973. In this paper, we study the original Black-Scholes option pricing model for European call options in terms of its derivation and applicability. By constructing a riskless portfolio taking positions in bonds (cash), option, and the under- lying stock, we derive the Black-Scholes partial differential equations without and with dividends for European calls. With a series of changes of variables, we transform the Black-Scholes equation to the heat equation and obtain a closed-form solution to the original equation, known as the Black-Scholes formula. The applicability is evaluated through a comparison of the Black-Scholes model and the real market data.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

The shape of the numerical range can be determined through the associated ternary polynomial $F(t, x, y) = \det(tI_n + x(A + A^*)/2 + y(A - A*)/2i))$. In this research, a series of necessary and sufficient conditions will be given to determine when a tridiagonal matrix where $a_{ij}=a_{ji}^{-1}$ for |i-j|=1 and zero otherwise will have an elliptical numerical range. Moreover, this project provides a condition on the entries of matrices H and Z so that they can be factored into matrices C and D where $H = C^*C + DD^*$ and $Z =DC$.	</p><p>Author contributed to keywords:

In this paper, the limit of the maximal numerical range under the Aluthge transform for 2 × 2 matrices and matrices with a distinct largest eigenvalue by magnitude is established and the limit for 3×3 matrices is conjectured. Some results for the unitary reducibility of the Aluthge transform and the geometric shape of the numerical range under an iteration of the Aluthge transform are also obtained. The center of mass of a matrix is introduced and renamed as the Stampfli point. The Stampfli point is described completely for 2 × 2 matrices and results regarding the inclusion of Stampfli Point in the numerical range and the convex hull of spectrum are obtained. Finally, a condition for the Stampfli being equal to zero for a triple eigenvalue matrix in terms of the off-diagonal entries are established.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Computations of the Chern-Simons invariant of the Thurston geometries were performed, leading to results on the conformal embedding of these in Euclidean space. Then, the Physical Chern-Simons theory was studied from the traditional QFT picture, and in specific its geometric, and path integral quantizations. It was subsequently studied from the point of view of Category Theory via axiomatic TQFT and its generalization, extended TQFT. This led to an extensive exploration on the relevant categorical objects and results, especially those concerning monoidal categories in a broad sense. The argument for the partial extension of Chern-Simons as an extended TQFT was studied closely, specifically in relation to geometric quantization, and the Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFT's.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Chern-Simons; characteristic classes; extended TQFT.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bb6cd52c9262bf03534b6a0afaee7fe9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Raees, Faiq. <emph render="italic">Stability of Self-similar Solutions of Inviscid Burgers Equation</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0117</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_2ef2bdee244f5750547a8be5caa30c5c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_2ef2bdee244f5750547a8be5caa30c5c" type="Folder">2021-0117</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f87baa0761ff7e1a1c1ebb6fe51f541c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper is based on the stability of self similar solutions, that describe the formation of shocks for Burgers equation, using energy methods in Eulerian coordinates. The Burger's equation is a classical example of a nonlinear hy- perbolic equation for which smooth solutions can become singular in finite time. My capstone then is based upon the analysis of these smooth solutions and their behaviour near the shock formation time. We establish some results regarding the analytic profiles of the self-similar solutions particularly that they are a diffeomorphism onto their image and they are of order similar to their implicit equation near origin. We also study the spectrum of the linearised operator that is suitable to the self-similar variables and then use these results to estab- lish that a perturbed self similar solution will converge to the self similar profile provided that the perturbation is small enough initially. The result is shown using a method of characteristics and bootstrapping argument and thereby the stability of the solution is proved.</p><p>Author provided keywords: PDEs Burger-Equation Stability Bootstrapping-Principle</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_4758853148d5e00b83250f0e39eb1775" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Physics</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref77_y9u" level="file"><did><unittitle>Blumer, Katharine Eileen. <emph render="italic">Precise Determination of Cellular Uptake of Cell-Penetrating Pepties Using FACS-FCS</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0050</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="133" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">133</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_d5f81e517edd7feaa6d9a039d34449c9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d5f81e517edd7feaa6d9a039d34449c9" type="Folder">2014-0050</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8a68c093c1c8c1d63886cce0acccb561"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Physics<lb/>Abstract: We combine fluorescence activated cell sorting with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to measure cellular uptake of small molecules in moles per cell both quickly and accurately, while taking into account confounding factors such as cell death.

Abstract: HD189733b is one of the most extensively studied exoplanets to date. The Jupiter sized gas giant orbits close to its host star with a two day period, and due to tidal locking, one side is constantly and heavily irradiated. Transmission spectra and secondary eclipse observations of HD189733b suggest that mineral dust clouds are prominent in the upper atmosphere. Cloud formation and dust opacities, however, are generally omitted from global circulation models. We present radial dust opacity profiles of HD189733b based on a 3D radiative-hydrodynamical simulation and a kinetic cloud formation model specifically tuned for the planet. We find that (1) optical properties of clouds are dominated by iron condensates on the dayside and by silicates on the nightside; (2) cloud formation is restricted to low pressures in the atmosphere; and (3) cloud structure varies significantly with longitude and wavelength. The observed trends might be valid for other hot Jupiters as well, and, if incorporated into general circulation models, could lead to improved understanding of the atmospheric circulation of extrasolar planets.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Opacity (Optics)</subject><subject source="local">HD189733b</subject><subject source="local">Hot Jupiters</subject><subject source="lcsh">Jupiter (Planet)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref375_k9b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dahal, Sumit. <emph render="italic">Characterization of Muon Events in XENON100 Dark Matter Detector</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0042</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3410" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3410</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_30449a17dc017874960543d33aa66e24" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_30449a17dc017874960543d33aa66e24" type="Folder">2015-0042</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5e73e7f6b69c67d284cf311b604d9205"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Physics, Mathematics<lb/>Abstract: The XENON100 dark matter experiment is designed to detect xenon nuclear recoils resulting from the scattering of dark matter Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).

The wave arrival time difference is used to define a locus of possible origins, which intersects uniquely with the calving front. This method is motivated by difficulties with traditional seismic location methods that fail due to the emergent nature of calving, which obscures the P and S-wave onsets, and the proximity of the seismometers, which combines body and surface waves into one arrival. A mix of tidal and seismic data and satellite imagery are used to confirm a list of calving events at Helheim Glacier from August 2013 to August 2014. In particular, two events in the week beginning August 11 2014 that were seen in person are used to calibrate the method, which is then applied to other calving events. An extension of this method with one more station would allow for triangulation location that would not depend on satellite or camera imagery.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Back azimuth method</subject><subject source="lcsh">Azimuthal projection (Cartography)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Glaciers</subject><subject source="lcsh">Triangulation</subject><subject source="lcsh">Seismic event location</subject><subject source="lcsh">Seismological stations</subject><subject source="lcsh">Glaciers |x Calving</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref477_tcu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chamba, Roshan Nushkia. <emph render="italic">A Background Analysis of XENON100 Calibration Data using Compton Scattering.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0043</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="8113" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">8113</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_9b94df2e145583f1e11ef1fbd09612e7">The aim of the XENON experiment is to directly detect cold, non-baryonic Dark Matter (DM) in the form ofWeakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) that recoil from Xenon (Xe) nuclei.

The goal is to explicitly target events connected to low energy gamma rays emitted from the earth's atmosphere and in turn collect and analyze data focused and specific on this phenomenon to improve correlation studies with lightning and other atmospheric parameters.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d979ad93b1bda4db8896162e4d6d641a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Isakovic, Jasmina. <emph render="italic">Electromagnetic fields around neurons interact with T-cells in the CNS and initiate autoimmune response: a parallel between multiple sclerosis and ischemic stroke.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2017-0029</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2017/2017">2017</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_7f8a94967dd2a7c4aec93e9c253a9c72">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease where a mutation in the gene encoding for a protein belonging to the NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 12 (NLRP12) enables the T-cells to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and damage the myelin sheath.

Previous detectors used to study TGFs were limited by their slow response times and therefore more observations are needed to construct a model to describe this phenomena. The proposed detector is based on Cerium(III) Bromide crystals coupled to a compact (Hamamatsu R11265U-100) photomultiplier tube. This instrument will have a faster time response, high resolution (3.5% at 661 keV) and a high density. Given the limited power consumption on a Cubesat (2-6W), the aim is to develop a low cost detector with extremely low power requirements and a response time of less than 100 ns that can be standardized to fit within 1U of a CubeSat. This describes the characteristics of the prototype unit detector such as linearity, voltage gain, and the gain as a function of temperature for the crystal and PMT.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_50b40dd179f5db30e619bb447afec797" level="file"><did><unittitle>D'Alterio, Kristopher. <emph render="italic">Automatization of Faint NEO Follow-Up</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0050</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_deb9426b88242b630643cc3ca84bf7cf" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_deb9426b88242b630643cc3ca84bf7cf" type="Folder">2018-0050</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e13bb7d483de882ed16f9797dab562ed"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this paper we describe a method to improve the follow up process for near earth objects (NEOs), especially for faint and fast moving NEOs. Current follow up procedures typically use imaging with telescope in sidereal rotation and as a consequence the image of the moving NEO is a linear track instead of a point source. This makes it difficult to recover faint or fast moving sources. We propose a new follow up method where the telescope tracks the NEO rather than tracking with sidereal motion, and therefore focuses the image onto a smaller number of pixels. In order to explore the effectiveness of such a method, we have created simulated images which accurately depict the images that would be found if this method were applied, and determined the recovery rate of NEOs for such simulated images under varying conditions. We have also identified future work that should be done in order to improve these recovery rates, and laid out a framework for making a complete statistical evaluation of the method, which would give a description of the recovery rate of the method as a function of the magnitude and velocity of an NEO.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_38127c8ab0fc88693add2f0a27a47544" level="file"><did><unittitle>Stoychev, Boyan. <emph render="italic">Constraining nature of dark matter with high redshift galaxies</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0056</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_b27cec4af932beea865755526fdadbd2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b27cec4af932beea865755526fdadbd2" type="Folder">2018-0056</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b4614ad1129e54515016b95b3997614f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models provide a promising alternative cosmological scenario to the standard Λ Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Numerous studies have employed cosmological numerical simulations to constrain the allowed mass of WDM particles based on low-redshift observational data. When restricted to  this range, viable WDM models produce indistinguishable predictions at low redshift that are in agreement with CDM. In this work, galaxy formation at z = 6-10 was studied in the framework of the NIHAO project, comparing 3keV WDM to CDM. Halo mass functions were calculated from dark-matter-only simulations of the  CDM and WDM scenarios, and fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Simulations of galaxy formation using hydrodynamics were used to construct stellar mass - halo mass relations, which were then fitted with power laws. Those simulations were also used to calculate the fraction of galaxies that do not form stars as a function of halo mass. Finally, the above calculations were used to construct stellar mass functions for the two models at redshift 6-10, with the hope that the James Webb Space Telescope may be able to discriminate between the two models after its launch in 2020.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d9eacd1a70843ed4659f182662a64f9f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Torres, Rodrigo. <emph render="italic">Deployment of a Multidetector X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0059</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_846412c41f51bd6e38df8f63148291d0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_846412c41f51bd6e38df8f63148291d0" type="Folder">2018-0059</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cf0f9d529eae94c2879ac933dd202bad"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We present a multidetector X-ray fluorescence spectrometer, developed in collaboration with the Laboratory for Cultural Heritage (LABEC) in Florence.

Although the explosive feedback can reproduce many of the observed properties of the galaxies, such as the stellar mass-halo mass relationship, it creates disks that are too thick. In this paper we present a study of the effects of the radiative feedback on gas cooling inside the simulations and its effects on the galaxy structure. This includes the ionizing radiation coming from young and old stars. In addition, a new model for the UV background radiation, represented by the radiation coming from other galaxies or active galactic nuclei, has been implemented, which proved to have a lower feedback effect compared to the old NIHAO implementation. The star formation rate is reduced after the introduction of the new local photoionization effect, due to an increase in the cooling time of the gas. However, due to the above-mentioned effect of the new UV background, most of the properties of the newly simulated galaxies have attained values similar to the ones in the old simulations. The thickness of the disk was not significantly affected.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e33f86a1135419445049c1f487ec5701" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sinha, Vamika. <emph render="italic">Nature versus Nurture: Star Formation Rates in NIHAO</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0103</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_01f4d1da1eec34849644c0b49ade963c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_01f4d1da1eec34849644c0b49ade963c" type="Folder">2019-0103</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_57ed62b076b2cf8219715863db8c4a91"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>I study the star formation rates of galaxies throughout their lifetimes using a large sample of hydrodynamical, cosmological simulations. I show that blackhole feedback is successful in quenching star formation in the largest galaxies. I construct a new quantity, Δ log Star Formation Rate, that relates the star formation rate of individual galaxies to galaxies similar to them in age and mass. I find an inverse correlation between halo formation time, measured through galaxy concentration, and Δ log SFR. Galaxies with halos that form earlier tend to underproduce stars throughout their lifetimes, while late bloomers tend to be chronic overproducers of stars. This is evidence that dark matter may play more of a role in driving star formation than previously realized.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2c29090b954c70f4a3c1809493189039" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rosenthal, Michael. <emph render="italic">Mapping the Warped H2O Maser Disk in the Low-Mass Galaxy IC 750</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0098</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_73a291dc9625ce9ffc55ccb8c6926830" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_73a291dc9625ce9ffc55ccb8c6926830" type="Folder">2019-0098</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_aa132450bddb5815a65d039b8aaf4bcd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We present the first map of water masers in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of the dwarf galaxy IC 750.

We studied the Bondi-Hoyle accretion model coupled with black hole feedback, the gravitational torque accretion model, and the viscous disk accretion model which both do not require black hole feedback. For each of the models, we probed the interaction between black holes and their host galaxies through in- vestigating black hole-host galaxy scaling relations and examined the observed co- evolution of galaxies and their black holes. This was accomplished through running numerical simulations of galaxy formation, post-processing analysis, and utilizing observational data sets to constraint the model's parameter space. We report that all models match observations down to redshift 1, and note that the viscous disk model shows the strongest co-evolution between the black hole mass and the stellar mass, the gravitational torque model shows co-evolution at high black hole masses, while the Bondi-Hoyle model shows no co-evolution.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f1529aa106116a37f70a859be0494ab1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chang, Chuan. <emph render="italic">A Method to Probe the Mechanical Properties of Cells and Nuclei Using Optically Trapped Microstructures</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0055</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_379a9d3feea49eac5685bd3f323d1d57" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_379a9d3feea49eac5685bd3f323d1d57" type="Folder">2020-0055</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_012e0aa6a3dd9cd7775c8af87141b3aa"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The cell and the cell nucleus are highly dynamic systems that can generate and detect forces through the cytoskeleton. By exerting piconewton forces on them and observing their deformations, one can detect changes in their organization and composition. To improve the versatility of optical tweezers often used for mechanical characterization of cells and nuclei, specifically designed and optically trapped handles with designated trapping and sample-attachment sites were fabricated and used as handles to manipulate a sample of cell or nucleus. By sandwiching the sample between two handles, the design of the handles uniquely allows for the exertion of compression, extension, shear, and twist forces while detecting the sample's response. In addition, the design prevents photodamage of the sample and allows for a variable contact area and shape. The handles are 3D-printed through two-photon laser lithography and functionalized with streptavidin to for specific attachment with biotin-functionalized samples. In this report, the method was demonstrated using beads as test samples. Towards applying this method to mechanically characterize nuclei with different lamin mutations, cell nuclei were isolated, functionalized with biotin, and their attachment with streptavidin-functionalized handles demonstrated.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Access to these parameters is essential in designing and testing novel drug delivery strategies. Obtaining these parameters deep inside tissue is still an experimental challenge. Despite the many recent advances, the optical-fiber-based FCS method is yet to be extended for deep tissue measurements. To address this issue, we have been developing an Optical Fiber FCS (OFFCS) method that will allow for deep tissue measurements. We have built and demonstrated the OFFCS method, based on a versatile and easily constructed schematic of the setup. We have demonstrated the feasibility of the setup and the performance of FCS measurements by achieving a low background compared to sample measurements. Further development of this method may unlock its use for measurements in biological settings.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Since RNA structure often consists of rigid double-stranded helices connected by flexible single-stranded junctions, the helix-junction-helix (HJH) system serves as a viable model to study RNA dynamics. Available experimental data on this model has shown that metrics such as radius of gyration and helix-to-helix distance do not follow a monotonic trend when ionic concentrations increase. For this reason, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations at various concentrations of KCl were carried out to investigate the conformations of the RNA HJH model. The conformational ensemble of the RNA was explored by molecular dynamics and well-tempered Metadynamics simulations. Results allowed computing the free energy surface and populations of stable states, providing a direct comparison between experiments. Ensemble averages computed from conformational ensembles closely match experimental results, providing a verified source of atomically detailed conformations for the HJH system. Analysis of ion distribution and base stacking was performed to understand their contributions to modulate the conformational states and the non-monotonic changes reported upon changes in ionic strength.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Moreover, supernova remnants that show direct observational evidence for proton accelerations to high energies are rare, and it is unclear under which circumstances remnants efficiently produce these particles. Kes 17 is a remnant that shows evidence of efficient particle accelerations. In this project, we analyze its γ-ray and X-ray spectra, with the goal of measuring the total energy of its cosmic ray population, spatial variations in the properties of the thermal-ray emitting plasma, and constraining any non-thermal X-ray emission. We found no evidence of non-thermal X-ray emission. The X-ray emitting plasma is out of thermal equilibrium suggesting that the remnant is young. The temperature profile shows that the mixed-morphology of Kes 17 is caused by the thermal conduction scenario. Thermal conduction requires that Kes 17 is 2700 to 5900 years old, consistent with the global X-ray spectrum. The spatial spectral variations suggest that Kes 17 is in a complex environment. In addition, we found recombination continua in the South-East, indicating that the plasma there is overionized.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

When the accretion disc of the system becomes unstable, an outburst takes place, resulting in the emission of X-rays. For the first part of the project, an alert system- using Python scripts- was created. This system detects the LMXB outbursts in real time. It also sends email alerts whenever there is interesting activity taking place in a LMXB. For the second part, a specific black hole system- SWIFT J1910.2-0546- was studied. This binary system has an unusual extreme flaring which was previously unknown. I wrote Astronomer's Telegrams to notify the community of interesting behavior in order to get multiwavelength data on the objects. Then, X-ray-optical correlations and color magnitude diagrams of SWIFT J1910.2-0546 were plotted to deduce the temperature and behavior of the object. Based on the results, the flickering behavior and temperature changes indicate waves of ionization of hydrogen. This is probably due to the star heating up and dumping more matter onto the disc, increasing the mass accretion rate temporarily.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

However, 1000s of gamma-ray sources still remain unassociated with any astrophysical object. It is believed that many of these could be millisecond pulsars (MSPs). One reason for their non-detection is that acceleration searches used to account for the orbital motion of the pulsar are only effective when the observation time is less than 1/10th of the orbital period. We have been using the novel jerk search algorithm implemented in the PRESTO software package to re-search Fermi sources that remain unidentified. Jerk search is sensitive to changes in the period of the pulsed signal up to its second derivative caused by the orbital motion, resulting in increased sensitivity to tight binary systems. Searching radio data gathered from the Green Bank Telescope at 820 MHz for unassociated Fermi sources, we have discovered 4 MSPs, one of which has been confirmed to be a tight-binary system belonging to the Black Widow class of pulsars.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

In this work, we use a simple system which consists of a crowder and a molecule of interest consisting of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to investigate how the size of the molecule changes with crowding. We find that depending on its length, ssDNA can behave in two completely opposite manners: either compressing or expanding under the influence of crowding. The later part of this work outlines an attempt to explain this behavior, considering the impact of the statistical conformation of different ssDNA lengths as the main factor that is responsible for this behaviour.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Biophysics, Macromolecular Crowding, Polymer Conformation</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b757e05e720c2522ec76eba8bf3ffaed" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mishra, Umang. <emph render="italic">Multilayer Dielectric Haloscope for Dark Photon Detections</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0124</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_fa25feac616a79a0b5e3260883ff53e6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_fa25feac616a79a0b5e3260883ff53e6" type="Folder">2021-0124</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b34575132027d1f738a2124c002d4881"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Non-thermal production mechanisms could generate light bosonic dark matter (DM) particles. Such DM candidates, the dark photons (DP), would interact with the standard model (SM) matter via the kinetic mixing parameter. Dielectric haloscopes, which consist of thin dielectric layers with alternating high and low refractive indices, can convert dark photons into SM photons when the DM Compton wavelength matches the periodicity of the target. For this capstone project, we developed an SiO2/Si3N4 dielectric haloscope coupled with a single photon detector for the detection of dark photons. We optimized the dielectric stack so that the DP-SM photon conversion would be maximum at 809 nm and explored different stack configurations to enable conversion over a wider range of masses around 1.5 eV. The optimization was done analytically using the transfer matrix formalism. We also obtained an upper limit at 90% confidence level on the dark photon-SM photon kinetic mixing parameter under different estimates of background rates. In the experimental setup, we use a single-photon avalanche diode as our photosensor and collect counts from the sensor with and without the stack to obtain test statistics for the upper limit.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Dark Matter, Haloscope, Experimental Physics, Particle Physics, Dark Photons</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_28e457611b262d3b4613403a43a4b54e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Roberts, Henry Charles. <emph render="italic">Physics in the Service of History: An Interdisciplinary Project Between Physics and Archaeology</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0121</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_22bf50ec35fa444a9b3076c387da9fdf" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_22bf50ec35fa444a9b3076c387da9fdf" type="Folder">2021-0121</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_da11d946b0a226d79147083ce255dafa"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This interdisciplinary joint project between the departments of Physics and History centres around the development improvement of a scanning macro x-ray fluorescence spectrometer and its application in the study of archaeological and art-historical artifacts.

This was achieved by performing CPMG experiments on the samples, and using the T2 decay curves in order to arrive at a measure of proton density. For the skulls, it was found the skulls of the frozen mummies were particularly well-conserved. On the other hand, the tibia of Charlemagne and the left B16 tibia were found to be the best-conserved among the samples under consideration. The secondary aim was to determine whether the same information about the structural integrity of the bones could be ascertained from CT and mobile NMR. This was achieved by acquiring cross-sectional CT scans of the samples at the same locations where NMR measurements were made, and comparing the two. It was found that the two techniques do result in the same information about the proton density and consequently, the state of conservation.

The work suggests that many women veil for reasons other than religious obligation. Some of their reasons include veiling as a means to protect their individuality and sense of agency, a claim in direct conflict with Western stereotypes of veiling as an oppressive and objectifying practice. Do these reports signal important cross-­‐cultural differences in a perceivers' spontaneous responses to veiled women? To address this issue, the current investigation explored the rapid objectification of veiled and unveiled women by Middle Eastern and Western perceivers, using two standard measures of implicit associations. While the results did not provide evidence of objectification, they signaled the dehumanization of veiled women across cultures. Both Middle Eastern and Western perceivers considered women who veiled as less human than non-­‐veiling women. In addition, Middle Easterners also dehumanized women more than Westerners, regardless of their headgear. A second task, however, did not support these conclusions, potentially due to poor test validity. The obtained results provide tentative evidence for cross-­‐cultural consistency as well as divergence regarding the perception of (veiled) women.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Dehumanization</subject><subject source="local">Objectification</subject><subject source="lcsh">Stereotypes (Social psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Discrimination</subject><subject source="lcsh">Hijab (Islamic clothing)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Head Covers/Veils</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref80_iss" level="file"><did><unittitle>Badwan, Iman R. <emph render="italic">Intergroup Contact and its Effect on Social Identification: The Case of Filipina Workers in the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0048</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="136" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">136</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_861986f982f849c1f681f236295ea58b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_861986f982f849c1f681f236295ea58b" type="Folder">2014-0048</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_84b858688a27f87f363553fa1df5dc8a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Psychology, Visual Arts <lb/>Abstract: The possible effects of contact, relative to the interactions according to location, have been examined on group-based identities of Filipina women in Abu Dhabi and Manila.

Recent evidence indicates, however, that this processing preference may be culture-dependent. Egyptian perceivers, for instance, show the opposite face processing pattern; an effect argued to reflect their frequent exposure to faces void of external facial features (i.e., female faces covered by headscarves). To further examine this claim, spontaneous recognition accuracy for internal facial features was assessed, using a standard part-whole face recognition task, in Western perceivers living in New York and Middle Eastern perceivers living in Abu Dhabi. Accuracy scores were submitted to a 2 (perceiver culture: Western vs. Middle Eastern) x 2 (target face race: Caucasian vs. Arab) x 2 (face probe: part vs. whole) mixed measures analysis of variance. As predicted, Middle Eastern perceivers outperformed Westerners with regard to recognition accuracy. Merely on trials that required recognizing isolated face parts of Caucasian faces, both groups of perceivers performed equally well. Importantly, Middle Easterners also reported higher exposure to covered faces in everyday life than Westerners. In combination, these findings provide evidence that culture-specific face environments can impact basic aspects of face recognition.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Face</subject><subject source="lcsh">Head Covers/Veils</subject><subject source="lcsh">Hijab (Islamic clothing)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Facial recognition (Psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Cross-cultural comparison</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref59_pky" level="file"><did><unittitle>Park, Hyun Kyung. <emph render="italic">Processing Code Switch in Highly Proficient Korean-English Bilinguals</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0047</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="115" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">115</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_93d2c5c949fb2d2f45e8accc363e84fd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_93d2c5c949fb2d2f45e8accc363e84fd" type="Folder">2014-0047</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_45a74cbaa3e9880fa931ec0cedb20885"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Psychology <lb/>Abstract: Code switching is a cognitive aspect of bilingualism.

We find no effect of morphology, and posit that lexical processing, beyond determining whether an utterance is a word, requires that utterances enter consciousness before unconscious parsing can take place.

This study examines the effect of manipulating motivation on students' educational aspirations. Participants were 169 students in 5th, 7th, and 9th grade from schools in Chennai, India who completed a questionnaire that included two conditions: positive outcome focus (i.e., reaching the goal) and negative outcome focus (i.e., failing to reach the goal). After the manipulation, students reported their predicted performance levels during and after the school year. The results support our hypothesis of motivation having an effect on aspiration where students in the positive outcome focus condition reported having higher short-term and long-term aspirations. Our results also showed an interaction effect between motivation and perceived student support. Students who reported having low perceived student support had significantly higher short-term aspirations in the positive outcome focus condition than students in the negative outcome focus condition. The results might help school counselors and teachers to increase the motivation of students in secondary schools and therefore, increase their aspirations.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Support systems, Social</subject><subject source="lcsh">Manipulation (Psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Affluence</subject><subject source="lcsh">Aspirations, Student</subject><subject source="lcsh">Motivation (Psychology)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref450_dtz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mészáros, Eszter. <emph render="italic">Comprehension of Verbal Negation in Early Childhood as a Cue to Logical Inferences.</emph>  </unittitle><unitid>2016-0033</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="8018" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">8018</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_bea82bd44a386f63fa4785f46494ded7">English-learning infants were shown to have "no" in their active vocabulary for almost a year before they understand it as truth functional negation (e.g. Feiman et. al, under review).

The present research investigated the relationship between passion for academics, emotions, and cognitive performance. Results indicated that students with an obsessive passion – a strong internal pressure to engage in the activity — experienced high levels of negative emotions while taking a cognitive test, which impaired their cognitive performance. Students with a harmonious passion — a strong desire to freely engage in the activity — experienced low level of negative emotions, which facilitated their cognitive performance. Implications for positive psychology and educational interventions are discussed in the way in which positive psychology elements reduce negative emotions for harmonious passion, and improve cognitive performance. The promotion of these positive psychology elements can be done through school environments and classroom activities.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bc2ff59ebf9cbda657f8ec7dd9512114" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bauer, Ann. <emph render="italic">Interpersonal Consequences of Self-Sacrifice </emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0074</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_8e327aa7500014e7a9a08311de96409d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_8e327aa7500014e7a9a08311de96409d" type="Folder">2018-0074</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f65792f353c1c09922df3d1e273c7f03"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Significant research has been devoted to understanding the personal motivations of ideological activists.

In the following study, we hypothesized that seeking out social support during such impactful life events can predict positive perceptions of said events. We also hypothesized that participants identifying as relatively more individualistic would make more negative self-event connections due perceived low quality of social support. Our participants included 180 undergraduate students from New York University Abu Dhabi and Western Washington University representing 7 ethnicities. We used 3 types of personal narratives and 2 questionnaires—the MSPSS and the RIC scales—to collect data. Results showed that participants indicating higher levels of seeking social support during impactful life events did indeed make more positive self-event connections and participants identifying with an individualistic cultural self-aspect made more negative self-event connections. Significant gender effects were also found. Social support is an essential part of the human experience and this research was done in hopes of strengthening the scientific foundations on which we can build these arguments.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_7b707cd5235b23c9173cbdedb3bd2f1b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Meehan, Jessica. <emph render="italic">Do Attention And Visual Working Memory Share A Common Search Template?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0062</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_eacc8134df7a589f4903787f591a35c2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_eacc8134df7a589f4903787f591a35c2" type="Folder">2018-0062</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_887b7eb1257e43fd55fda1068c5ccdf6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Our ability to selectively decide on and search for a specific item in space is made possible through the interaction of two cognitive processes; attention and working memory. Recent literature has proposed that the two processes may be interdependent. Studies have shown that the template used during visual search is maintained and influenced by the contents of visual working memory (VWM). This study used a task that combines memory and search demands for a single target item. Depending on the type of trial, participants were asked to either search for the stored item amongst similar distractors, or to adjust a sample line to match the orientation of the stored item. Previous research has shown that explicit knowledge about the context an item will appear in can modulate search away from expected distractor items to improve performance. Based on these assumptions, if the search template and VWM representation rely on a single template, then adjustment away from the context in a search task will bias the representation of the item in working memory in the same direction. These findings suggest that the two tasks do not exclusively draw on a common, single template.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_abd285bef338d043612109c0e447c82a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nomani, Amber. <emph render="italic">Now You See It, Now You Don't: Effects of Interference on Unconscious Working Memory</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0079</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_2014cc1e0299c5ccd5affb0f1edc6657" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_2014cc1e0299c5ccd5affb0f1edc6657" type="Folder">2018-0079</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_38148ec458ba52d1e979406e9612c399"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Working memory (WM) is traditionally considered to be a conscious process during which information is currently being used. It is where information is held while we complete a task, or recollect an old memory. Recently, studies have shown that it is possible to maintain information in working memory even in the absence of conscious awareness. This means visual information from the environment may be processed without the awareness of the individual and we can also process them in the presence of distractors which require attentional resources. This study consists of three spatial WM tasks which aim to understand the limits on unconscious WM by testing the effect of interference, and compare these effects to the effects on conscious WM. We predicted an attractive effect of participants' responses to the object of interference in each experiment. As such, we found that there was a trend in attraction of the participants' responses towards the position of the presented sample on the current trial due to proactive interference, and also a trend in attraction of responses towards the location of the distractor due to retroactive interference. However, there was no significant difference between unconscious and conscious WM for the different tasks.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ac02d5a8e36bbbeaca301cfdb2f798b4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Omari, Deemah. <emph render="italic">Cultural Differences in Mothers' Visual Attention During Mother-Child Play </emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0058</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_6fbdcdd93850b5565fa6032ca4572685" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_6fbdcdd93850b5565fa6032ca4572685" type="Folder">2018-0058</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_caaf140cc7880b1424f1b62a9175b7a9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Mothers' visual attention plays a large role in in children's interactions during early development. Using two samples of mothers from India (n=34) and Germany (n=34), this paper explores the distribution of maternal visual attention during mother-child play. The study will tackle two research questions: (1) Is mothers' visual attention consistent in frequency across different types of play? And (2) are there cultural differences in German and Indian mothers' visual attention during free or structured play? For the first question, it was hypothesized that mothers direct their visual attention more at the child in free than structured play, and more at the object in structured than free play. For the second question, it was hypothesized that Indian mothers look more at the child than German mothers, while German mothers look more at the object. Results supported the first hypothesis, but provided no support for the second hypothesis as there was an insignificant interactional effect of type of play and culture. Culture showed a significant main effect on maternal visual attention. Implications and limitations are discussed.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c58088d3554a9b70f2c5f50344917aee" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tahan, Rosy. <emph render="italic">Investigating Early Lexical Processing Using Script Changes: Evidence from Arabic and Arabish</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0075</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_d363d71bb55d07cceb69c10c926b1444" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d363d71bb55d07cceb69c10c926b1444" type="Folder">2018-0075</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_07f96d951f1e42679667c5c4c4f5990c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In language experiments, priming, particularly in conjunction with the lexical decision task, has assumed access to the mental lexicon. However, this assumption has been challenged by findings of priming effects for pseudowords, and some researchers suggest that pseudoword priming is mediated by different underlying mechanisms which may be found using high-temporal resolution neurimaging techniques. The present study is based on Almeida and Poeppel (2013) found similar behavioral priming for words and pseudowords, but different electrophysiological responses. We designed an EEG lexical decision experiment using words and pseudowords written in Arabic and Arabish, expecting N400 priming responses and a word- and orthography-specific P2 response. We found robust behavioral priming for both words and pseudowords, but EEG results were generally not significant.

Specifically, I looked at how participants' endorsement of either hostile sexism or benevolent sexism is related to their acceptance of four types of lesbian relationships in China. Chinese undergraduate students from Sichuan province (N=550) filled out an online survey. I found a main effect of benevolent sexism, gender, and type of lesbian relationship on people's acceptance of lesbian relationships. The results showed that 1) acceptance of lesbian relationships in general was negatively associated with endorsement of benevolent sexism, but not hostile sexism, 2) compared to men, women overall found lesbian relationships more acceptable, 3) lesbian relationships with a masculine lesbian and a feminine lesbian were the most acceptable, and lesbian relationships with both masculine lesbians were the least acceptable among the four types of relationships. The results suggested that it is important to differentiate between men and women' attitudes, as well as between different types of lesbians or lesbian relationships. It also highlights the importance of studying gay men and lesbians not only as individuals, but also in relationships.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_01213bc2bc914aa2f5e062bdaa22a6c0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al-Hajeri, Jude. <emph render="italic">Examining the Lasting Effects of Daycare on Attachment Security: An 18-Year Prospective Longitudinal Study</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0085</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_c01879518f73d685369dd0561434419a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c01879518f73d685369dd0561434419a" type="Folder">2019-0085</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_882ebd147ff9533960cd23c7abb25c32"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Early childhood experiences are crucial when it comes to developing attachment representations with primary caregivers. Although attachment theory addresses a universal aspect of human development, many of its properties go unstudied. The goal of this study is to address the gap in literature by examining the enduring effects of early daycare experiences on attachment in adolescence. Thus, this study further investigates a subsample (N = 673) of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) cohort. This study examines the associations between early daycare experiences (i.e. quality and quantity) and attachment security (i.e. secure base script knowledge) at age 18 years. It was hypothesized that there would be a significant association between quality and quantity of care on secure base script knowledge in adolescence, such that higher quality care would result in positive developmental outcomes. Results indicated a small association between daycare quality and attachment security at age 18 years, but this effect did not hold when accounting for critical demographic and caregiving variables (i.e. maternal and paternal sensitivity). These results suggest that early daycare experiences are transient, leaving no significant effects on attachment in adolescence.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1d0b7f6be75e1e5d1238d6bcd5989300" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Khezam, Muna. <emph render="italic">Investigating the effect of bilingual education in the United Arab Emirates on Emiratis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0093</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_c8eecdb3f91a2a90cae6486f8ef57ba8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c8eecdb3f91a2a90cae6486f8ef57ba8" type="Folder">2019-0093</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_085872f27ccb6eceb6b076223fb60351"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) has been traditionally used in the educational setting in the Arabic-speaking world, while local dialects of Arabic are used in daily informal settings, including in the United Arab Emirates.

We conducted a survey to investigate how the effective competition between MSA-medium versus English-medium education in the UAE affects the construction of Emirati identity in nationals and their linguistic attitudes towards MSA, Emirati Arabic and English. Results indicated that Emiratis educated primarily in private English-medium schools reported a negative attitude towards MSA, but a positive view of both Emirati and English. Emiratis educated in MSA-medium public schools reported a positive attitude towards MSA and Emirati. Daily Emirati usage and promotion of Emirati Arabic in the public and private spheres were considered important to all participants, including in the construction of their personal identity. Similar positive attitudes towards MSA, however, were highly correlated with the amount of MSA-medium schooling participants had, with primarily English-medium graduates reporting only a positive attitude towards Emirati, not MSA.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_94d389f6318f860f6dca6b47edf621fc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alshuhoomi, Fatma Abdulla. <emph render="italic">Backlash against equality: How threats to the gender hierarchy affect attitudes toward reproductive freedom and violence against women</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0070</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_597233b5d66703044abef801805b53e3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_597233b5d66703044abef801805b53e3" type="Folder">2019-0070</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_20c2f5fa5a16d74817494eda85ece8dc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Desire to preserve the traditional gender hierarchy is linked to beliefs that women should be controlled non-violently (i.e., giving men more control over women's reproductive rights) and violently (rape myth acceptance and minimization of severity of sexual and physical violence).

Interestingly, all longitudinal studies on the development of attachment representations to date have been conducted in Western contexts. Leveraging data from a longitudinal study of child development in Nanjing, China, we conducted the first test of the hypothesized link between early caregiving and later development of attachment representations in a non-Western context. We analyzed data collected from subsample of an ongoing prospective longitudinal study of Chinese families (n = 78). Observations of mother-infant interactions were recorded when the infants were age 14 months. Attachment security was assessed at age 10 years using the attachment script assessment adapted to the Chinese context. Partial correlations revealed significant positive correlations between maternal sensitivity and maternal positive regard observed at age 14 months and secure base script knowledge at age 10 years. Maternal intrusiveness during play was not significantly related to secure base script development. Overall, results supported the culturally universal prediction from attachment theory that the quality of early caregiving impacts the development of a secure attachment in the child.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_dcc2b214efb8137f68c139fcd84ae900" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gyawali, Sneha. <emph render="italic">Mothers' goals and strategies for toddlers in gift reception across three cultural communities</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0101</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e9bb4bb712d7b8b584e706970fb9bcc1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e9bb4bb712d7b8b584e706970fb9bcc1" type="Folder">2019-0101</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_97084d5be1041e16807cff17d1d7a262"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The study investigates how mothers across three cultural communities describe goals and strategies for toddlers during gift reception, specifically with regard to their autonomy and relatedness.

A recent proposal implicates ensemble perception in visual phenomenology. However, a key assumption of this proposal – that ensemble perception can occur even in the absence of conscious awareness of the items in the ensemble – remains untested. To test this assumption, this study investigated whether ensemble perception of spatial location can occur unconsciously. In Experiments 1a and 1b, participants reported the average spatial location, or centroid, of ensembles of dots presented either within or beneath their threshold of conscious awareness; in Experiment 2, participants reported the spatial location of a single dot within the ensemble. We found that participants were able to accurately report the centroid of unconsciously-presented ensembles when the dots were clustered closely together, but when the dots were presented as two separate clusters, they appeared to report the centroid of a single cluster rather than the centroid of the entire ensemble. Furthermore, participants could not accurately report the location of individual dots within unconsciously-presented ensembles. Taken together, our results offer preliminary evidence that unconscious ensemble perception is possible, but limited.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6f28bb839753a986d334972c0df97385" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lee, Seoyoung. <emph render="italic">The Role of the Parahippocampal Cortex in Scene Integration</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0123</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_9358260cda19324cbaccba1d3e001e22" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9358260cda19324cbaccba1d3e001e22" type="Folder">2019-0123</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_877699f30a5e46916a7f52601e26d334"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Humans perceive a coherent visual world across time and space. To update incoming sensory information while maintaining a stable representation of the environment, previous studies have suggested the role of the parahippocampal place area (PPA) in scene processing and ensemble processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how the PPA might integrate information by relying on continuous spatial-temporal sequence of information flow, or mere shared elements in a scene. We used scene images that were divided into three segments, with 66% overlap between the first and second segments and 33% overlap between the first and the third segments. Participants viewed the three scene segments either sequentially or in a displaced order, identical segments for three times, or three completely different scenes. We found that the left and right PPA not only showed significantly stronger activations for different scenes than identical scenes, but also for different scenes than three segments originating from the same scene. Moreover, the sequence order of the three segments did not affect the response magnitude. These results suggest that although the PPA may not be sensitive to the sequence of information flow, it appears to integrate segments with shared elements to form a coherent representation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_645418ebadd54d0f3c0d56070952184d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Noll, Ella. <emph render="italic">Automatic Post-Editing for Arabic to Japanese Machine Translation</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0069</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_95dc473a45e386cdc45ba08f1ae6507e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_95dc473a45e386cdc45ba08f1ae6507e" type="Folder">2019-0069</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5cc10f6b50cba8a164f0240e02c7cabe"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Machine Translation research had made impressive improvements in the last two decades; however this success has not spread equally to all language pairs, with some language pairs receiving a lot more attention in terms of research, and resource and system development.Arabic-to-Japanese is a pair that has not received much attention.In this project, we present results from, and detailed linguistic analysis of the output of, an automatic post-editing system for Arabic-Japanese machine translation that exploits a corpus of Arabic-Japanese news articles.

This study examines the impact of objectified portrayals of females in music videos on viewers' sexual beliefs, and the potential role of sexism as a moderator. Six-hundred Amazon MTurk participants were randomly assigned to view South Korean pop ("K-pop") music videos with sexual, infantile, or neutral depictions of women, after which they responded to questions assessing their acceptance of date rape and male sexual dominance. Exposure to sexualized and infantilized(vs. neutral) videos was found to decrease date rape condemnation and increase pro-male dominance beliefs at higher levels of benevolent and hostile sexism only for women. Experimental conditions had no effect on men's attitudes. However, for both men and women, benevolent and hostile sexism were positively correlated with acceptance of date rape and male sexual dominance. Implications for objectification theory, and media and sexual violence research are discussed.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8c3fd3cfb20f4a50d5c2c985e63c9911" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yoo, Jaewon. <emph render="italic">The Eﬀect of Various Perturbation Frequencies on Reaching Performance</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0119</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_cf25561fb074d5004e6f4b6d5c175c39" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_cf25561fb074d5004e6f4b6d5c175c39" type="Folder">2019-0119</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c7f57289bba848c350d6457ad8dc0387"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We make decisions constantly, both consciously and unconsciously.

They were presented with either the unperturbed target or the perturbed target and when they were provided with the perturbed target, they were required to make online corrections in their movements to cope with the target jump. Our main focus was on the perturbation of frequency. In other words, we wanted to systematically examine how well people cope with the increasing perturbation frequency. Participants' responses were measured and recorded using a motion capture system. Data show that participants take the increasing proportion into account in the trajectory of their movements. As the perturbation frequency increased along with the progression of blocks, the initial direction moved more and more toward the perturbed target on the left, and for the perturbed trials, the participants made online corrections earlier on in the movement. This study is the ﬁrst to systematically provide increasing frequency of perturbation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5937050370531e3b543f1b084c976ad0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Zafar, Rida M. <emph render="italic">Narrative Themes and Language Usage in the Dualistic Model of Passion</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0102</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_68d6e64ee867f88138a2721e7b3fb177" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_68d6e64ee867f88138a2721e7b3fb177" type="Folder">2019-0102</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_90b5c7832e1afa92e11ccc1c7d9c54c6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Passion is commonly defined as a strong inclination towards a self-defining and highly valued activity toward which an individual devotes considerable time and energy (Vallerand et al., 2003). Vallerand's Dualistic Model of Passion (DMP) divides passion into the two distinct categories of harmonious passion – which involves an autonomous internalization of and engagement with one's passion – and obsessive passion – which involves a controlled internalization of and engagement with one's passion. The present research explores the relationship between passion and themes of narrative identity – i.e. a person's internalized and evolving life-story (McAdams, 1985)), especially with regard to the themes of agency, communion, redemption, and contamination (McAdams, 1996). Results revealed a strong positive correlation between harmonious passion and themes of communion. Obsessive passion was not significantly correlated with any narrative theme. In addition to discussing the implications of the relationship between harmonious passion and themes of communion, the present study provides a foundation for future research to investigate the applicability of qualitative analyses on psychological constructs like passion, which are usually studied quantitatively in social psychology.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f553b14916d45c6876b53d97e5e84e90" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abdujabborov, AJ. <emph render="italic">Estimating working memory maintenance-related activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0078</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_9289d48b741d67ad27b1f662e767866f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9289d48b741d67ad27b1f662e767866f" type="Folder">2020-0078</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_66b42923516fee3d42903c3cac92f1f4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The working memory field (WM) is increasingly employing multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the neural correlates of WM maintenance. These techniques are used with the delay task, which consists of contiguous encoding, maintenance (or delay), and report epochs. WM MVPA analyses use estimates of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response to the maintenance epoch of the delay task to determine whether different experimental conditions produce distinct patterns of activity due to differences in maintenance. However, because of the protracted nature of the hemodynamic response, these estimates can mistakenly capture the BOLD response to the encoding or report epochs, potentially producing false positive or false negative classification results down the line. Given the consequential nature of obtaining faithful estimates of delay activity, we evaluate and compare three different methods of estimating the delay response and identify which are optimal for WM MVPA studies.

Immigrants and immigration incite strong, divided sentiments and opinions in the U.S. population. These sentiments and opinions correspond with and influence public policy and legislation in the U.S. and hence, it is important to examine them regularly in empirical studies to develop a better understanding of which factors affect them. I analyze data from a study in which participants were either reminded of American society's reliance on undocumented immigrants or its independence from themr. I find support for the hypothesis that making society's dependence on immigrants salient can reduce negative emotions and evaluations as well as decrease support for anti-immigrant policies and laws. However, the condition did not have a significant impact on increasing positive emotions toward undocumented immigrants. I also demonstrate that this effect is moderated by political conservatism, such that conservatives were more likely to express increased ratings of immigrants' competence and warmth, decreased support for hostile policies, and reduced negative emotions. Results were consistent with previous research findings on the effects of perceived interdependence on attitudes toward immigration.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

It also investigated the extent to which the student-teacher relationship and the home learning environment mediated the association between self-regulation and academic performance, after controlling for income, gender, age, parental education and non-verbal intelligence. The Tower of Hanoi was used as a measure of cognitive self-regulation and the researchers completed the PSRA Assessor Report Examiner Rating Scale after which measured for emotional self-regulation. The teachers completed the Child-Behavior Rating Scale (CBRS) and the Student-Teacher Relationship Scale (STRS), which measured for behavioral self-regulation and the student-teacher relationship construct, respectively. The parents provided information of the home learning environment by completing the StimQ PreSchool Assessment. The Hayes macro PROCESS was used to run the mediation analysis. Results indicated that behavioral and emotional self-regulation were significantly associated with academic performance in both mathematics and language. Overall, the study showcases an uncommon sample of Kenyan children, which eventually supports the importance and understanding of self- regulation and academic performance.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

This ability is important as it helps us to function in the constantly changing environment we live in. VWM capacity has long been under investigation. Its limitations occur from noise in three stages of processing: encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. In this paper, I focus on the retrieval noise of VWM. I created an analytical model to differentiate between the shared noise of encoding and maintenance and the retrieval noise. This model was first based on data generated by a computer simulation and then on behavioral measures obtained experimentally. For the purposes of the experiments, we created a new type of VWM task. It required participants to make multiple responses about the same target item instead of the commonly used single response. Data were collected from 32 participants in two different experiments. Results from applying the analysis model on the participants' data were not significant. Nevertheless, this is one of the few studies focusing on retrieval noise, and further research with large samples is needed.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

However, the execution and planning of movements in everyday life is also aided by haptic information when objects are held by the other hand. We present a study investigating the sensorimotor integration process by exploring how hand dominance influences grasping behavior. We compare dominant and non-dominant hand grasping movements towards an object using visual or visuo-haptic information. This gives further insight on whether there is a preferred role of each hand in grasping or if there is a generic benefit of haptic information in grasping. There was no difference in kinematic data collected between the dominant and non-dominant hand in either condition, with the only exception being shorter duration in the initial segments of the movement when using the dominant hand. However, we also confirm the benefit of adding haptic signals to grasping movements to movement accuracy, as seen in the visuo-haptic condition. We therefore conclude that haptic information aids in grasping performance, and that the generic availability of additional sensorimotor signals aid in movement, as opposed to the role of specific hands.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

There, however, are further factors influencing this phenomenon. This study investigates the influence of expertise and emotional state on holistic processing. Participants were required to respond to four-letter Hungarian words. Congruent and incongruent word pairs were constructed, with the task-relevant and the task-irrelevant parts either aligned or misaligned. The factor of expertise was manipulated by recruiting native Hungarian and non-Hungarian speakers. We tested the effect of the emotional state by using words of positive and negative meaning. Both groups performed well in both valence conditions. We did not find the expected interaction between Alignment and Congruency. Congruency effect was present in both alignment conditions, which suggest obligatory processing. Valence affected the performance of novices only.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Existing research has hypothesized that EMS can be a risk factor (Stopa et al., 2001) or a vulnerability marker for depressive disorders (Dozois et al., 2009). In this paper, we use data from a longitudinal study to examine the stability of these maladaptive schemas across adolescent development. We examine whether EMS can reliably predict depressive symptoms in adolescence. Participants were administered the Young Schema Questionnaire – Short Form (YSQ-SF; Young, 1998; Brenning et al., 2012) with itemized categories to identify schema domains. This data was correlated with psychopathological information collected from a Child Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 2015; Timbremont &amp; Braet, 2002) administered to the participants. The results indicate that EMS is stable across adolescence and early-onset EMS can be used as a reliable predictor of adolescent depression.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

During home visits, 36 U.S. American mother-toddler dyads were video-recorded during free-toy play, guided-educational play and a book-sharing activity, and mothers completed Retrospective Think-Aloud (RTA) interviews. In the absence of applied RTA data within parenting research, this study adapted the teacher professional vision framework (Seidel &amp; Stuermer, 2011) to develop a coding manual investigating metacognitive complexity in RTA transcripts by classifying statements as Descriptions, Explanations or Predictions.

For a long time, quantitative Arabic sociolinguistics compared attitudes to Modern Standard Arabic and the colloquial dialects; and occasionally compared attitudes to different dialects within a country. Recent qualitative studies have started to examine the hierarchy between Western and Eastern Arabic dialects, but the status differences between the Eastern Arabic dialects are underexplored and no quantitative analysis has been done on the topic. This paper presents an indirect quantitative measure of status and solidarity rating differences between Egyptian and Emirati Arabic, as perceived by Egyptians and Emiratis living in the UAE. Results suggest that the Egyptian dialect might be uniformly viewed higher both on status and solidarity measures, at least among young women, who constituted the majority of participants and were solely represented in the stimuli. Directions for future methodological improvements are proposed to increase the generalizability of indirect quantitative language attitude measures.	</p><p>Author provided keywords:

A large body of research has provided evidence of an association between one's type of passion and their physical as well as mental well-being. However, no studies have looked into the potential relationship between passion and sleep, a vital component of overall well-being. The present study aimed to fill this gap by looking into how the way individuals engage in their passionate activities can affect their sleep quality and, consequently, their overall health. We hypothesized that individuals with high levels of obsessive passion will experience overall worse sleep quality compared to individuals with high levels of harmonious passion. We carried out multiple regression analyses to examine this relationship in a sample of 1,506 individuals who responded to our online survey, with the results confirming our hypothesis.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Specifically, observers tend to judge that a chimeric face made from two left half-faces is more similar to the original face than that made from two right half-faces, suggesting a 'left-side bias in face perception. To study the effects of long- and short-term reading experience on face processing, the present study compared native Arabic readers' (who are bilinguals) right-to-left reading direction, and native English readers' left-to-right reading direction, on their judgment of the chimeric faces that is most similar to the original face. They were tested before and after doing a reading task (reading a novel either in English or Arabic). In contrast to our prediction, all participants, regardless of their short- or long-term reading experience, were more likely to choose the right chimeric faces, suggesting that there is a right-side bias and no left-side bias, unlike previous studies predicted.	</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

As such, this study looked into pre- and post- revolution Twitter data from Sudan to explore whether the breakdown of a sociopolitically oppressive regime through protest has pronounced effects in shifting individuals' personal values. To test our hypothesis, we used the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software to analyze the language content of over 20,000 tweets produced by Sudanese users 6 months before and 6 months after the revolution. Results indicated that in the months following the revolution, tweets emanating from the Sudanese population were moving in a more progressive direction and included a lower proportion of words typically associated with "conservation" values, and a higher proportion of words pertaining to "openness" values as well as "anti- system" values. These findings offer a novel perspective on unstable political systems and illuminate that overthrowing a political regime can have far-reaching consequences on the psychology of individuals and extend beyond shaping a country's political framework.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Revolution, Sudan, Tweets, Social, Values</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_64f2707b674918a658bed572d5e60730" level="file"><did><unittitle>Aljaeedi, Nawal. <emph render="italic">Perceptual Competition Between Musical Notation and Letter Processing</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0132</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_71f1f4840566f306a335abdda2f1ee12" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_71f1f4840566f306a335abdda2f1ee12" type="Folder">2021-0132</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c68f2ce354e0c224998e33fea80d6d38"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Many forms of perceptual expertise have been examined in previous research, yet there is much less research on perceptual expertise of music. Researchers have observed perceptual interference in experts between two different object categories. We were interested to observe perceptual competition between musical notation and letter processing due to musical notes bearing meanings as letters. The goal was to examine perceptual competition in the brain between musical notation and letter processing within musical experts, though not within musical novices. We hypothesized reading musical notes and reading letters may also compete for similar processing resources, causing competition for experts, but novices would be unaffected. We tested participants online on 2 expertise tasks to distinguish skill levels, and 2 RSVP tasks, for identifying letter and symbol targets among musical distractors to observe perceptual interference within experts. We found that experts performed significantly better than novices within the letter search condition than novices. These results suggest that the experts' experience in music improved their performance in the tasks due to their encountering familiar objects than novices. Acquisition of a new skill may not compete for the same processing resources but may instead enhance performance in similar skills.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Musical notation; letters; perception; expertise; holistic processing</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1643d91f74475f48570ab4e6ea48759d" level="file"><did><unittitle>AlNuaimi, Meera. <emph render="italic">The support of multisensory information during obstacle avoidance</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0128</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_f7cb34c3f25b584d3005c67168363eb3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f7cb34c3f25b584d3005c67168363eb3" type="Folder">2021-0128</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_59e9de97d22b1698e87a1273ff9a9f60"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Vision and haptics(touch and proprioception) are essential to navigate through our environment and avoid obstacle collisions. Their multisensory integration has been shown to improve performances such as reaching and grasping. However, exploring whether or not it can help optimize obstacle avoidance –especially when the haptic input is provided by the non-target object– and aid grasping movements by reducing need for clearance around the obstacle, is limited. Here we investigated the lateral distance of the object from the obstacle, its velocity when overtaking the obstacle, and endpoint variability in an obstacle avoidance task. Participants moved the object around the obstacle from the start to end position in one condition(Visual), and did the same whilst holding the obstacle with the contralateral hand in the other condition(Visuo-Haptic). Our results showed only a moderate difference between visual and visuo-haptic information, with velocities at the obstacle being slightly higher in the Visuo-Haptic condition. In sum, holding the obstacle allows moderately faster movements toward the target position. Although these findings suggest that obstacle avoidance movements aided by only visual or both visual and haptic information are very similar, the question of whether haptic inputs from the non-target object can optimize obstacle avoidance remains open for exploration.</p><p>Author provided keywords: Multisensory integration, Vision, Haptics, Obstacle Avoidance</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_42c665afdc1d6f92ff6ab3dcafe49277" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bouhelal, Aya. <emph render="italic">In the Mind of the Passionate Ideologues: How do they Morally Reason?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0133</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_0e903c7853ce38bd950c0a226b8a5a1d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0e903c7853ce38bd950c0a226b8a5a1d" type="Folder">2021-0133</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e1da6cf3b0b096a90e6c055459dfe202"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study examines the role of moral reasoning in the relationship between passion and political activism.

We further posited that the relationship between passion and support for different political behaviors would be mediated by moral reasoning. More specifically, we hypothesized that utilitarian reasoning would mediate the relationship between OP and violent activism, while deontological reasoning would mediate the relationship between OP and mainstream activism.

Our understanding of their development from a cognitive and neurobiological standpoint is poor due to a number of limitations in the available literature including confounding effects of the ill state and flawed conceptualizations of the proposed contributing factors. The present study addressed these limitations by utilizing a non-clinical sample, a dimensional view of eating disorder symptoms, and a basic science approach to the proposed contribution of working memory (WM) in emergence of eating disorder symptoms. In a series of three experiments, we aimed to quantify the behavioral and neural association between dopamine dependent WM subprocesses and eating disorder symptoms. Although we found no significant associations, our findings have identified some differences in brain activation that may distinguish individuals with high eating psychopathology from controls. We discuss directions for further research to investigate these brain activation differences while also accounting for some of the existing limitations of research in the field of eating disorders.</p><p>Author provided keywords: working memory subprocesses, eating disorder symptoms, dopamine</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0a9b834f843aac0d1a81faef87af7982" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gurmu, Tsion. <emph render="italic">Is Selection in Working Memory Cost Free?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2021-0130</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_b2e8a0090d25f6b721f1ab2a45ea75da" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b2e8a0090d25f6b721f1ab2a45ea75da" type="Folder">2021-0130</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_69be72a9d4d3d87cec18f835a82bd80e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Attention can be directed to relevant information from the perceptual environment or to working memory (WM) representation. Research reveals that the process of selecting WM content has attention-like properties that are seen in the prioritization and de-prioritization of perceptual information. Given that ongoing attention tasks are known to disrupt WM, if the internal selection of WM content overlaps with attention, we would expect a general impairment in WM storage because of attentional selection processes. We designed a continuous delayed estimation task in which we manipulated the frequency of testing of items, thereby the selection process during maintenance of items in WM, to investigate how the process of selectively attending to items held in WM influences WM performance. Critically, we designed three retro-cue conditions in which we assess whether the retro-cue effect is present and whether selection has a cost on WM performance. We compared WM performance on the un-informative-medium and informative-medium conditions and found WM performance was reduced in the informative-medium cue condition, suggesting there might be a cost associated with internal selection of WM content.</p><p>Author provide keywords: Working Memory, Selective Attention, Retro-Cue</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d73ed2173d76acf7114098aebf2f117a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hristovska, Teodora. <emph render="italic">Neural Correlates of Working Memory and Mental Imagery</emph> </unittitle><unitid>2021-0129</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2021/2021">2021</unitdate><container id="aspace_d74cc5c7f83c8adc8d4f1ad1b09a5e1e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d74cc5c7f83c8adc8d4f1ad1b09a5e1e" type="Folder">2021-0129</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_529b743e27be7d0a2b76a6870779c69e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>People have the exceptional ability to recreate and transform visual content in their mind.

In an attempt to reconcile empirical and theoretical findings concerning the neural correlates of working memory and imagery, existing research has predominantly focused on the shared characteristics, with findings suggesting shared content of representations in early visual areas. In the current study, we aim to investigate the degree to which the two abilities overlap, by creating an experimental design which reflects the distinct theoretical constructs of working memory and imagery.

Although real-life provides plenty of cues for individuals to intercept objects and perceive their surroundings, perception in virtual environments represents a novel field that is not yet fully explored. In virtual reality (VR), motion perception can be examined through visual cues such as monocular, binocular, and the combination of both cues. Previous research indicated that combination cues provide the highest sensitivity for the observers to detect accurate motion-in-depth. Moreover, recent research has demonstrated that the addition of vestibular cues improves participant sensitivity to motion-in-depth in VR. Here, we first further explored the role of vestibular cues on participant accuracy of motion perception by entirely eliminating them and, second, explored gender as a variable in motion perception sensitivity. We first determined that visual-vestibular cue conflicts induced by mismatched display and expectation of visual consequences of head movement are not significant enough to influence participants' performance. Second, we found that participants with smaller interpupillary distance (IPD) have a higher sensitivity to motion perception. Surprisingly, our results have also shown that men have a higher sensitivity to motion perception despite their larger IPD.</p><p>Author provided keywords: motion, perception, binocular, monocular, VR</p></scopecontent></c></c></c><c id="aspace_209570724935ccbb44e160486e10ab1b" level="series"><did><unittitle>Social Sciences Division Projects</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2021" type="inclusive">2014-2021</unitdate></did><c id="aspace_ac04f3313f34b3672ad4142d19a7af04" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Economics</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref82_you" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Mazrui, Shamma Sohail Faris Ghanem. <emph render="italic">Expectations and Aspirations of Educated Emirati Females in the Transition from School to Work</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0091</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="138" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">138</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_2253a09529f9e0b9964cdce1de57ccb8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_2253a09529f9e0b9964cdce1de57ccb8" type="Folder">2014-0091</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_04523b2114d66eb7ceb710e100279319"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/> Abstract: Even though initiatives to increase the number of Emiratis in the private and public sector have been in place since 1980s, the results in the private sector are not impressive.

During this period, a rapid and deep process of trade liberalization was implemented. This paper studies industrial wage structures in a group of advanced and developing economies from 1991 to 2004. Workers' industry affiliation provides an important channel through which trade policies can affect the wage structure and inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Specifically, this paper tests whether those sectors where import penetration deepened are also the sectors in which, ceteris paribus, a higher effect on wage structure is observed. Several significant results emerge from this analysis: (1) import penetration and tariffs are more correlated with wages for unskilled workers. (2) In unskilled- intensive industries, import penetration is positively correlated with wages. (3) In skilled-intensive industries, the correlation between import penetration and skilled workers is positive only to a certain cut-off level of tariff where it then becomes negative. (4) There is an overall convergence in skilled-unskilled industry wages, more so in advanced than in developed economies.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Nineteen nineties</subject><subject source="lcsh">Imports</subject><subject source="lcsh">Trade</subject><subject source="lcsh">Trade liberalization</subject><subject source="lcsh">Wages</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref111_k71" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bassini Ortiz, David. <emph render="italic">To What Extent Has Trade Liberalization Reconfigured the Mexican Economy?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0073</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="167" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">167</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_d4f1c865cc2cd07efd20e20e5df8056c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d4f1c865cc2cd07efd20e20e5df8056c" type="Folder">2014-0073</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dc829ea056350c59fa828461762d347b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: In this paper, I look at GDP and TFP growth rates from manufacturing sectors of the Mexican Economy to show how trade liberalization has reconfigured the country's economy.

Additionally, I propose that the Chinese presence in the U.S. import market has prevented labor-intensive sectors to reap the benefits of NAFTA.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Trade liberalization</subject><subject source="lcsh">Total factor productivity</subject><subject source="local">Standard trade theory</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref81_3s0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Boutros, Jasmine Alexis. <emph render="italic">Analysis of Sector Shares of GDP During the Global Economic Crisis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0079</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="137" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">137</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_6488fc1081ef2f80f62c3bc3e7a4f9e4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_6488fc1081ef2f80f62c3bc3e7a4f9e4" type="Folder">2014-0079</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fe2dc526ca0552f285123c94082285fa"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: In this paper, I compare how the sector share to GDP of advanced, emerging, and developing economies relate to GDP growth during the crisis period of 2007-2010.

Generally, options are priced using Black-Sholes-Merton formula (BSM), but that methodology is inherently flawed: pre-supposes the lognormal nature of returns for the underlying security. Many researchers have attempted to formulate better approximations. The paper, Mixtures of t-distributions for finance and forecasting written by Giacomini, Gottschling, Haefke and White (2008), is of particular relevance where the usage of Student's t-distributions for option pricing is analysed. With fatter tails these distributions would resemble the actual stock options data more closely. However, after an attempt to replicate the results derived in the paper many discrepancies have been found. Hence, a comparison shall be made between our results and the aforementioned variations delineated.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Student's t-distribution (Statistics)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Options (Finance)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Finance</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref112_jau" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kang, Tae Young. <emph render="italic">Leaders Do Matter: Brief Analysis on Leader Constraints and Economic Performance</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0095</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="168" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">168</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_3b81b3495e20a71e4aea8d5a33445e22" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3b81b3495e20a71e4aea8d5a33445e22" type="Folder">2014-0095</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_757c909f60fb7086b9da26849c6fdf99"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: In this paper, we tried to understand the fundamental difference between democratic and autocratic systems, and after exploring the gap between the two, analyzes market performance for given autocratic systems based on the leader characteristic, represented by their exit strategy.

Pre-tax gross wage serves as the proxy to measure the quality of human capital while population by educational attainment acts as the measurement of the quantity of human capital. The regression estimation model explores the role of institutional factors such as rule of law, government effectiveness and corruption from Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) in determining wage for population in different educational level. Despite institutional factors appear to be statistically insignificant in predicting wages, prediction results enjoyed similar college premium level to actual data and related literature.

While much of academia has focused on the positive impact of remittances in the area of development, less attention has been given to the political economy implications of such unearned foreign income. Studies discussing the negative impact of remittances on government behavior have assumed that remittances encourage a sectorial glide towards greater use of private substitutes to public services (ie. private schools versus public schools). This means that an increase in remittances should be correlated with a decrease in public services. Using cross-sectional household survey data from 2004-2005 and 2010-2011, this research study shows how remittances do not have a significant economic impact on the usage of public versus private schools and hospitals in Pakistan.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Public services</subject><subject source="lcsh">Emigrant remittances</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Pakistan</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Government</subject><subject source="lcsh">Health</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref129_31l" level="file"><did><unittitle>Shenderyuk, Oleg. <emph render="italic">Pareto Distribution of Russian Stock Market Returns</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0089</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="185" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">185</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_5874c9de01ab6662840de404701cbb3f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_5874c9de01ab6662840de404701cbb3f" type="Folder">2014-0089</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b6484b472ceee44c75b700f2ae951b04"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics, Mathematics <lb/>Abstract: This thesis is looking into which statistical trends the returns of Russian Stock Index (RTS) follow.

In the sharing economy, trust and reputation not only offers a premium, but also is necessary for transactions to take place. Consequently, digital peer-to-peer marketplaces like Airbnb that facilitate these transactions must consider how their platform's various mechanisms and features impact trust within their marketplace.

Students of the university, like many other residents in the United Arab Emirates, have little incentive to refrain from wasteful consumption. The dormitory residents are divided into two groups, control group and intervention group. The control group received no treatment, whereas the intervention group signed consent forms for participation in the experiment (first type of intervention) and received letters with information of where does their electricity and water consumption stand against their peers (second type of intervention). Consent form and a sample of peer comparison letters can be found in the appendix. The results show that the intervention group consumes more electricity but less water than the control group does. The asymmetry of electricity and water consumption can be explained with elasticity of demand and change in outside temperature. The structure of the experiment is simple and transparent suggesting that such project can be implemented on a larger scale for institutional purposes.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Demand-side management (Electric utilities)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Electricity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Consumption (Economics)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Energy</subject><subject source="lcsh">Water</subject><geogname source="local">Saadiyat Island</geogname><subject source="local">New York University</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref124_pyz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Trinh, Diem Dam Trang. <emph render="italic">A new model to measure Chinese GDP An Empirical Analysis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0074</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="180" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">180</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_95c5bacd3224b68656838a7daaeeb871" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_95c5bacd3224b68656838a7daaeeb871" type="Folder">2014-0074</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b71f4010c179ba7c8230eca334667ae9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: In 2012, the Chinese economy reached $8.4 trillion, making it the world's second largest economy (after United States at $15.7 trillion). The increasing concern about Chinese statistics reliability is not a new story. There have been professional attempts to develop a proxy for the Chinese economic activities. Yet there has been insufficient justification for the reliability of these proxy variables. This paper develops a new model to measure the Chinese GDP with the reference to a cross-country analysis from 1960 to 2012. The new estimation shows that the Chinese GDP is much more volatile than the official GDP figures.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">China</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Gross domestic product</subject><subject source="lcsh">Statistics</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref109_tr0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Vaidyanathan, Madhav. <emph render="italic">The Quantity-Quality Trade-off of Fertility: An Empirical Study in India</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0083</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="165" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">165</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_f0103edfce76ee7058fbede1042cf496" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f0103edfce76ee7058fbede1042cf496" type="Folder">2014-0083</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_473a0582ba793f4e38dc5e0ca9f05c48"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: Several studies have sought to empirically test the theoretical model on the quantity-quality (Q-Q) trade-off of children in a family, first introduced by Gary Becker. Using a representative sample of data from three surveys in India (National Family Health Surveys), I conduct an empirical examination of the Q-Q trade-off of children. I use both linear and non-linear specifications of family size and study the nature of the trade-off both across time and the rural-urban divide. Furthermore, I adopt the use of an instrument (sex of the first born child) for family size to address the issue of endogeneity. My results suggest that the Q-Q trade-off holds and that the trade-off is surprisingly higher in urban areas. In addition, the trade-off appears to be declining over time, but marginally. The results have to be assessed with caution, especially when studying the estimates across time (survey) as the instrument appears to be weak and even invalid in some specifications.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Sex</subject><subject source="lcsh">Rural-urban divide</subject><geogname source="lcsh">India</geogname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref93_my5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yntiso, Sidak. <emph render="italic">Self-Confidence in Decision-Making (Experimental Methods and Evidence)</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0092</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="149" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">149</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_865583e160f218d73023e226f198906a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_865583e160f218d73023e226f198906a" type="Folder">2014-0092</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_39521bd95af217ad4142a0973df75d39"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics <lb/>Abstract: Do individuals interpret ambiguous feedback optimistically or pessimistically when their self-esteem is at stake? Ertac (2011) finds that generally people overweigh negative performance feedback which leads to overly-pessimistic beliefs about ability. If these results are valid and generalizable, more studies are necessary to study the effects and extent of pessimism. Towards this end, I have replicated Ertac's experiment with a number of differences in methodology (performance groups, signal and payment). In confirmation of her findings, after participants received an accurate yet negative signal, there was a significant pessimistic effect in belief updating. This paper also compares belief-accuracy across two types of belief elicitation mechanisms – the quadratic scoring rule and the crossover mechanism. There is no significant difference in belief accuracy between the two mechanisms.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Belief updating</subject><subject source="local">Elicitation mechanisms</subject><subject source="lcsh">Pessimism</subject><subject source="lcsh">Self-confidence</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref278_1x7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Halaby, Razan Tony Michael. <emph render="italic">Student Loans: What are the Economic Benefits of Investing in Higher Education in the United States and is it Worthwhile for Students Taking out Student Loans?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0056</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3361" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3361</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_3ea91244c7afca4aaeabf4f7b0901529" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3ea91244c7afca4aaeabf4f7b0901529" type="Folder">2015-0056</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_41e4f2ea7c0faf1b59527e604bea5645"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics<lb/>Abstract: College as an investment, is it worth it? People decide to pursue higher education because of the expectation of future economic success based on educational attainment. Assuming that higher education will have the following benefits: higher annual entry wage, lower unemployment rate and higher wage growth, many pursue it. More so, students are driven to take out loans and apply for financial aid to invest in attaining a higher education. However, will the economic benefits of attaining a higher education degree compensate for the amount of debt that student in the U.S will graduate with. This research illustrates the economic value of an education by measuring the added value of a high school or college degree.

Through the use of large, global LBO transaction details from March 1987 to September 2014, we discover that issuers and debtors of high-yield debt differ in their perception of risk, indicating debt mispricing. As private equity firms arbitrage from the mispricing, we find that they increase the valuation of their target companies by 0.0317% – 0.0486% given a decrease of the cost of borrowing high-yield debt by 1%. Furthermore, higher magnitude of debt mispricing is associated with LBO transactions of larger absolute size that exclude equity in their financing package.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Leveraged buyouts</subject><subject source="lcsh">Risk</subject><subject source="lcsh">Private equity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Debt</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref296_6vp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kang, Danyang. <emph render="italic">Effect of Information on Consumer Perception: Evidence from Restaurant Hygiene Grades Cards in New York City</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0049</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3370" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3370</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_cee603f96eb0a68c75ed7dc31b0a8fc4" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_cee603f96eb0a68c75ed7dc31b0a8fc4" type="Folder">2015-0049</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_997211e62f4dce3c93816ac9abbd31c3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Economics<lb/>Abstract: This study examines the effects of increasing provision of hygiene quality information on consumer assessment of restaurant quality.

My experiment confirms the existence of the "Identified Victim" effect in individuals: individuals contribute more towards helping an identified victim than an unidentified victim. Importantly, I extend the study to groups to find, surprisingly, that groups contribute more towards helping an unidentified victim than identified victim. Finally, the results also demonstrate that groups are less selfish than individuals: i.e. compared to individuals, groups contribute more towards the unidentified victim.

Control variables used are household size, characteristics of household head (gender, education level and occupation), household demographics (whether rural or urban), number of income earners and household facilities (including washing machine, TV, flush toilet and car); in an effort to prove that expenditure shares are allocated differently across provinces. The main finding is that having at least one tobacco consumer in the household results in a negative effect on the expenditure shares of food, education, rent and healthcare.

Falling marriage rates and increasing domestic partnerships drive up the salience of domestic partnerships as important family structures in predicting voter turnout. The paper focuses on the differences between domestic partnerships and marriages as it relates to voter turnout. The paper further explores how the effect of various turnout-predictors varies for the two relationship types. The paper shows that domestic partners are more vulnerable to negative effects of low income, low education, the presence of children, high residential mobility, and low religious attendance. The research aims to help create more efficient models to predict voter turnout, voting results, and campaign fund allocation.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c67444ce62992659aa45995f051c5da1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bansal, Tanya. <emph render="italic">CSR Trumped?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0115</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_97c3625c3e953478f5754de25d98f244" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_97c3625c3e953478f5754de25d98f244" type="Folder">2018-0115</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4041c54b64a04297e7a0aad1b4931ce8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The triumph of Donald J.

This paper examines the impact of the election on stock returns of the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P500 hereafter) constituent firms, as a function of corporate social  responsibility (CSR). I hypothesize that more socially responsible firms underperformed relative to their industry peers in the immediate aftermath of Trump's victory. To this end, I apply an event study based on regression estimation of abnormal returns using both Fama and French Three Factor Model (FF3F) - adjusted  returns and Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) - adjusted returns. I find that, contrary to expectation that high CSR firms would be "trumped" or disproportionately punished, the coefficient for the interaction between the event dummy and ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) performance is positive and  significant, meaning that mean abnormal returns increased with CSR.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_47e6c5b72a9de3b948752471da8f5778" level="file"><did><unittitle>Chandrasekar, Vishwanath. <emph render="italic">An Economic Examination of the Bitcoin Network </emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0108</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_9e3b06a3fec36e1febc73d388b9eddd6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9e3b06a3fec36e1febc73d388b9eddd6" type="Folder">2018-0108</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_262fa32dbb3e6185d4779cf4493f62cf"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper examines the Bitcoin Network through the lens of Economics.

Specifically, it assembles a new deforestation data set using satellite imagery and analyses deforestation levels for 193 cities over a period of 16 years.

Complementing this main finding the article identifies a data time trend whereby deforestation increases by 0.1% annually.   In doing so this article aims to provide data for enabling more informed legislative decisions and reducing the grey area of 'uncertain environmental effects' which often result from new infrastructure projects. The data herewith presented should hopefully aid in guiding a more sustainable and informed approach to Congo's development, one which takes greater care of the Congolese rain forests, currently occupying 46% of Congo's total land area.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_593b310639b1c58813643b5a835f17b6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ellis, Rhoshenda. <emph render="italic">The Oil Curse: Oil and Economic Growth</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0158</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_bca66b88214f3981397c6cfa5dda44f0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_bca66b88214f3981397c6cfa5dda44f0" type="Folder">2018-0158</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ca37e92f76e37cc9bf87fcfb54f99ff5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper seeks to examine the impact that the presence of oil as a natural resource has on the economic growth of a country while taking into consideration the type of governing regime.

How has the intensified import competition from China affected unemployment, regional wage receipts, and voter attitudes in the European Union, its largest trading partner?   Analyzing labor market and electoral data from 25 European countries at the NUTS 2 regional level between 1999 and 2016, I find that Chinese import competition is associated with lower general and long-term unemployment rates as well as higher regional wage receipts for the manufacturing sector and across sectors. Nevertheless, voters in the exposed regions express stronger protectionist and anti-centralization sentiments as well as more favorable attitudes towards domestic free trade policies.   I use an instrumental variable approach to isolate the supply-driven component of the Chinese trade shock and find that the results are robust to specifications that use current and lagged imports to different groups of high-income countries. The results imply that import competition from China benefits the exposed regions at the aggregate level, but still leads voters to adopt economic-nationalist sentiments.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_da3a254c0e9f6c71f84580691c6408c5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ivanovska, Violeta. <emph render="italic">Bitcoin: The Ultimate Speculative Asset?

This paper sets out to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive investigation of the price behavior of Bitcoin, the most valuable and liquid cryptocurrency in existence. The paper takes a threefold systematic approach by addressing three key questions pertaining to the unusual price evolution of Bitcoin. First, what are some long-run determinants of Bitcoin's price formation between 2012 and 2017? Second, can speculation in the Bitcoin market lend explanation for the cryptocurrency's noteworthy price fluctuations in 2017? Finally, is there any evidence of bubble-like behavior in the Bitcoin market in recent years? My results show that while variables conventionally used to study financial asset pricing do not provide much explanation behind Bitcoin's price evolution, speculation and bubble-like behavior were key contributors to Bitcoin's unusual price development in recent years.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e81ff9bbc4955e1a56690c960bfbf6e2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Juns, Alens. <emph render="italic">Beta Asymmetry in Bull &amp; Bear Markets in the Eurozone and its Applications in Spread Trading</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0111</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_db359cceefa790e3c3ae7deb2ad6c3f8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_db359cceefa790e3c3ae7deb2ad6c3f8" type="Folder">2018-0111</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_04c10b0c2c945535bc76004967baebe4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this paper I use the dual beta model (DBM) to estimate bull and bear betas for individual stocks and then compare the performance of bear betas versus standard betas in creating hedges in a spread trading strategy.

It picked up pace starting the early 2000s. In an age where virtually all countries are experiencing unprecedented globalisation simultaneously with sharp increases in income inequality, the question of a link between the two arises naturally. This paper attempts to investigate the effect of globalisation on income inequality across countries with varying income levels. It focuses on the differences between the economic development and the income levels of these countries and how these influence the impact of globalisation.    The empirical evidence presented provides support to the claim that globalisation adversely affects income inequality in Upper-middle income and Lower-middle income countries. Thus economic policy-making for these countries should incorporate considerations regarding income distribution when pursuing globalisation. The paper finds no evidence of globalisation being correlated with income inequality in High-income and Low-income countries.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_611e2ff093400577bb5ef01923112fef" level="file"><did><unittitle>KIm, Mina. <emph render="italic">Gender differences in returns to migration: Does motivation matter?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0122</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_fec40285751f24628662fe87c5e0a607" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_fec40285751f24628662fe87c5e0a607" type="Folder">2018-0122</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4bc74d4bdebf8b9d9b0c80aca075ad56"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper employs the sixth round of Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS) data to quantitatively verify (1) whether men and women select into migration for different reasons and (2) whether this heterogeneity affects their returns to migration.

Previous research on financial integration of the initial members of the Eurozone identifies a strong link between joining the monetary union and improved financial integration through bond, equity, and credit markets. This paper applies similar models related to the equity markets to a new set of Eurozone countries. Moreover, it explores possible negative effects that recessions might have had on the financial integration and accounts for other country specific factors that might affect investor behavior and hinder the rate of financial integration. By comparing various measures of equity market convergence this paper finds that the financial integration was indeed slower when the new EMU members joined the Eurozone compared to the countries that joined the EMU in 1999.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_f1704a0ac9e887b458938f2356220c7f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lama, Ugyen. <emph render="italic">Islam and Prosocial Consumer Behavior</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0131</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_1e49524e3af0bbfef33a61e0accf505a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_1e49524e3af0bbfef33a61e0accf505a" type="Folder">2018-0131</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d88e6c1714b0aea8bbd5a5371e8ca928"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) models have been widely adopted by many companies and has become core to their businesses.

This paper proposes an experimental design to study the direct effect of religion, in particular Islam, on consumer behavior and tradeoffs made in purchasing decisions. The experiment aims to study the consumer behavior of subjects who are religiously primed to trigger the Muslim identity and assess if they are more likely to pay more for products from companies known for their CSR efforts.

More recently, "self-competition" has been suggested as a strategy to increase gender parity. This study attempts to replicate the finding that self-competition eliminates the gender gap present in traditional competitive scenarios, recruiting the same sample and using nearly identical procedures as a previous study. The self-competition effect does not replicate: a weakly significant gender gap persists in self- competition and no evidence of a meaningful difference between other- and self-competition is observed. Risk attitudes predict competitive choices in all conditions, and the self-competition effect observed in the original study appears to be due to low score variance and learning effects reducing the riskiness of self-competing. The evidence suggests that policies for inequality reduction should aim to directly address gender differences in confidence and risk aversion rather than emphasize self-improvement.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c08f27b9eddce4755842b03c0cda04b2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Melkerte, Laine. <emph render="italic">Gender, Competitiveness, and University Study Choices</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0124</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_7f8976fe81db5affc9869508025daca0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_7f8976fe81db5affc9869508025daca0" type="Folder">2018-0124</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d623a551d2ff900ef0a56b89484ce0e5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The emerging literature examines whether gender differences in willingness to compete can explain the gender differences in education choices.

Furthermore, we extend the paper to the 2000s and construct a new measure of exportability. We find that the way we define export-sensitive industries determines whether aid affects the exportable manufacturing sector. Furthermore, we did not find evidence that an appreciated real exchange rate is the channel through which an aid-induced Dutch Disease occurs.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_106290691f254da01f4ee2a7e47779bf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Muralidharan, Ritu. <emph render="italic">Trade Deliberalisation and the Spatial Distribution of Firms: The Bifurcation of Bihar, India as a Natural Experiment</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0165</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_0531ac9577e0598c9baa9e8aa12203bc" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0531ac9577e0598c9baa9e8aa12203bc" type="Folder">2018-0165</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3b855a87d6b370f1948008c672bcb882"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>An inter-state tax on trade was in effect in India until 2017.

This new border was an exogenous shock to trade between Bihar and Jharkhand. We use the bifurcation of Bihar as a natural experiment to examine the extent to which trade deliberalisation through the creation of additional state borders affects the spatial distribution of firms. This empirical study uses a difference-in-difference estimation strategy and geocoded village-level data to find two key results. First, a discontinuity in the number of firms and workers emerged along the border by 2013, with lower numbers along the Jharkhand side. Second, it seems like Jharkhand was able to invest in itself to allow for the better provision of public goods along its side of the border.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8aa61d0ac23da25f8355f23d8f6ff82d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nasr, Amer. <emph render="italic">Short-Run Events and Stock Market Reactions: Early Evidence from the Economic Blockade on Qatar</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0141</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_9ac96970678bb220a091258a67433512" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9ac96970678bb220a091258a67433512" type="Folder">2018-0141</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_376e531573de26da47f3a6706d413ec1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>An unprecedented economic blockade imposed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia on June 5th, 2017 resulted in the suspension of trade with Qatar.

First, the returns of five Middle Eastern country indices are regressed upon three event windows to find that only the QEAS reacts significantly to the focus event. Second, the returns of seven different industry sectors in Qatar are regressed upon the same three event windows to find that the transportation and consumer goods and services sectors were most affected by the blockade. Third, the returns of all forty-three companies that are publicly-listed in the QEAS index are regressed on the same three event windows to analyze firm-specific return reactions over each event of interest. Although there is predictive power in assuming negative abnormal returns as a result of negative news announcements, this paper analyzes the short-run market shock of the blockade on the performance of the Qatari economy.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_fab02fec6fb54279437e0644212a8d4c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Orozco, Angela. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Mobile Phone Diffusion on The Law of One Price for Commodity Markets in Ghana</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0151</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_33d0f6d6a7c1742a5915c1b6b83dafbe" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_33d0f6d6a7c1742a5915c1b6b83dafbe" type="Folder">2018-0151</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_cb6885c4e62cbc20af725424c09a7ce6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Limited or costly information can prevent economic agents from engaging in optimal arbitrage and cause price dispersion across markets. Consequently, goods may not be allocated efficiently. As a result, information technologies may improve market performance since they reduce communication costs and allow individuals to send and obtain information quickly and cheaply on a variety of economic, social, and political issues. This paper evaluates the effect of mobile phone diffusion on the price dispersion of commodity markets in Ghana. Using geographical data on mobile phone usage as well as market-level price data, it shows that the adoption of mobile phones is not associated with a reduction in price dispersion and does not hold to the Law of One Price. Furthermore, this report dismantles the effect of mobile phone adoption for different regions and different commodity types. It finds no difference in effect between southern and northern markets and it concludes that the effect is greater for retail markets than for wholesale markets, as well as greater for non-perishable commodities than for perishable ones.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_db20b492e7ba446267b87997f42b77bb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Huynh, Nghiem Quang. <emph render="italic">Mechanism Design with Limited Attention Agents</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0133</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_efe6816ade3886ae653af3c3bc2ae15d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_efe6816ade3886ae653af3c3bc2ae15d" type="Folder">2018-133</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_dd196dd5c8206d8189c88c5e4313c72d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We relax a common assumption in mechanism design that agents never fail to consider all available options.

We propose a weaker version of strategy proofness and extend the rectangular property. We show that these new conditions are necessary and sufficient for our implementation concept.

Recent studies have found that despite the long-held view of 'the more the merrier', larger assortments have a number of important drawbacks related to an increase in cognitive costs. How is this context refined when we apply it to student motivation and the process of choosing undergraduate classes? Based on data collected from 326 students at New York University, this study proposes that individuals choosing from extensive choice sets experience lower post-choice satisfaction and increased feelings of regret. Building on the general proposition, the paper identifies additional internal factors —importance of choice, preference certainty, experience, and decision-making type— and examines whether they moderate the relationship between assortment size and choice overload. The results reveal that some internal factors do have this effect, and what's more, the impact differs between individual decision-makers. These findings suggest that assortment size alone cannot predict when choice overload is likely to occur, and raise the question of what factors influence individuals' post-choice sentiments.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5342eee6a341950bab72412c29377524" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sugita, Taiki. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Landmarks on Neighborhood Development</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0150</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_fea2921dacc1c4e6f2434546c9574bec" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_fea2921dacc1c4e6f2434546c9574bec" type="Folder">2018-0150</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_48e78694fa9d306a1aacdc832d14d680"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>New York City is often held up as a successful example of a city that underwent gentrification alongside Paris, London, and other metropolises. Past researches and case studies have examined the development of neighborhoods in the Manhattan borough but have lacked focus in other boroughs of New York City although the metropolis consists of five boroughs; Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, and Staten Island. Some researchers have used the argument that the artistic brand created by artists and galleries can spur gentrification. In this paper, I examine whether the effect of iconic branding brought by the concentration of landmark buildings in Brooklyn generate physical (1) and financial (2) development in neighborhoods. Results indicated landmark buildings caused an increase in share of residential and office units, creating an inbound of more business and people to move in, as well as a rise in value of properties in close proximity.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9fcc03c9e55f2d6faaa6984dc95cbb45" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tursyn, Ruste. <emph render="italic">Sovereign Wealth Fund Investments: Short and Long-Term Stock Price Impacts</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0143</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_0fab273440919882c5260e6770b0f154" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0fab273440919882c5260e6770b0f154" type="Folder">2018-0143</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5aa5557bcf8ab76f2208a0c071497a30"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In this paper, I studied the impact of Sovereign Wealth Fund investments on public firms in which those funds invest.

This study is the first to examine the effect of exposure to competition from agricultural imports on the performance of the domestic agricultural sector in a context allowing for insights into efficiency oriented trade policies of developing economies. Examined in this paper is Ghana's rice market, where for over a decade around 70 percent of demand has been met by imports, despite the right agronomic conditions to produce rice in Ghana throughout the year. I approach this question by analyzing the relationship between rice farm's productivity and exposure to rice imports, proxied as proximity to the coastline, where foreign rice accesses Ghana's market. Data obtained from GLSS 6 demonstrates a robust negative relationship between the distance from the coastline and farm's productivity, which on its face defies the infant economy logic and predicts higher productivity where competition is high. Yet, there are two possibilities: either farms learn to become more competitive or inefficient farms quit rice production where competition is too high. Further analysis provides some evidence for the latter theory, but more research is essential to address the puzzle.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_78a7d4a4b55161ffc7903a2845a652fb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yahia, Suraiya. <emph render="italic">Preferences in the Workplace and the Clash of Generations.

We contribute to the existing sparse literature on generational differences in the workplace by presenting a method to disentangle cohort effects from age and period effects based on epidemiology empirical research. This study shows that Millennials, especially younger members of the generation, are more likely to have higher preferences for meaningful jobs compared to Generation Xers and Baby Boomers. However, older members of the Silent generation exhibit similarly signi cant cohort effects, refuting Millennials' "exclusive" differentiation in job preferences relative to meaning. We show that while country setting and educational attainment have a signi cant effect on generational cohort variations relative to job preferences, their impact on preferences is very heterogeneous with often polarized bearings.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2c934112bc0b4526ee8f4977a73b140d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abboud, Alia Amr Ali Mohamed. <emph render="italic">Currency Devaluation and The Stock Market An Event Study on the Case of Egypt</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0143</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_4abc9514d0219b0feb420195ba0aa29a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_4abc9514d0219b0feb420195ba0aa29a" type="Folder">2019-0143</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_119c31b2f63b1208dd47e76c57d3fa8b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper studies the effect of the floating and/or devaluation of currency on the stock market in Egypt using an event study methodology.

Using vast daily data on more than 40 different crimes from 600 police stations in Karnataka, India between 2011-2016, and more than 500 cricket games of different formats from the same time span, we observe the relationship between cricket game outcomes and effects on crimes. Through our analysis, we have found that violent crime in the state goes up by a significant amount when Indian national team and/or Karnataka state team losses a game. Indian Premier League (IPL) games have bigger effects on property crimes and have not shown significant effects on other grouped crimes. The study also contributes to the general discussion of sports and crimes against women as well as ethnic and religious minorities. In the majority of the observations, except of IPL, no serious effects regarding crimes against women and ethnic minorities were found. The results provide evidence for the non-economic theory of crime, but also in some instances show effects on economic drivers of crime.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4e02fd4c1166911cb5ac4ed1c6215f7f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Anto, Keith. <emph render="italic">Undoing Racial Discrimination: An Unintended Consequence</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0204</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_3e85b91d55b5a7a874d1ff3bf8851528" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3e85b91d55b5a7a874d1ff3bf8851528" type="Folder">2019-0204</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_57e06da020094f7fad53d63fb48c15ba"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper explores serial independence of foul calls in the National Basketball Association (NBA). In 2007, Price and Wolfers found evidence for positive own-race bias in NBA referee decisions; they received great attention from the media and prompted wide criticism of referee behavior. Six years later, Pope, Price, and Wolfers (2013) found that raised awareness reduced the racial bias. Building upon this research, our paper suggests that in a conscious effort to seem unbiased and fair, following Price and Wolfers (2007), referees began to alter their foul calls based on the race of the players. They avoided long sequence of fouls on players of the same race. In our research, we find evidence for higher degrees of negative serial correlation or lower degrees of positive serial correlation in referee foul calls post-2007. Hence, in an attempt to undo racial discrimination, referees have failed to achieve color-blind decisions.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4607fc5b98911aa93b9909d75d6816c5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Assylbekova, Aidana. <emph render="italic">Entrepreneurship Education and Startup Development: The Case of the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0153</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_055a88302d98b4bca23193c659f39a4d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_055a88302d98b4bca23193c659f39a4d" type="Folder">2019-0153</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f7d7f1ebaacb6d8bac839d7d65ab6aa5"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>There has been done an extensive amount of research on the role of entrepreneurship education and startup development around the world.

The study explores the geographical variation in FDI inflows across Egypt, and uses a difference-in-differences estimation to measure the treatment effect from 2013 to 2016. Using firm-level panel data from the World Bank Enterprise Survey, the study uses intensive measures of entrepreneurial activity: firm sales and no of employees. The paper bases its choice of variables on the notion that, like new firms, many incumbent firms display entrepreneurial activity through growth in sales and size (Ahmed &amp; Hoffman, 2008). With approximately 4,000 entries, the paper controls for different sets of regressors, to minimize omitted variable bias. Overall, the results either display negative or insignificant effects of FDI on entrepreneurship. These results are consistent with findings in earlier firm-level papers like Konings (2001), De Backer &amp; Sleuwaegen (2003), and Barbosa &amp; Eiriz (2009), and are in line with the crowding out theory.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1809fbfc3a2b8d02bf5c926e662eefa1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bambysheva, Nina. <emph render="italic">Carbon Trade and Labor Markets in the European Union</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0139</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_72045ef9532d2bb66da8885417311c80" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_72045ef9532d2bb66da8885417311c80" type="Folder">2019-0139</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_56510f280a9fba9a99daee36ac2f91b1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Attempts to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change through various carbon pricing mechanisms consistently raise concerns over increased production costs and job displacement.

Differently from the previous literature, we test the effect of both primary and secondary ETS market on employment rates across the EU member states.

By 2017 around 2.5 million Polish citizens emigrated, creating a supply shortage in the labour market.In 2013 this situation started to change with a sudden increase of the number of immigrants from the former USSR, mainly Ukrainians, entering the Polish labour market. Their number reached 1.6 million in 2018.The immigration phenomenon coincided with a period of rapid growth of the Polish economy, leading to a lot of speculation about the role of the immigrants in the economic development of Poland. This Capstone Project explore the economic effect of immigration in Poland by approaching the most controversial part of it, namely the wage effect in the labour market. The methodology used in the project leads to a rejection of the hypothesis stating that the presence of immigrants has a negative effect on the level of Polish wages.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_00d8e35e10e2c8972aedf251cbcdf1b4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Benoit, Valentin. <emph render="italic">Professionalization of UAE-Based Art Galleries and Their Evolving Role as Cultural Entrepreneurs</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0183</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_aa19fe42bc76bb44db5f5b6f6523078e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_aa19fe42bc76bb44db5f5b6f6523078e" type="Folder">2019-0183</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c8ecd60dfa8dee5f3cebe78fd06b77ee"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This qualitative investigation studies the emergence of the UAE art market by focusing on the developments of the primary art galleries.

There is extensive debate and literature that suggests that adaptation funding will come ultimately from the residents of developed countries via taxation. This paper, however, studies the willingness to pay (WTP) for adaptation from glacial flooding among university students in Nepal as a way to explore if residents of developing countries can fill the funding gap for climate adaptation. By eliciting WTP using a contingent valuation method, I see that university students in Nepal exhibit a positive value for funding climate adaptation. Consistent with other studies, I see that gender and level of income have a significant influence on the WTP value while information treatment does not. While the positive WTP value among students of developing countries can be used to fulfill the funding gap, it also highlights the urgency to which adaptation funding is required in vulnerable communities.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_39962d5c5576c51b786f9fb2bcbfb4ec" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bin Jaafar, Aldana. <emph render="italic">The Real Cost to Wed in the United Arab Emirates: A Study on the Economic, Educational and Cultural Determinants of Mahr in the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0197</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_86a49600585ccf566bc7c3ef7aef519b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_86a49600585ccf566bc7c3ef7aef519b" type="Folder">2019-0197</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d5af30c9361c07f6bfbbfb08606d6378"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Although it is widely discussed that dowry amounts in the United Arab Emirates have been on the rise, what influences such a change is yet to be understood.

Over 1,500 observations were gathered to test for (1) assortative matching, (2) effects of a bride's characteristics on the size of dowry and (3) effects of a groom's characteristics on the size of dowry. Results reveal that there is a high degree of positive marital sorting by education, social hierarchy and wealth. Moreover, in a marriage market, women can bargain for a higher dowry or a spouse through their mannerisms (i.e. social hierarchy levels and educational attainment). Contrarily, the characteristics of men that are observed to have a significant and positive effect on the size of a dowry are considered to be materialistic (wealth and income levels). The results highlight important influencers of dowry size that will hopefully lend a helping hand to policymakers in impeding further dowry inflation in the UAE.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0fb447439ece79e09ffe264f0f7f13a5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bolysbayev, Daniyar. <emph render="italic">Wage inequality in Football Association: the case of English Premier League</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0205</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_fca3e3b029d5274a7c645bf4c32d937c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_fca3e3b029d5274a7c645bf4c32d937c" type="Folder">2019-0205</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_514ae373a575b99a2a23e9f6a88f4e3d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper tests for the existence of nationality, race and skin tone wage discriminations amongst players in the English Premier League.

The paper is chiefly concerned with the determinants affecting the token success defined as an aggregate of measures, including per-currency market capitalization. I propose that the most indicative analysis should be primarily based on a scrutinous examination of the network structure of the cryptocurrency-issuing companies. I believe the presence of the bonds among the employees of the coins, established through various incidents of shared employment noted in their job history, has an impact on the success of the firm. With the data from LinkedIn, a professional career-oriented website, used in the cryptocurrency field as a primary medium of promotion, I show that economic success of firms positively correlates with their centrality measures in the network. The analysis concludes the network structure of a company is a significant factor of success and can be used to predict the outcome of a particular coin.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_07b01b2dc9a7b92f1c8fda696662aa05" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cereceda, Flavia. <emph render="italic">Smart and Attractive: Exploring the Relationship Between Smart Cities and Migration</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0188</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_c56cb6f10b27f56432d9e7982e4e5f8c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c56cb6f10b27f56432d9e7982e4e5f8c" type="Folder">2019-0188</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2ff766acbc43086764b12edd79e51340"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper explores the relationship between a city's level of smartness and its net wave of migration.

The most important result is the positive but weak correlation between migration and smartness using the Principal Component approach.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6ce20db5440a68ffb3b09c1ed67cdac0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cho, Gene. <emph render="italic">Surfing the High Seas: Factors that Influence the Decisions of Internet Users to Download Movies</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0189</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_c3b8c99aa31a06a8d8353aee6a3c4bb6" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c3b8c99aa31a06a8d8353aee6a3c4bb6" type="Folder">2019-0189</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6470dd438ee11e3e4630607a694231a1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>While global cinema and TV revenues have fallen over the past two decades, downloading online movies for free has become increasingly common among the youth in the past two decades. Using survey data from current NYUAD students, this paper investigates how nine factors influence the likelihood and the extent of downloading. Budget constraint has a positive correlation with the number of movies downloaded in the past 6 months. Budget constraint, social norms, and attitudes regarding fairness are statistically significant influence on the frequency of downloading. Budget constraint and swiftness of legal punishment are statistically significant predictors on the last time users downloaded. The only variable that was a consistent statistically significant predictor of the likelihood and the propensity of downloading was budget constraint.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_745efa905cb002026985cb49b504851c" level="file"><did><unittitle>Deryng, Laura Aleksandra. <emph render="italic">Bitcoin and Beyond: Effect of Regulations on Development of Cryptocurrencies</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0136</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_0d7ec6270d18ef835a8bcda5df455eeb" label="Microform" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0d7ec6270d18ef835a8bcda5df455eeb" type="Folder">2019-0136</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_84afd1e99800a5031dbfdaa11fa5d8ab"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The increasing popularity of Bitcoin attracted the attention of the governments worldwide, which decided to impose various regulations on digital assets.

We find that a hub airport has a significant impact on the attractiveness of a city for foreign investors. These results are robust to the implementation of a long-term difference which enables to control for potential remaining unobserved factors of the attractiveness of a city. According to our estimates, building an airport leads to 11% more inward FDI in the city.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9097006e1d47a8b523da9f673ee38f5b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Fujii, Shinichiro. <emph render="italic">Heat and the Ability to Play a Game:Evidence from Professional Tennis Players</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0161</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_4d783bfc5247da9d8e195cfd14786947" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_4d783bfc5247da9d8e195cfd14786947" type="Folder">2019-0161</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f8381f9865295691cea66c83fff0fc21"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>There has been no study to show a correlation between heat and human cognitive ability to play a game.

The hypothesis is that improvements on logistics performance offers competitive advantage for sectors that employ logistics heavily and therefore causing sectoral specialization trends as logistics intensive sectors grow relative to non-logistics intensive sectors. Generalized-Least-Square analysis is used for the panel data consisted of 63 countries across 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2014. Some statistically significant result supports the hypothesis and shows improvements in logistics performance has expansionary and contractionary effects on the relative size of sectors that use logistics intensively and those that do not use logistics intensively respectively. The results suffer from endogeneity, but instrument variable methods cannot be applied appropriately because of the limited data available.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_af3cae51e9f07c8a12b4f27f0f0abe02" level="file"><did><unittitle>Haloglu, Fatih. <emph render="italic">Emerging Markets as an Asset Class and Investors Behaviour</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0150</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_b0abbd2fd775c6e111022ea538491ba0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b0abbd2fd775c6e111022ea538491ba0" type="Folder">2019-0150</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0f14953304aac17c75cb4f19cc5eee23"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>We assess the factors that investors take into account when reacting to financial shocks across Emerging Markets (EM), covering four (4) key episodes of EM-wide financial stress since the mid-1990s to 2018: i) the Mexican "Tequila" Crisis of 1994, ii) the South American Economic Crisis of 2002, iii) the Argentine Economic Crisis of 2018, and iv) the Turkish Currency and Debt Crisis of 2018.

By using a simple two-person voting game, we find two equilibria one of which is trivial and one of which is responsive to the specific information provided for a voter. We implement the Fehr-Schmidt utility function which allows voters utilities to be inequity averse by incorporating the "shame" and the "envy" components. Ultimately, we find that this equilibrium is robust to this inequity aversion.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_17ef5b247ad9b2e1644294f83d2a9545" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lebedeva, Alina. <emph render="italic">Capital Structure Choices in the Middle East: The Case of the UAE Firms</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0138</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_954d3bb7557688b8461e93000b7bb34b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_954d3bb7557688b8461e93000b7bb34b" type="Folder">2019-0138</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3d0f9ff5cd38c909a41e03a55c7d42de"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Financial markets of the Middle Eastern Arab countries have long evolved under the influence of the local culture and religion.

Communes are the smallest French territorial divisions and since 1982, raise a substantial part of their budget on their own following a
national policy on fiscal and administrative decentralization. The Ile-de-France region counts 1276 communes as of 2018 (INSEE) and offers the ideal set-up for a case study with the capital city Paris being at its center and it
offering data on many observable economic variables. The central question driving this thesis is the extent to which the public budget collected by every municipality is affected by the standard of living of individuals in that very circumscription. I hypothesize that living standards should consistently predict, across
time, budget size. If that hypothesis holds, the implication is that richer communes would get a higher budget per capita, therefore feeding into a cycle of positive cash recycling (i.e. more infrastructures and productive public goods). The poorer communes, where are located most of the banlieues and a large immigrant and second-
generation immigrant population, would then see a widening inequality gap in terms of available funds and therefore opportunities for social mobility. The findings point towards the existence of a time lag between living standards and budgets as well as a two-way causal relation; I find that income levels and quality of education
corroborate my main hypothesis. However, the data shows that the government is intervening to level up the budget inequalities through equalization schemes.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5dbf69dcdf72e78a67673b551793f21f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Papadimitriou, Esmie. <emph render="italic">Gender Differences in Loss Aversion</emph>

Buyers not only are consumers, but also act as intermediaries as they reproduce the good at zero cost and resell it to other buyers they have access to. Sellers indirectly appropriate profits from buyers along intermediation chains, but also enter into competition with buyers who replicate and resell. A network partition captures the effects of monopoly power versus competition. We extend the analysis to investigate the effects of limited resale opportunities on a seller's captive market and profits. By generating a directed network, we find that restricting resale expands sellers' captive markets when a network is su�ciently well-connected. Meanwhile, restricting resale limits diffusion and generates competition between buyers. As a result, a seller may be unable to extract profits from every buyer within his captive market, but he may obtain more than his bilateral monopoly share when the threat of dealing with the next highest-value buyer is credible. We find a formula to compute sellers' profits when there is no uncertainty in diffusion paths and competition between buyers does not interact with competition between sellers.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2e5ec24acbb8d53cfd02c3a5ed55e2e4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Radinovska, Veronika. <emph render="italic">The Impact of Infrastructure Development on Economic Growth: Evidence from China</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0194</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_99d9160beb6047f081c27ef066727d77" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_99d9160beb6047f081c27ef066727d77" type="Folder">2019-0194</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3f4eebdaea25e5345784b333ed0b3253"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>China has demonstrated incredible overall economic growth in the past four decades, yet, regional development of the country has not been balanced: economically developed East drastically contrasts the rural West. By studying China, a country that transformed from an agricultural giant into a global innovation hub in less than 30 years, yet still demonstrates presence of significant regional disparities, this project aims at assessing the relationship between infrastructure development and economic growth in various provinces of China. In this research, the focus is on hard infrastructure and how presence of paved roads, city bridges, and street lights contributes to economic development. A comprehensive and up-to-date dataset from 1998 to 2017 is used to assess the relationship between fluctuations in infrastructure development and economic growth while accounting for endogeneity.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ce8bf537275beaa81514da65ea3608c9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rosso, Nicola. <emph render="italic">To What Extent Are Chinese Takeovers in Europe Value-Driven?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0201</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e9ca6ef04467499df7c84de9f6fe8edf" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e9ca6ef04467499df7c84de9f6fe8edf" type="Folder">2019-0201</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5798efff77471ca3740fe449395f4b37"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A growing number of acquisitions of European companies by Chinese entities in the last few years has fuelled a vigorous debate in Europe over the economics of such acquisitions and over the long-term geopolitical implications of this phenomenon. The European Parliament has recently passed a regulation to implement a European mechanism to screen inbound cross-border takeovers and various European leaders expressly address the phenomenon as a threat for Europe's independence and stability. This research contributes to this debate by showing that European companies acquired by Chinese ones in the past decade have performed in line with comparable companies in Europe. It therefore advocates a cautious treatment of the geopolitical concerns without nonetheless forgetting the benefits provided to society by a lively market for corporate control and by successful company acquisitions.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_68035991743e6739feb1bd3a7d490fdc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Shahi, Keshar. <emph render="italic">Long Run Economic Outcomes of Ancient Nomadic Travel Routes in the Highlands of Asia</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0169</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_423ba661555a5011eedf9eff8c99811a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_423ba661555a5011eedf9eff8c99811a" type="Folder">2019-0169</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e8f446649c87935221dd652086f2a9e3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Works on the impact of transportation infrastructure are primarily comparison studies across periods or location setting (rural vs. urban). These works fail to include how a location's geographic (terrain) characteristics might influence the emergence of economic activities. Similarly, the conventional narrative among these existing works depends on the construction of actual transportation infrastructure which leads to a lack of exogeneity variation in the studies. This paper confines the study to a fixed geographic setting (Asian highland) as it faces its own sets of challenges and barriers to infrastructure development. To overcome the lack of exogeneity in the study, we use simulated travel routes taken by nomadic pastoralist for hundreds of years in the region as a proxy for the transportation network. We make use of nightlight intensity, population density, locations of road networks, and cities' locations to study how closely contemporary economic activities are established around the ancient travel routes. We find that there are positive economic outcomes in the region where simulated travel routes existed suggesting a long-lasting positive effect of infrastructure development on the economy.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_212a5e661a14cc4e8c9ea72ccbcace5a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ttappous, Michael. <emph render="italic">A Hedonic Price Analysis on the Impact of Macroeconomic Policies on Residential Rental Listing Prices in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0130</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_a096bd683527e5d402b8fa642eb86789" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a096bd683527e5d402b8fa642eb86789" type="Folder">2019-0130</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d0f8aef1779ddc929e72dfc4007a12d2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This capstone explores the economic impact that macroeconomic housing policy decisions have had on residential rental listing prices in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi.

What effects do housing-related government policies have on these prices? By employing hedonic price analysis, this paper confirms the following Hypothesis: Macroeconomic policy changes relating to housing have had substantive impact on residential rental listing prices in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. This paper presents evidence that, for the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, the implementation of housing fees for non-citizen residents and the introduction of a relocation policy have had statistically significant impacts on rental listing prices for both Apartments and Villas.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4807e039ba8e5147edd1d6e22a73b489" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wilemborek, Stanislaw Henryk. <emph render="italic">Influence of Macroeconomic Indicators on the Spread Between Emerging Market and US Bonds Between January 2008 and December 2017</emph> </unittitle><unitid>2019-0166</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_779c1ea1428089a1260fff47faa09c6a" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_779c1ea1428089a1260fff47faa09c6a" type="Folder">2019-0166</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a1760841e221b47b0a687bfa04dd4fc9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper analyzes the impact of macroeconomic indicators on spreads between yields on Emerging Markets and US bonds.

With more coverage and decreased out-of-pocket percentage, there is both an increase in appropriate and necessary health services rendered as well as an increase in inappropriate and unnecessary services. Higher out-of-pocket payments also mean people either use medical services fewer times or that people are more incentivized to take better care of their bodies in order to pay less for health services. The methodology of this study is multiple statistical regressions on key health indicators and out-of-pocket percentage with varying control variables. Fixed effects regressions were also used to better eliminate the different intra-country effects on results. The results of this study find that increased out-of-pocket percentage of health financing increases health according to the key health indicators, with 4 of the 6 health indicators being statistically significant. Other findings include more statistical significance in wealthier countries that spend more on health expenditure than less wealthy countries, as well as no statistical significance between geographical locations.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b163763441acd08e9539954156224706" level="file"><did><unittitle>Yates, Thomas. <emph render="italic">Energy Investment in Developing Countries: Trends and Determinants</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0152</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_697e5e9c824b68ca95aa3c87d7e7f98f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_697e5e9c824b68ca95aa3c87d7e7f98f" type="Folder">2019-0152</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ce840fa0e069ca666f44bc396cb2df3a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Developing countries are set to drive the world's additional energy consumption between now until 2040. With climate change a major threat during this time period and linked to the use of non-renewable energy, the burden to invest in renewable energy lies upon developing countries. Yet, they face the dual challenge of expensive renewable energy sources combined with enticing Chinese investment opportunities in non-renewable energy sources. In this report, I analyse the energy investment trends of developing countries between 2014-2018. I then use regression analysis to understand the determinants of investment in renewable energy in these countries, of which energy consumption, energy shortages, and Belt Road Initiative participation are found to be significant variables.

(2017) claims that one cause for gender differences in labor market outcomes may be that women are more likely than men to receive and accept tasks with low promotability. Using a lab coordination game similar to the game of chicken, they argue that women have higher probability of volunteering than men and that such behavior is influenced by subjects' belief that women are more likely to volunteer. The experimental design labelling the volunteering task as "invest in a group account" raises questions on whether framing affects gender differences in the game and whether the conclusion is robust in a more diverse population. We applied three frames to the chicken game and conducted an online experiment. Our results show that framing increases volunteer rates for both genders but does not affect gender gaps. We also find that women indeed volunteer more than men across treatments and that women are more likely than men to expect their female colleagues to volunteer.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4af29180f3ca51a28d637884d5e097eb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Adeney, Jack. <emph render="italic">Would You Risk it All?

Providing the opportunity to reject an offer more than once reduces total payoff because of time frictions, yet only allowing one rejection results in a significant reduction in trade frequency. In a laboratory experiment, buyers and sellers are asked to play different bargaining institutions of varying high type probabilities and time horizons. Findings suggest that participants are sensitive to increases in high type probabilities, as shown by an increase of both trade frequency and payoff. Although individual payoff rises, delay and inef- ficiency remain present even in games of non-severe adverse selection. When given the option of bargain type, buyers eventually tend towards the one-shot bargain, yet are not capable of consistently providing an offer that would ensure trade with the seller. As a result, buyers do not extract levels of individual profit equal to that of the ex-ante expected payoff. Behavioural preferences for loss aversion and fairness also play a significant role in determining how efficiency is distributed between buyer and seller.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

This comparative analysis will be divided across three levels: (1) Macro overview of cultural attraction using cultural and economic indicators; (2) aggregate percentage breakdown of artistic workers; and (3) yearly activity of established creative workers relative to other fields over time. My research contributions extend to analyzing macro-level relationships between economic and cultural indicators, outlining the most prominent professions within the arts and culture core sector, and producing the short-term differences in differences visual on notable culture-core workers relative to other professions for Kuwait and the UAE.

Regional income disparity is measured by the standard deviation of Gross Regional Product per capita across each country. This metric is then introduced into the multivariate regression model featuring additional economic and political variables. The model supports the hypothesis that the magnitude of regional income disparities have a positive impact on the electoral manifestation of Eurosceptic attitudes, although with a statistically insignificant result. The positive effect of regional income inequalities on Eurosceptic votes is especially pronounced in non-Eurozone countries.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

However, little is known about consumer support for efforts aiding refugees, and even less within the context of the Venezuelan refugee crisis. This paper uses an online survey to gather data and measure consumer willingness to pay for efforts supporting Venezuelan refugees in Colombia. I also implement a priming mechanism through a sentence-descrambling exercise in order to increase saliency and sensitization to the crisis in Colombia, and measure its effect on respondents' generosity, empathy and willingness to pay. I find that priming robustly and consistently increases respondents' levels of generosity and empathy. However, such effects do not extend to significant increases in consumer willingness to pay. Taken together, these findings suggest a clear disconnect between self-identification with generous and empathic attitudes and real willingness to monetarily support programs aiding Venezuelan refugees. As a pioneer in the field, this paper opens the discussion of consumer attitudes toward supporting this crisis and highlights the urgency to motivate an integrated approach to refugee aid by understanding consumer support for such aid efforts.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

This paper fails to reject the hypothesis that the usage of Healthcare ICT has no effect on the change in the number of patients seen and patients treated.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

A strong economic incentive to convert forest land for other uses presented governments with a trade-off between the economic and environmental value of the natural forests. This paper examines the impact of trade openness on deforestation per a given level of income in 1990- 2015. I create an instrument based on the gravity model of bilateral trade flows to account for the possible endogeneity of trade. I also estimate the model separately for countries with high and low levels of agricultural exports. I find no significant relationship between trade openness and deforestation but report consistent evidence that the Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis holds true in the case of the deforestation.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

The four activities, influencer marketing, social media advertisements, giveaway events, and sales promotion, are identified as the main social media marketing activities that the company has allocated its resources the most. Their impact on drivers of customer equity, which are brand equity, relationship equity, and value equity, are examined. The result identified specific features of the social media marketing activities that have significantly positive effect on customer equity, providing suggestions for the marketing strategy of the firm.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Following these findings, substantial debate and academic research explored discrimination in the mortgage market by looking at the probability of rejection for a mortgage as well as the mortgage rates different groups pay. Furthermore, research revealed that in periods of recession, minority groups are adversely affected with regards to labor market conditions. This study investigates the effect of changes in the business cycle (as demonstrated by state unemployment rates) on the differences in mortgage rates paid by: White men; White women; African American men; African American women; Hispanic men; and Hispanic women. Using data from the Federal Housing and Finance Agency and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the results suggested that Hispanic Females and Males pay the highest mortgage rates on average when controlling for several characteristics including borrower credit scores. The results also revealed that if anything, Black males get the most favorable rates on their mortgages. Finally, the paper revealed that white males and females were the most sensitive to changes in unemployment rates. </p><p>Author contributed keywords:

These matches are driven by matches with people they have not identified in the network, hinting at an information barrier to growth.

There are 28 Commissioners within the EC, each of whom has been nominated by their national government and confirmed by the President of the EC. Every Commissioner holds a specific portfolio, and some of these portfolios, such as Energy and Internal Market, have scopes directly tied to specific industries. Therefore, EU laws initiated by Commissioners with such portfolios directly affect firms within those market sectors. While Commissioners are obliged to be free of national bias, prior qualitative studies have suggested the existence of national interests in the work and decision-making processes of the EC. Thus, this research seeks to empirically answer whether commissioners are biased towards firms from their national countries. To study this, this research employs the event-study methodology and stock market data to test for the presence of abnormal returns in national stock markets in response to two market shocks. The test found no significant market reactions to both market shocks, therefore concluding that there is no significant empirical evidence for national bias among Commissioners with key economic portfolios.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

In case of Poland, the manifestation of liberal vs. conservative ideology follows the West-East divide, inherited from the partitions of Poland in the 19th and 20th centuries. I hypothesized that societal conservatism has a negative impact on individuals' earnings, based on the theoretical framework that conservative beliefs imply that people pay less attention to money and more to family and community. In this Capstone, the econometric model tests the relationship between variables obtained for all 380 counties in Poland. First, I develop a standard OLS model, with average salary as dependent variable, and selected measures of conservatism and liberalism (respectively: relative number of marriages and family size, and relative number of singles and divorces). Then I extend it to include instrumental variable of city status for each county. The results for both Eastern and Western parts of Poland support the hypothesis that conservative ideology is negatively correlated with individual earnings.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

The data in use is trade and investment data for 17 developing countries over 12 years from 2005 to 2017. The research finds that Chinese investments have a small negative but statistically insignificant impact on trade of the receiving countries. We also find that the investments have a strong positive impact on redirection of trade of these developing countries from other places to China. Even though China does not seem to specifically target indebted or resource-rich countries to create a deeper "debt trap" or get involved in "new colonialism", in terms of trade, they are still the only party who benefits from these investments. This trend, however, does not appear in all sectors of an economy. The energy sector, for instance, is one of the industries which benefit from Chinese investments. </p><p>Author contributed keywords:

By using the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) measure, a cost-comparison of three energy inputs (natural gas, solar energy and hydrogen), with unequal lifespans and power capacities, was conducted. In a hypothetical hydrogen production scenario, the paper finds that the UAE Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) would approximately range between 4.8 – 2.8 $/kg H2. The findings show that hydrogen gas and solar power act as complimentary inputs to energy generation and that hydrogen deployment is economically feasible due to existing and planned large-scale solar power plants in the UAE. Furthermore, an energy policy of removing subsidies from the UAE natural gas sector is assessed. The paper attempts to discuss the policy by introducing a technological shock, such as hydrogen, to the solar energy sector using a partial Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model. The reasoning shows that such an energy policy can smooth out energy price fluctuations caused by the disruptive impact of substituting natural gas with hydrogen gas for the long-term.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Our findings suggest that in the short run, investors react adversely to such events, especially with the CEO's business misconducts that directly involve the company operations, but the adverse effect is less significant for non-business scandals. However, when we do post-estimation test, there is no significant difference in investors' response between the two scandal types . While the non-business scandals of "me too" nature (which include both extra-marital affairs and sexual harassment of female employees) has no significant effect on stock returns, we find there is a negative and significant effect on stock markets returns of sexual harassment misconducts. This paper contributes to the existing literature by considering CEO's scandal events that are not necessarily business-related but also concerning non-business, immoral behaviors. </p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Our findings suggest that investors in most industries react adversely to the occurrence of hurricanes. Based on the number of industry portfolios that are significantly affected, we find that the economic implications of a hurricane have become more severe in the past three decades and that investors react more aggressively in the states across the East Coast &amp; Florida than they do in states that border the Gulf of Mexico. Our last finding shows that the scale of financial damages incurs ex-post has no proven effect towards the market reaction.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

This paper experimentally varies economic status, inequality and knowledge of inequality through the initial endowment of games played in an experiment in Argentine classrooms. It is found that individuals randomized to the extreme ends of the spectrum of privilege behave more prosocially than those in the middle, forming an inverse u-shape in generosity. However, knowledge of inequality appears to attenuate prosociality. Finally, the inverse u-shape is not observed using observational data accounting for the socio-economic status of students. This paper experimentally validates both directions of socio-economic status effects on prosociality, but only in the case that inequality is unknown.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

This is implied by the effect of Trump's tweets related to the US-China trade war on the daily treasury yield curve rates from the start of the trade war till September 2019. The collected tweets were classified into 2 categories: whether they bring good or bad news about the US-China economic conflict overall. The average effect of an additional standard deviation of "bad" tweets is around negative 4.83 bps (for the 2- to 5-year maturity bonds) on the same day and around negative 5.07 bps a day after (for the 2- to 10-year maturity bonds). A multitude of tweets that bring bad news would decrease the yield on the 10-, 20- and 30-year maturity bonds by negative 22.4 bps, on average, on the same day. These results convey that market participants could believe that President Trump's trade policy is recessionary and will be difficult to revert in the future.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

This is as a result of the country's colonial history, which first brought African slaves and then Indian indentured laborers to replace labor- deficient plantations after the abolition of slavery. Since this period, latent ethnic rivalry has been documented between the two groups. The complexities of the ethnic relations in Trinidad and Tobago causes some questions to arise regarding the implications of its colonial history on ethnic relations between the two groups and on the economic outcomes of the groups today. The goal of this paper is to determine whether perceptions that ITs enjoy a higher standard of living today when compared to ATs is actually true by devising a unique measure of standard of living (SOL) which amalgamates various household characteristics for the time period 1970-2011. The findings show that between 1970 to 1990 ATs are relatively better off compared to ITs. However, after 1990, ITs seem to be relatively better off than ATs.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Data for this experiment was collected online using Qualtrics as a survey platform and includes 372 Muslim participants in India for which data was collected online using Qualtrics. Participants who were primed with religion were biased against the non-Muslim charity and donated a significantly lower percentage of their earnings to this charity. Otherwise, there were no other significant treatment effects, which could be explained by the violence between Hindus and Muslims in India at the time of the experiment creating strong religious and ingroup sentiments among the Muslim population in India. Nonetheless, there was a correlation between survey measures of religiosity and donations. In particular, participants who scored higher in the religious activities and stance on Islamic issues dimension donated larger shares of their earnings to charity. There was also a significant gender and age effect as women and older participants donated more on average.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

The paper also deduces that refugees do not significantly affect the agricultural labor market, but have a positive, significant, and almost equal effect on employment in the manufacturing sector and employment in the industrial sector.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

The paper focuses on AR-15's,notable for the amount of media attention it receives in and out of the US. This is done due to time and data constraints, as well as the relative newness of the AR-15 market. The model this paper constructs also integrates the level of criminal demand in Mexico, as measured by the number of homicides.

This paper uses the event study methodology to evaluate how announcements of tariffs and negotiations affected equity markets in either country during the "war". Results indicate that equity indices have mixed reactions to the news, as the American market performs as expected while the Chinese market does the opposite. Possible reasons include uncertainty, differing index composition, and asymmetric information.

This form of bankruptcy allows firms to emerge from bankruptcy and continue operating, retaining much of their staff. Labor unions take part in the bankruptcy negotiation process by obtaining seats on creditors' committees; employees in firms without labor union presence are not otherwise represented in bankruptcy negotiations. This paper studies the effect of labor union presence on firms' likelihood to emerge from bankruptcy and subsequently survive for five years. I find that labor union presence is positively correlated with emergence from bankruptcy for large, public companies. No significant correlation is found between labor union presence and survival for five years after bankruptcy.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Through prediction modelling and regression analysis using interaction variables and fixed effects, I anticipated that the exogenous introduction of Netflix and Spotify in LAC would increase financial access due to subsequent increases in digitalization, op- erationalized as cell phone subscriptions and internet users. This study finds, counter to my hypotheses, that for a majority of LAC countries, the digitalization intervention that occurred with the introduction of the biggest players in the consumer subscription service industry had a non-positive effect on financial access. I find that LAC could be missing an opportunity to improve financial access through mobile digitalization, as lower classes are not equipped with the financial or technological literacy necessary to best utilize it. The threshold effects at play in LAC mitigate the potential eco- nomically egalitarian effects of increased financial access. This investigation provides a cautionary tale for governments looking to advance financial development by increasing digitalization without creating inclusive financial policy to support it.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

While there are many studies investigating the impacts of specific forms of irrigation, little is known about how irrigation, broadly considered, affects the outcome of female labor force participation. In this paper, we perform a descriptive study of female labor force participation in India, followed by a causal analysis on how it is impacted by irrigation. We find that irrigation shares a statistically significant and positive relationship with female and male labor force participation. Our analysis suggests that the effect of irrigation on labor force is smaller for women than for men. This research is an important first step in understanding the priorities faced by female farmers with regards to labor force participation.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

Understanding these effects has profound implications on economic theory, particularly in the field of labor economics, and policymaking. This project hopes to contribute to the literature on this topic. I use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics dataset from 1997 to 2007 to study the effects of wealth and wealth shocks on the wage rate, annual labor income, and working hours. With a set of six specifications, I find that these effects are all statistically insignificant at the 0.01 level. When they are occasionally significant at the 0.05 level, the effects are small. The results suggest that the wage rate, labor income, and hours of work are, for the most part, not influenced by wealth and wealth shocks.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

All in all, the South Korean overall market moved according to our hypothesis while the U.S. one did not. Specifically, the South Korean market showed a decreasing cumulative abnormal return following the events while the U.S. market did not respond. Defense industries from both countries have responded positively to the North Korean provocations. Among ten inter-Korea cooperative industries, six have responded negatively towards the events following our prediction, two have not been impacted, and two have moved in a positive direction. There was an overriding issue of deriving significance out of the results except in two industries: U.S. defense and South Korean road construction. Investors should not expect that all the inter-Korea cooperative industries would behave in the same ways and must be aware of the differences in respective industries.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

The study begins with an overview of understanding contemporary sex work, namely through discussing the key schools of thought in sex work debates, as well as the often-neglected but massively important topic of indoor sex work. Indoor sex work is discussed at length to discuss its potential as the most viable form of sex work for an environment where the practice is legal. After this discussion, three case studies are addressed, discussing the relationships between their respective legal systems and how sex work operates in each society. The case studies (the Netherlands, South Africa, and Sweden) are chosen to illustrate points on a broader legislative spectrum with regards to sex work. The study concludes by noting the immense differences in the needs of each case study with respect to improving their legal systems so as not to increase sex worker victimization. Additionally, it is concluded that none of the legal frameworks discussed represents an ideal scenario for sex workers, but each offer insights on how to improve sex work legislation in general.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_3d66ab7fa1ff8d9b22c40ca4ecc81bc2" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Political Science</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref133_oph" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bolton, Brett Michael. <emph render="italic">Introduction to Continuous Voting</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0066</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="189" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">189</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_f0af81f3797f254ad8cf35a7a6b00704" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f0af81f3797f254ad8cf35a7a6b00704" type="Folder">2014-0066</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6dead9825770ff177f068b68b6057fce"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science <lb/>Abstract: Continuous Elections are the election methods of governing systems that do not have set term lengths or election cycles, but rather employ a fluid voting system where individuals may cast, retract, or change their vote at will and, consequently, potentially cause a new outcome at any time.

We engage in what is thus far the most comprehensive discussion concerning the theoretical underpinnings of this method, as well as, its potential merits and shortcomings.

Although in the '90's the Hungarian Republic was built upon the ancient concept of the Separation of Powers, now, merely two decades later, this model seems to be deteriorating. Many blame the 2010 Parliamentary elections that concluded in the landslide victory of the conservative right-wing party, Fidesz, and their consecutive Constitutional reforms for this deterioration. Furthermore, there is a number of other, often less obvious changes in the state structure that redistributed power from the executive and judiciary branches to the Parliament and thus allowed uncontested governance for Fidesz. In this paper I intend to investigate the state of the Hungarian Separation of Powers model to determine the extent to which the legislature has usurped powers formerly reserved to the other branches. This analysis may also have implications for other young and transitional democracies (anocracies) around the world.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><title source="local">Veto Players</title><subject source="lcsh">Electoral systems</subject><subject source="lcsh">Separation of powers</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Hungary</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Democracy</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref84_frb" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gellai, Daniel. <emph render="italic">Roma Race: The Racialization of Roma Identity in Hungary</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0070</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="140" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">140</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_c49f9dffd3d705cc3f0870d6a20c0760" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c49f9dffd3d705cc3f0870d6a20c0760" type="Folder">2014-0070</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_80e6216cae03592947c87b5628eb1338"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science, Middle Eastern Studies <lb/>Abstract: This paper examines how racial identity is constructed by analyzing the legal framework that the Hungarian State devised for Roma affairs in the last decades. The examination of how the Hungarian legal system shapes and constructs Roma identity reveals how national and ethnic identities are part of "classificatory struggles" and what consequences those struggles can incur. Even though State laws and the legal framework do not explicitly mention racial categories, they do set the Roma apart from the majority and only a minority of them can perform the identity that the state assigns. The need to identify them can thus perpetuate other markers, e.g. racial features, for which there is historical precedence and empiric evidence.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Roma (People)</subject><subject source="local">Legal systems</subject><subject source="lcsh">Minorities</subject><subject source="lcsh">Race</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref100_qmp" level="file"><did><unittitle>Karaulova, Daria. <emph render="italic">The Impact of Civil War Violence on The Education System in Nepal</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0071</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="156" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">156</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_b43111cf58889a30d7fd7a09ba389fa8" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_b43111cf58889a30d7fd7a09ba389fa8" type="Folder">2014-0071</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_77fb4a6aa31c6d9bebaf65931e392b29"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science <lb/>Abstract: Nepal suffered civil war violence over the course of ten years, from 1996 to 2006.

This paper seeks to explore some of the ways that a country's wealth influences its likelihood of providing peacekeepers. I theorize that the UN's fixed monthly payment per soldier provides more incentive to developing countries to supply troops, than it does to developed countries. Therefore, I look at the relationship between a country's wealth, the interaction of wealth and military capacity, and the interaction of wealth and proximity to a conflict on the country's peacekeeping supply. I find that wealth in itself is a poor predictor for supplying peacekeepers. However, the interaction between wealth and military capacity is a good predictor: Poorer countries show an increase in troops supplied with an increased defense budget, while there for richer countries is no effect. Lastly, rich countries in unstable regions seem to be less willing to supply troops than rich countries in stable regions. I conclude that the UN's fixed monthly payment induces poorer countries to contribute more troops than their richer counterparts.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">National income</subject><subject source="lcsh">Security policy, National</subject><subject source="lcsh">International relations</subject><subject source="lcsh">Peacekeeping forces</subject><subject source="lcsh">United Nations</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref108_ph0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Underwood, Stephen Ross. <emph render="italic">Don't You Forget About Me: A Rational Choice Model of Presidential Legacy</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0093</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="164" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">164</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_067b3dc4e62aa8f2e521eec1b03074ab" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_067b3dc4e62aa8f2e521eec1b03074ab" type="Folder">2014-0093</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3c5a6db18bb43a7cc5d877c93c25873d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science <lb/>Abstract: Presidential legacy has been studied for the last 50 years with no framework, model, or theory in which legacy is broadly understood and conceptualized.

I then apply rational choice theory to this model to produce a framework by which I characterize the interaction that forms legacy. This model implies a relationship between the net effects of former Presidents on present utility and retrospective presidential approval. I test this relationship empirically using a novel responsibility assignment measure.

When the economic recessions happen, it is possible that the people from Eurozone countries are more likely than the people outside of the Eurozone to attribute the economic failure to European Central Bank (ECB) instead of their domestic governments because their national governments do not have direct control over the regional monetary policy. However, this paper shows that such leniency in fact did not exist when the 2009 Eurozone economic recession happened. In other words, the public does not accept a membership of the Eurozone as a legit excuse of a national economic recession. Furthermore, the paper has found that in fact there is a negative association between the use of Euro and the public satisfaction towards the national government after the financial crisis broke up.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Politics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Recessions</subject><subject source="lcsh">Euro</subject><subject source="lcsh">European Union</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref276_f93" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dickson, John. <emph render="italic">Capture the Flag: How Flag Exposure Affects Social Value Orientation and Nationalism</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0051</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3360" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3360</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_ee1e96589eb3c7304242a201c52e3a67" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_ee1e96589eb3c7304242a201c52e3a67" type="Folder">2015-0051</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f8aa6557a12eaff0f81d628361e46b22"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science<lb/>Abstract: This study examines the effects of exposure to national flags on individual social value orientations and levels of nationalism. An experiment is put forth which primes individuals with a flag of their home country and then tests to see if this prime affects participants' behavior and motivations. Empirical evidence shows that exposure to one's national flag significantly reduces one's social value orientation, with the individual acting far less altruistically. There is also considerable evidence that there exists a placebo effect for how group symbols can influence social value orientation.  This study also finds that flag exposure does not have a statistically significant effect on nationalism. These results are explained in the context of Social Identity Theory, with the further conclusion that more research on this topic needs to be conducted.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Nationalism</subject><subject source="lcsh">Social identity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Social values</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref302_qge" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hu, Yuanmo. <emph render="italic">A Kantian Account of the "War on Terror"</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0059</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3373" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3373</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_c389152e3bc44c451d9bd1a23bf8ee5e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c389152e3bc44c451d9bd1a23bf8ee5e" type="Folder">2015-0059</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_01420e8447e5ab21a97319c98da6b043"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science, Philosophy<lb/>Abstract: The September 11 terrorist attack on the United States of America gave birth to the term "war on terror." Since the definition of terrorism is a matter of heated contention, this paper first attempts to give a definition of terrorism in the context of the U.S. "war on terror" from the four perspectives of actor, motive, method, and target. This paper then offers a moral judgment of this war applying the ethical theory of Immanuel Kant, by putting terrorism, the means and methods of the war, and the legitimacy of revenge under the microscope of the Categorical Imperative. Based on a progressive assessement on these three steps, this paper concludes that the "war on terror" is not morally permissible.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Morality</subject><subject source="lcsh">Terrorism</subject><subject source="lcsh">Wars</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref280_lh7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kabanga, Kefa Ambale. <emph render="italic">Do Political Institutions and Competition Really Matter?

The theory suggests that leaders who require a larger minimum number /proportion of people to keep power, provide more public goods. Using sub-national variation in Kenya, this study utilises the methodologies of Jensen (2009), Bueno de Mesquita and Smith (2009), and Chhibber and Nooruddin (2004), to test the arguments posited by Selectorate Theory with respect to Public Good Provision. These methodologies are compared against Electricity Provision, Healthcare Provision, Education Provision, and forms of Local Government Expenditure. This theory is contrasted against the other theoretical and empirically tested explanations in the variation of public good provision, namely the importance of ethnicity. The findings of the first two major tests do not corroborate the theory's predictions, pointing to corruption and an absence of accountability allowing public agents to treat nominally public goods as functionally private ones. The findings of the third major test indicate that selectorate logic generally applies, but fails if there are homogenous preferences amongst parties on the provision of highly visible public goods, indicating that 'politics' do matter.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Politics</subject><subject source="lcsh">Public institutions</subject><subject source="lcsh">Public goods</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Kenya</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Elections</subject><subject source="local">Selectorate theory</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref274_vsh" level="file"><did><unittitle>McDougall, Rory Morton. <emph render="italic">Examining Voting Patterns in Lebanon: Why the March 8th and March 14th Alliances Matter, Not Religion</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0057</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3359" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3359</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_89d4fbd743a6929dc6b711d2433f552e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_89d4fbd743a6929dc6b711d2433f552e" type="Folder">2015-0057</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_a1f4762bc4da780419278d094e9667e3"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Political Science<lb/>Abstract: Despite the Lebanese Parliament extending its term for a further three years until 2017 due to political conflicts and instability, Lebanon is one of the few democratic countries in the Middle East. It is also one of the most religiously diverse countries in the world and this diversity is reflected in the number of Lebanese political parties, which are often aligned under religious banners. It has been very difficult to examine the impact of religion on voting in Lebanon though due to limited government data and the limitations of survey data. However, the election results from the 2009 election offer a new perspective into Lebanese voting patterns. Using a homogeneous precinct model, the election results show that voters do not vote along religious lines and instead the allegiance to an alliance – either the March 8th or the March 14th alliance – is critical in determining voting with the exception of the Shia community. Furthermore, Lebanese voters are polarised within their religious communities with the vote often split between the two alliances.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Religion</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Lebanon</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Elections</subject><subject source="lcsh">Ethnicity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Coalitions</subject><subject source="lcsh">Voting</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref460_4cu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ha, Bora. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Foreign Aid and Natural Disasters on Civil Violence: Comparison of Cross-national Findings and the Case of Aceh, Indonesia.</emph></unittitle><unitid>2016-0050</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="8056" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">8056</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2016/2016">2016</unitdate><abstract id="aspace_4f43a414c59bef32f9db5a4e1306cf74">In conflict regions, the role of foreign aid and the occurrence of natural disasters may have significant effect on the outcome of violent incidents.

Using cross-national data, I first provide evidence that countries with greater gender parity have higher scores of happiness and life satisfaction, even after controlling for income and health. I then focus on the case of the UAE, where the government has actively promoted gender equality and economic opportunities for women. I use a survey experiment of approximately 400 Emirati nationals to explore how the promotion of gender parity affects each gender. Specifically, I try to understand whether increased happiness of women due to the promotion gender rights is countered by declining satisfaction of Emirati males. My survey includes several treatments of hypothetical situations to answer this question. I find that promoting female happiness raises overall happiness, as male happiness does not decline equivalently. Due to the prevalence of strong conservative gender norms in the UAE, I investigate some implications of the government's promotion of gender equality. My findings demonstrate that because Emirati women have equal opportunities in the UAE's development, this empowers them and allows them to reach their full potential, thus allowing them to be happier.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_64822c51579213cc2d10d31316599b52" level="file"><did><unittitle>Asifa, Charlotte. <emph render="italic">The determinants of domestic and sexual violence: Evidence from the Congo </emph> </unittitle><unitid>2018-0145</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_a1620b4e07966ab7f803fd049f93ddfd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a1620b4e07966ab7f803fd049f93ddfd" type="Folder">2018-0145</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2b8eb56fd987617b2ff5818d17486039"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>What are the determinants of sexual and domestic violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo? This work aims to obtain the population that experienced domestic and sexual violence in the DRC and predict the determinants for such violence. I use the initial 2011 base survey data collected for the community driven reconstruction program, Tuungane. Using the list experiment that uniquely controls for the sensitive nature of domestic and sexual violence, I attained the portion of the population that experiences sexual and domestic violence. I use the t-test statistical method to estimate the determinants. The results showed that approximately 33.3% of the population experience sexual violence and 24.8% of the population experience domestic violence. The strongest positive determinant of sexual violence was female productivity and conflict associated with pillaging and the presence of armed groups. The strongest positive determinant for domestic violence was conflict associated with the presence of armed groups. Female productivity was a weak determinant for domestic violence.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ee667305a43e9303c5267442645998e1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Bolgari, Irina. <emph render="italic">Bandwagon Voting: Differences Between Policy Referenda and Candidate Elections</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0110</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_d2fae1867f0e9b082e7724e34a096432" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d2fae1867f0e9b082e7724e34a096432" type="Folder">2018-0110</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5b712fc8def0c26762cded46d7098318"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper examines the manifestation of bandwagon voting behavior comparatively in two experimental treatments: candidate elections and policy referenda.

This goal is accomplished by applying empirical findings on what motivates bandwagon voting, other-regarding preferences and psychological factors to the experimental analysis of the two treatments. The comparative study of the treatments shows that voters engage in bandwagon voting more frequently during the candidate elections treatment. The fact that both psychological factors and other-regarding preferences affect voters in the context of candidate elections explains the higher levels of bandwagon voting manifestation in the treatment.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_50d7d0e2d7a1a32bae00b6fe082e6adc" level="file"><did><unittitle>Braunsteiner, Aron. <emph render="italic">'Toking' Initiative: The Role of Ballot Initiatives in the Policy Diffusion of Medical Marijuana Laws</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0106</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_bd6227bb1b5374d8920d4fccc8194232" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_bd6227bb1b5374d8920d4fccc8194232" type="Folder">2018-0106</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fbcb3c08d9aef8d99bec95ef261f220c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Medical Marijuana Laws (MMLs) have been spreading in the United States for over 20 years. There are currently 29 states that have adopted a MML. What were the factors that led to the spread of this policy? When California legalised Medical Marijuana it was through Proposition 215 in 1996, a ballot initiative. This paper investigates the role ballot initiatives have played in the further adoption and diffusion of MMLs using event history analysis of MML adoptions between 1996 and 2012. I find that the presence of ballot initiatives increases the likelihood of adoption for moderate states with medium scores of liberal citizen ideology by as much as 10. I propose the mechanism that policy entrepreneurs bypass their legislatures, which are reluctant to pass MMLs unless they are very liberal, through ballot initiatives. I also find that the role of ballot initiatives has been decreasing over time, adding to the theory about their importance in the initial innovation process. I propose that as the positive policy outcomes of MMLs become more apparent establishment pressure against them fades and more states start adopting them, the role of entrepreneurship, and therefore ballot initiatives decrease and give way to other modes of diffusion.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_e2aec7e11adfe77cc14c713b7a173651" level="file"><did><unittitle>Headley, Tyler. <emph render="italic">The Politics of Health</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0161</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_f2698c87f11f2bb336a3c89407ddc80f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f2698c87f11f2bb336a3c89407ddc80f" type="Folder">2018-0161</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c1076fff7ea6f9803228b9b5d234264a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Societal inequalities create a health gradient wherein the richer and more powerful have better health outcomes, such as higher life expectancies and lower child mortality rates, than the poorer and less powerful.

This Capstone proceeds as follows: first, I introduce the subject of public health and inequality, and describe how political Science can contribute to this subject. Second, I present three co-authored articles that serve as the core of my Capstone. The first article is a novel exploratory study on the economic costs associated with dengue illness episodes in international travelers. The second article analyzes a prospective cross-sectional cost-of-illness study at Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children, Colombo. The third article is a bottom-up micro-costing study of the hospital-level costs associated with dengue cases.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_cf53cc1e1fef14ded3b75d0cd57c6b1b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hykpo, Marie-Claude. <emph render="italic">Voting At The Extremes: A Study of Far-Right Support in France.

Through an analysis of electoral support for the Front National based on the results of the latest French presidential elections (May 2017), this paper aims to determine which factors influence the likelihood of supporting the Front National at the commune level. We test three different hypotheses regarding key variables which have been singled out by the existing literature as main drivers of the Front National vote; namely the presence of immigrants (Immigration), the Unemployment rate (Unemployment), the completion of a higher education degree (Higher Education) and the level of inequality (Inequality). We find that high levels of Higher Education, as well as low Unemployment, are associated with lower levels of support for the Front National; while high levels of Inequality and low levels of income both correlate with an increased Level of Support for the Front National. This paper also uncovers unexpected and negatively correlated relationships between the Level of Support for the Front National and both Age and Immigration. Moreover, the introduction of Change in Immigration overtime as a variable also reveals interesting correlations with the Level of Support for the Front National.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_966f6e178577fc36dae66ef78e728799" level="file"><did><unittitle>Igono, Victor. <emph render="italic">Regime type and National Health Policies: A Study of National Healthcare Expenditures in Sub-Saharan African Countries</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0140</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_6630b98c3f4673c63324d749d08c62f3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_6630b98c3f4673c63324d749d08c62f3" type="Folder">2018-0140</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1491fc8c98d42a8256656f1a071da191"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Does regime type influence health policies in sub-Saharan African countries?

This paper seeks to answer the above questions by studying healthcare expenditure patterns among governments of sub-Saharan African countries. It combines a quantitative analysis of expenditure patterns among 44 African countries with an in-depth case study on two countries. The paper finds support for the positive effect of democratic polity on increased healthcare expenditure. Thus it argues that democracies dedicate a greater amount of resources to the healthcare of their populace vis-à-vis non-democracies. This is because democratic leaders have a greater incentive to provide public goods to a large section of the population in order to gain or maintain political power in the face of frequent challenge in a free and fair electoral system.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bc97e47412b005f6e7cc522f5e75d740" level="file"><did><unittitle> Jo, Hyun Woo. <emph render="italic">Political Regionalism in South Korea: An Empirical Analysis</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0137</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_254a77399c13567551b5d0e32c38682c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_254a77399c13567551b5d0e32c38682c" type="Folder">2018-0137</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e2d81704190bd19937d0d648f3461dbc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Previous studies on political regionalism in South Korea have pointed to the economic disparity between Yeongnam and Honam regions as a core reason.

I analyze if states with higher scores on the Human Development Index (HDI), an indicator that looks beyond a measure of simple GDP, are associated with lower rates of firearm related deaths. This is primarily to add scope to the bulk of cross-national literature that traditionally limits focus to factors such as gun ownership and mental health, and contribute to the literature connecting Health, Education and Income to crime and suicide. I find that when state-fixed and year-fixed effects are controlled, the relationship between HDI and Firearm Related Deaths becomes insignificant. Despite this, the Education Index of HDI maintains a negative relationship with Firearm Related Deaths when tested individually. As such, my findings suggest that focusing government policy on improving Education Index of a state may have positive implications on gun violence. My results also show that when controlling for HDI and Law Enforcement Officer rates, the Strength of Firearm Legislation has the strongest negative relationship with Firearm Related Deaths.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_caeefdf5a6e4650815f423afca294296" level="file"><did><unittitle>Klinar, Stjepan. <emph render="italic">The Sectoral Effects of Brexit on the US Economy: Early Evidence from the Stock Market Reaction to the Brexit Vote</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0163</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_1eccf81c452deaffe35f57cb8f8771bf" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_1eccf81c452deaffe35f57cb8f8771bf" type="Folder">2018-0163</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e2865c115fa5b402e159954556d13c73"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper explores the impact of the Brexit vote on publicly traded firms grouped by sectors.

Using the market model event study methodology, I assess the effects of Brexit on stock market prices in the US stock market, relative to what had been anticipated as measured by abnormal returns (ARs). The results found no significant effect on the stock market as a whole. However, I observe significant heterogeneity of impact across sectors. Five sectors appear to be affected in particular. Utilities and Healthcare sectors experienced positive abnormal returns, while the Automobile, Business Equipment, and Banking sectors experienced negative abnormal returns. The positive abnormal returns observed in the Utilities and Healthcare sectors persist after 7 trading days; on the contrary, negative abnormal returns persist only in the Business Equipment sector. These findings indicate that Brexit had a mixed effect on the US stock market with apparent sector-by-sector differences.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_25f671066c3af9552b688fec5dddea41" level="file"><did><unittitle>Lino, Rafael. <emph render="italic">The Effects of Environmental Grievances on Legislative Elections in Brazil </emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0152</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_2e884654306af57f4234be56da435305" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_2e884654306af57f4234be56da435305" type="Folder">2018-0152</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_795631850a9ea9a383cf5575dce57ab0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper explores the relationship between deforestation in municipalities of the Brazilian Legal Amazon, and voting preferences.

I capitalize on the unique Nationally Determined Contributions to find evidence on whether the regime type of a country affects different measures of its policies presented for the Paris Agreement of 2015. I look at four measures in the Nationally Determined Contributions, namely policy type, unconditional and conditional emission reduction targets, and aggregate adaptation targets. My results reveal that policy type is largely unaffected by regime type. There is evidence that democracies in the high income quartiles have higher unconditional and conditional emission reduction targets than autocracies and anocracies. Furthermore for aggregate adaptation policies levels of corruption turn out to be a key driver, where less corrupt countries have lower aggregate adaptation policies. I infer that policy type reflects the Common But Differentiated Responsibilities principle of international law. Democracies, facing double audience costs, commit to higher tangible and monitorable targets, such as emission reduction targets. However, since aggregate adaptation policies do not lend themselves to clear monitorable mechanisms, they are used by more corrupt countries to compensate for expected international audience costs.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6abed4fefc38822098cbe169cf9e4eb2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Murphy, Kelly. <emph render="italic">The Legacy of Involuntary Resettlement on Political Behaviors: Evidence from Kenya</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0155</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_cfa0627db782be73ceb94c2a50008d02" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_cfa0627db782be73ceb94c2a50008d02" type="Folder">2018-0155</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b77ff45c0a3fad2146de79f1b8cf9a02"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Involuntary resettlement affects millions of people around the world, from those displaced by natural disaster or development projects to those fleeing economic distress or conflict.

In this paper, I contribute to the growing literature by studying the nature of distributive politics and how it plays out along the lines of public educational resources. I posit the question of how and when educational resources are incorporated into the strategy of distributive politics to achieve electoral gains. I look at this question by referring to the case study of Hungary. Using datasets from the Hungarian Ministry of Education and National Election council and implementing a Regression Discontinuity Design, I argue that the recent financial centralization of the public educational system made education more susceptible to political manipulation through allowing the channeling of funds to schools in swing areas to gain electoral support. I find some evidence that the manipulation of educational resources by the central government is present after the centralization in Hungary. However, this pattern is only present in the case of the number of teachers available, and not economic indicators, such as the number of computers or building quality.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_cb6663a4d36f5149b66069824bc8b817" level="file"><did><unittitle>Roopra, Simrat K. <emph render="italic">Conflict, Modernization, and Perceptions of Traditional Leadership: Evidence from the Democratic Republic of Congo</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0114</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_f3891f57aba6ac81566aa530c673f0cd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f3891f57aba6ac81566aa530c673f0cd" type="Folder">2018-0114</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6a1630d151d6f762d3212163bcc2158e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This research seeks to understand how traditional-governance institutions are perceived by rural constituents during a time when conflict is dynamic and when modernization is on the rise. In places to where the modern state struggles to project power, are chiefs still seen as legitimate in light of these social phenomena? This is a gap in the literature that the current study aims to fill by exploring the effects of conflict and modernization on perceptions of traditional leaders in the DRC. This study uses cross-sectional data to conduct regression analyses to understand how conflict and modernization influence villagers' perceptions of a chief's legitimacy, specifically his competency, representativeness, and trustworthiness. The data used was collected between 2010 to 2012 from 816 villages in four eastern DRC provinces. Results from regression analyses suggest that chief trustworthiness is negatively affected by conflict and modernization, competency is unaffected, and representativeness is negatively affected by modernization. These results indicate that in response to evolving social conditions, traditional leaders are still seen as legitimate in certain respects. This suggests that chiefs are still a viable governing unit and that efforts should be made to strengthen the institution by improving the chief's representativeness and trustworthiness.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_285f7b0c504338ab4e9abf82fc5f8a3e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Almarzooqi, Omar. <emph render="italic">Understanding the Successes and Failures of Regional Blocs: The Power of Institutions</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0203</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_c96cf733944a913ec76fd434e57a9b90" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_c96cf733944a913ec76fd434e57a9b90" type="Folder">2019-0203</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_47c00d604416c48c066e65f89a39de87"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The paper attempts to address the mechanisms by which regional blocs fail or succeed.

Linking together literature and data on precolonial centralisation in Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda, and individual levels of education, I find a strong positive association between my centralisation variable and coethnic voting. The long-run effects of precolonial institutions, however, do not appear to be driven by clientelist relationships of trust toward a traditional leader or belief that a leader should help his own community. Some evidence, however, shows that this relationship could be driven by norms of respect towards authority. An interaction between my centralisation and education variables overall shows that centralisation matters more than education though these differences are small.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ba28d9356b00efc5c5cbe2738a5b03ca" level="file"><did><unittitle>Estes, Jocilyn. <emph render="italic">Confucius Institutes in the United States: Crouching Tiger or Hidden Dragon?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0141</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_9de0f5a5a267795d59195fe5d0761ccf" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_9de0f5a5a267795d59195fe5d0761ccf" type="Folder">2019-0141</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ca831820819eb9c9444f83b818f5fb27"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>World powers tend to export their ideals and agendas to mold the international status quo. The soft power methods that China utilizes to establish influence in other countries align with the idea of its peaceful rise. One instrument of this soft power strategy is the Confucius Institute program. These institutes are cultural and language centers at universities around the world, run and subsidized by the Chinese government. Research has suggested that increasing investment in public diplomacy programming through Confucius Institutes represents an attempt at establishing influence overseas in a non-confrontational manner. Others maintain that institutes constitute a national security threat by targeting universities that conduct dual-use research. This study examines a novel dataset of over 2,000 university-level observations including both Confucius Institute host and non-host institutions in the U.S. It finds that universities with large Science and research programs, and large enrollments are more likely to host institutes. As the first empirical research aimed at assessing the strategy behind Confucius Institutes in the U.S., this project acts as a preliminary examination of an ascendant power's informal diplomatic activities with citizens of a rival.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_61b2b0866ca4577b386584e0bad4bdcf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ismail, Donia. <emph render="italic">Political Changes and Piety: Religion as Public Discourse in Urban Egypt</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0177</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_75c45a45d300eaef16114bb4eb90437b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_75c45a45d300eaef16114bb4eb90437b" type="Folder">2019-0177</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e12b77bfc2639130cd925d898b153362"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In the Arab Middle East, the prevailing assumption is that religion shapes politics. Questions relating to the capacity of political changes to trigger various religious sentiments are often overlooked. This is especially true within Political Science scholarship. Through this project, I aim to answer one fundamental question: what are the effects of political shocks on religiosity amongst urban Egyptians? Observing this relationship in the specific context of Egypt allows me to interrogate the fluidity of the boundary between religion and politics. The events of the Iranian Revolution, the first Gulf War, the Invasion of Iraq, the Arab Spring and the Coup d'état represent the political shocks of interest. I then test for the effects of these shocks in relation to an observable element of religiosity: the figure of the veiled woman. By examining the veiling trends collected on one popular women's magazine, this capstone contributes to the construction of a time-series on the evolution of religiosity. Despite the absence of statistical significance for some findings, the overall study demonstrates evidence that counter the linear narrative attached to religiosity in Egypt.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9bdeafd96491aee2899a73fd4fbfc1c6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Johnston, Maria Caeli. <emph render="italic">Political Engagement in Europe: What Groups of Voters are More Interested in Politics and Inclined to Trust Politicians?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0178</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_eb5c50c0fac8823b6fc0166c67e2e189" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_eb5c50c0fac8823b6fc0166c67e2e189" type="Folder">2019-0178</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7d09302495dc6b12f9076143bc83b0bc"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper looks at groups of voters that are more interested in politics and trusting towards politicians based on their domicile and educational attainment. Precisely, the paper offers literature overview that argued that interest in politics and political trust are important in determining the levels of political participation and, in the context of a current political movement, the effects of populism. The study uses these two variables - interest and trust - along with recent studies of voting behavior, to determine which groups of voters are likely to be participating in elections and effectively targeted by populist leaders. Regression analysis of the survey data from the European Social Survey offers following interpretation: people from rural areas are less likely to be interested in politics, and less likely to report trust in politicians. There is a positive relationship between the level of educational attainment and interest in politics, as well as between education level and trust in politicians. In conclusion, the paper suggests that when discussing determinants behind voting behavior that favors populism, it is important to consider what makes people more interested in politics and trusting towards politicians. Understanding voters' preferences and what political movements resonate with different voting groups, sparking their interest and trust is key to a successful political movement.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_30a524f0d0cc61f18855b67b717606c6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Karasira, Faustine. <emph render="italic">The effect of Performance contracts on Maternal and Child health services in Rwanda</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0192</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_3d381218d470b8307aaa0dc80dfcacde" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3d381218d470b8307aaa0dc80dfcacde" type="Folder">2019-0192</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d6ee22a5a6551ac43af0f39f47744c7a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper examines the effect of performance contracts (Imihigo) on health services in Rwanda.

The 2015 Nigerian elections does not conform to theories from previous studies. The shift in voter preference between the 2011 and 2015 national elections could be explained by a shift from ethnic attachment towards national identification. Therefore, in this paper we explore the rise of national identification as an explanation to the fall in ethnic attachment. Firstly, we reexamine the role of elections, measured by its proximity and competitiveness on ethnic identification. Secondly, we assess the amplification of national identification by looking at the extent citizens positively perceive their country. Lastly, we evaluate the role of the media in reducing ethnic attachment. We find that the rise in national identification leads to the fall in ethnic identification. The increased access to news from the media improves citizens' political knowledge which stimulates the reduction of ethnic political preference and furthermore ethnic identification. These results contradict previous research and justifies the reasons why Nigerians did not identify to their ethnic identities in periods approaching the 2015 elections.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8e835d24c100f60d5880d9aeeedddf6e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mao, Xinyi. <emph render="italic">Examining the incentives of joining the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0155</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_370927256ac6942db2b1c71facb61cd7" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_370927256ac6942db2b1c71facb61cd7" type="Folder">2019-0155</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d5305d698536418976d5da4c376c40ee"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a multilateral cooperation framework proposed by China in 2013 to further economic, political and cultural exchanges. This paper explores the incentivizing and deterring factors that influence a country's decision to join the Belt and Road Initiative. Economic dependence in the form of reliance on foreign military aid, investments, and trade are found to increase political compliance to dominant countries' preferences. Voting patterns in the United Nations General Assembly are also found to be correlates of previous foreign aid and investments.   Analyzing project-level Chinese foreign direct investment data prior to the BRI's inception, I find that Chinese investments motivate BRI joining when they are heavily concentrated in extractive sectors, but delay BRI joining when the sectors are less extractive, suggesting the importance of sector-specific and project-level approach to studying the BRI. Although not significant, I also find that American air force aid contributes the most to deterring BRI joining. However, regressions run on average data of the years preceding countries' decisions to join the BRI do not find a similar effect.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4f065c08c1006898a4ba7f773dde2186" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mariano, Kirk. <emph render="italic">An Analysis of China's Emerging Influence on the ASEAN Geopolitics</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0133</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_1f54278644d89c1723f983aa1b923d5d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_1f54278644d89c1723f983aa1b923d5d" type="Folder">2019-0133</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d9a1cb46e80675838359b52ec8488295"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Foreign direct investment and foreign aid have always been used by social scientists as influential determinants of other economic factors, or has been influenced by economic and political factors.

In this study, as I tried to analyze the emerging influence of China in the ASEAN geopolitics using the aforementioned variables, I attempted to explore the status quo using the case of China, the ASEAN, and the US. I have found that the influx of Chinese foreign direct investment and foreign aid into the ASEAN member countries are not viable determinants of the ASEAN countries' UN General Assembly voting agreement with China or voting disagreement with the US contrary to the suggested status quo.

Previous scholarship suggests that these jarring events may decrease the popularity of those in power and rally support for leaders advocating for compensation, as opposed to preparedness spending. By examining the past decade of rainfall and voting records at over 8,000 polling stations across Australia, this study investigates how voters from drought affected and unaffected locations have comparatively voted in the Australian federal elections. As the first piece of research that tackles the impacts of drought on elections in Australia, it serves as a case study to understand how the lived experience of climate variability may have political ramifications. Results suggest that those affected by drought tend to support parties advocating for disaster relief rather than parties aiming to enhance water management, particularly in rural areas. This could sway election outcomes towards representatives focused on retrospective drought compensation and, in turn, exacerbate the likelihood of future water shortages in Australia. More broadly, if those at the front-lines of climate impacts prioritize the short term, the onset of climate events could fail to signal democracies towards taking actions necessary to manage future climate disasters.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c22123d05762ff78acf73a88ab562d35" level="file"><did><unittitle>Oh, Sally. <emph render="italic">How Attitudes towards Co-Ethnic Groups Are (Not) Affected by Identity Salience and Information Correction Mechanisms: Evidence from South Korea </emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0162</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_3c2a58f8d3315882946d8577119c9644" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3c2a58f8d3315882946d8577119c9644" type="Folder">2019-0162</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bb8751b0a1ec9189bf10a28bd66bfa83"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Can present bias against co-ethnic groups be changed for the better through reminders of shared identity and corrections of information?

Each peso donated to the activist would be donated to the WWF. Conversely, each peso they kept would be converted into a ticket for the raffle of an iPad. Before donating, however, they were randomly and unknowingly assigned into one of four groups: 1) the main control group, 2) a control group where the activist was described as openly gay, 3) a treatment group where he was described as openly gay and of foreign (white) ancestry, and 4) a treatment group where he was described as openly gay after participants completed a perspective-taking exercise that required them to imagine living with hardships that are common to LGBTQ people in Mexico. Although there was no evidence of implicit homophobic behavior in the sample, it was found that the perspective-taking treatment effectively increased generosity towards the openly gay activist.

I highlight the relationship between the ruling parties in the parliament and state resources allocation in the context of a newly established democracy - Ukraine. I analyze two measures of the sub-national allocations of discretionary grants: at the electoral district and oblast levels. The findings suggest that the effect of coalition on subventions is positive and significant. Additionally, the president's party allocates more subventions than other parties in the parliament, but it does not have an independent effect from being in a coalition. The findings for political business cycles theory are mixed: there is a positive effect in allocations of subventions across all parties, however, the relationship between the coalition and subventions in the election year does not appear to be statistically significant.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_96f1e7c0cf5e2127040df8b31f201ea3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Salazar, Miren Aguirre. <emph render="italic">To Pay or NATO Pay</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0200</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_0e0122cdd2fbdf79f237e139743d2d53" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0e0122cdd2fbdf79f237e139743d2d53" type="Folder">2019-0200</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c31ad1e6fb1ede75eb8537ba8af1d6e7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Previous studies on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation have focused on finding theoretical and qualitative explanations to the imbalanced contributions, lacking a counterfactual for how much countries would dedicate to defence expenditure, should the alliance not exist.

I find that voting preferences for individual countries within the G77 are determined mainly by variation in democracy and human rights, providing new insight both into the dynamics of the UN General Assembly, and into cooperation among developing countries more widely.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4d368ae9530b7847481061fbfb77cd00" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wilson, Abi. <emph render="italic">He Said, She Said: Gender-of-Interviewer Effects in Eastern Congo</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0160</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_120055d537def6854f90ff91518c3aa2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_120055d537def6854f90ff91518c3aa2" type="Folder">2019-0160</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bdb49e7260c55a7fee15e4858d8e3a3f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In survey research, sensitive questions are notoriously vulnerable to biases that lead to inaccurate responses. The question I will seek to answer in this study is: What role does gender play in sensitive interviews in Central Africa? Using data from a randomized survey conducted in the DRC, I ﬁnd that respondents tend to indicate more support for gender equality to female interviewers than male interviewers. However, women are generally less likely to receive responses that report occurrences of gender-based violence than men. Pairing a respondent with an interviewer of the same gender has little to no eﬀect. My results support a causal link between survey responses and interviewer gender. I suggest that cultural context is a key component in understanding gender eﬀects on survey design. My ﬁndings have practical implications for producers and consumers of survey data from Central Africa and underscore the importance of considering cultural context when designing in-person surveys.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_cb22e42907e9fcc51360f6cd990ba0e2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Murr, Amal. <emph render="italic">Women in the Workforce: The Case of the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0159</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_f87b9df9659969b8158eeaf55341db6f" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f87b9df9659969b8158eeaf55341db6f" type="Folder">2020-0159</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b08a8369710e69ac7030fab9e658ddd0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>A common global trend that is often studied around the world is the disparity between high female tertiary education rates and low female workforce participation. Although many scholars in the field have studied these effects globally, none have studied them in the context of the UAE. Interestingly enough, the effects of high education and lower workforce participation are more prominent in the UAE since most of the female population in the UAE is highly educated. Nevertheless, this large population of educated women is not represented in the workforce, which raises many questions; Why are Emirati women acquiring a higher education if they do not plan to enter the workforce? More importantly, what are the potential explanations for such a high education rate, yet an extremely low workforce participation rate? To answer these questions, this study will entertain three potential explanations derived from previous literature based outside the region including; Family/Culture, Resources, and Discrimination. Through the scope of these explanations, this study aims to contribute to the scarce literature on such topics in the UAE and the greater Gulf region.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

As part of this initiative, each village selected a community animal health worker, who is responsible for monitoring and maintaining animal health. I test three hypotheses: 1) Ethnic diversity is negatively correlated with the performance of the community workers, 2) More ethnic diversity leads to less suitable community workers getting selected, 3) More ethnic diversity leads to lower social capital. I use two measures for ethnic diversity – ethnolinguistic fractionalization (ELF) and ethnic polarization, as the independent variables. I run OLS regression with chiefdom fixed effects and include controls for various characteristics of the community and the worker. The results for both ELF and ethnic polarization are the same: there is not sufficient evidence for any of the three hypotheses, suggesting ethnic diversity does not have an impact on public goods providers.</p><p>Author contributed keywords:

On the one hand, exposure to migrants might lead to positive attitudes as misconceptions are dispelled; on the other, attitudes might become negative due to increased competition for limited resources. This study explores whether Mexican respondents' attitudes are affected by their exposure to migrant flows coming from Central America and heading to the United States. I combine spatial data on migrant routes with 11,006 geo-referenced biennial survey responses from 2006 to 2016 to investigate how exposure to migrant flows affects public opinion towards them. I find that Mexican citizens' exposure to Central American migrant flows through proximity to migrant routes has no effect on their perceptions towards these groups. I also demonstrate that the result is robust to alternative specifications and codings. This study contributes to the literature by examining the effect of exposure on perceptions towards migrants in a Mexican context and proposing an alternative explanation for understanding inter-group relationships apart from the social contact and group threat theories.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Moreover, Latvia has been historically divided between territories under the influence of the Lutheran church and territories under the influence of the Catholic church. In addition, due to its imperial legacies, historic variation in ethnic homogeneity can be observed in Latvia. These divisions and variations have brought about divergence in economic development, institutions, as well as culture. In this paper I find that differences in income and unemployment have originated from the different historic religious influences, as well as from differences in historic homogeneity. I also find that imperial legacies of both the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Russian Empire can account for worse contemporary economic outcomes. Lastly, I find that historic homogeneity accounts for higher voter turnout and better implementation of the rule of law in Latvia nowadays.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

In line with the resource curse literature, I argue that increases in oil revenues are associated with more corruption, thereby increasing corruption levels across countries. In this paper I show that this relationship holds true even after controlling for GDP per Capita, democracy level, Ethnolinguistic Fractionalization, civil war, among others. I study the possible pathways of this relationship by analyzing the cross-country effects of oil revenues on five different measures of corruption. I further test this relationship through an instrumental variable approach using positive oil price spikes (shocks) as an instrument for oil revenues. The relationship also holds using this approach. The theory and empirical results presented in this paper offer clues for policy makers and the public as to where do the revenues of an extremely high-rent activity go.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

After failure to protect civilians both in Somalia and cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo, peacekeeping operations have faced strong criticism. In this paper, I study the extent to which the United Nations strategically selects to protect civilians in relation to actors of one-sided violence and exogenous factors. Through a simple game-theoretical exploration using strategic statistical analysis, I examine the sub-national deployment decision of United Nations' peacekeeping troops within nine African countries at a monthly rate from 2000 to 2011. Using a novel monthly geo-referenced dataset by Cil, Fjelde, Hultman and Nilsson (2019), I examine how exogenous factors affect the UN's deployment decision to areas seeing an onset of one-sided violence towards civilians. I show that the United Nations is less likely to move troops to mountainous and densely populated areas seeing one-sided violence, as well as to areas with peacekeepers in close proximity. Further, I show that the United Nations is more likely to deploy troops to areas seeing one-sided violence committed by weak rebel groups.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

It assesses the role of the regional threats in incentivizing the leaders of the sheikhdoms comprising the Trucial States to unite into one country. The method this project utilizes is the study of the socio-political history of the UAE between 1820 and 1971. The events that took place in this period are analyzed using canonical texts in political theory on political development, state security, and federalism. Through analyzing the historical events and the resultant political arrangements in the UAE, the paper shows that federalism was the system that could unite the Trucial States and build state capacity while respecting the traditional political institutions of the Trucial States. The paper concludes that motivated by the regional threats, the Trucial States united under the auspices of federalism because the latter allowed for building state capacity while respecting the traditional political institutions of the Emirati people.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

The results suggest that Palestinians living in close proximity to settlements are more likely to express negative attitudes towards settlers than those living further away.

This paper argues that the development and use of LAWS pose two corollary threats to liberal democracies. First, LAWS are near impossible to regulate due to their confidential and complex algorithms that drive them. Second, the development of weapons that require minimal manpower presents a perilous opportunity for the means of violence, and consequently power, to concentrate in the hands of a few.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Using a cross-classification variable comprised of sexual attraction, relationships and identity, this study examines the effects of individual-level and environmental-level indicators of school integration, religious fundamentalism, experience of prejudice, exposure to violence, and school sanctions. Using multinomial regression analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health, this study finds that unsupportive environments limit sexual fluidity and sexuality outcomes, particularly in female respondents, while there is also some indication that more supportive environments engender greater sexual diversity. Given the considerable psychological consequences of repressing one's sexuality, the findings of this study encourage policy interventions at the high-school level to foster greater education and inclusivity to overcome the additive stresses that sexual minority youth face, while encouraging further research into the dynamics of contemporary high schools.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Minorities</subject><subject source="local">Queer</subject><subject source="local">LGBT</subject><subject source="lcsh">Identity</subject><subject source="lcsh">Homosexuality</subject><subject source="lcsh">Stigma (Social psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Schools/Education</subject><subject source="lcsh">Sexuality</subject><subject source="lcsh">Adolescents</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref86_f3y" level="file"><did><unittitle>Borgeson, Jade Elizabeth. <emph render="italic">Volunteerism and Divergent Forms of Giving in the Abu Dhabi Community</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0078</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="142" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">142</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_52e047612a220717f1845e9da0cad0ee" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_52e047612a220717f1845e9da0cad0ee" type="Folder">2014-0078</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_27d94b1aa4a6c5e906bfc4cece8387dd"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: In the last 25 years (Ali, 1986), the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, as a subsidiary of the greater United Arab Emirates, has experienced a massive influx of immigration that has dramatically impacted the demographics and nature of the resident community in the capital.

But it is not clear that these are the motives of the less powerful. Our study considers the conflict of gay marriage in the United States. Through a content analysis of texts of representatives of higher-power, anti-gay marriage authors and lower-power, pro-gay marriage authors, we show that while higher power groups in a conflict consistently characterize the lower power group as trying to dominate, no such evidence can be found in the writings and speeches of low-power groups. Instead, lower-power groups use language of resisting domination by demanding equal treatment, respect and dignity. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and political implications of these findings as well as possibilities for future research.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Antidominance</subject><subject source="lcsh">Dominance (Psychology)</subject><subject source="local">Social dominance theory</subject><subject source="lcsh">Power (Psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Conflict</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref106_3f6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gancheva, Darina Nevelinova. <emph render="italic">Programmatic and Voting Cohesion of European Political Groups in the 7th European Parliament</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0072</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="162" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">162</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_f389e1d4f1eb712574d11e7f6d51bed1" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f389e1d4f1eb712574d11e7f6d51bed1" type="Folder">2014-0072</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_75ff3dc29f72a9f9db38371e311f1a37"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: This study diagnoses whether European parties fulfill their function as the primary mechanism for European representation and delegation. The EU party system functions at two levels: national and supranational. At the European elections, EU citizens vote for a national party of their choice. After the elections, the national parties that have received enough votes enter the EP and join one of the transnational European political groups ("EP factions"). These groups are conglomerates of different national parties and form coalitions based on – what they claim to be – a shared ideology. This study examines 1) whether the EP factions are programmatically cohesive, and 2) whether programmatic cohesion, rather than intra-faction pressure, is what explains the high voting cohesion rates of EP factions. Discriminant analysis based on the programmatic profiles of national parties suggests that EP factions are programmatically cohesive units. Variation in the voting agreement rates, however, is mostly due to intra-faction pressure, more prominent in the mainstream pro-EU factions. The programmatic cohesion and voting efficacy of EP factions prove that EP elections and the legislative process are becoming increasingly European and decreasingly national.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Political parties</subject><subject source="lcsh">Political manifestoes</subject><subject source="lcsh">Voting</subject><subject source="lcsh">Elections</subject><subject source="lcsh">European Union</subject><subject source="lcsh">European Parliament</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref96_4gr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gonullu, Damla. <emph render="italic">The Role of Race in Mental Health: A Study on the Children of Cuban Immigrants in Florida</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0069</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="152" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">152</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_100181e205bb5430cba4783d2a5271d2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_100181e205bb5430cba4783d2a5271d2" type="Folder">2014-0069</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5c66bffc7247453e03aa10e5dac0f743"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: The racial disparities in mental health are well documented, and there are many studies examining the link between race and mental health. In this paper, I model this relationship by comparing the differences in the depression index scores of Cuban children with differing races and then examining two pathways (discrimination and acculturation) that may contribute to the difference in scores of White and Black/Multiracial Cuban immigrant children to the US. Results indicate that this model provides support for the hypothesis that there is a statistically significant difference in the average depression index scores of White and Black/Multiracial Cuban children. However, this model does not provide support for the two pathways that may contribute to those differences. This study provides a unique lens with which to explore the relationship between race and mental health. Unlike other studies of its kind, it focuses on self-reported discrimination, combines racial discrimination with acculturation, and uses quantitative analysis to better understand this relationship within a highly specific immigrant group, Cuban immigrants.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Racism</subject><subject source="lcsh">Discrimination</subject><subject source="lcsh">Race</subject><geogname source="lcsh">United States of America</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Immigrants</subject><subject source="lcsh">Cubans</subject><subject source="lcsh">Depression, Mental</subject><subject source="lcsh">Acculturation</subject><subject source="lcsh">Health</subject><subject source="lcsh">Mental health</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref98_sfh" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mehra, Abhishek. <emph render="italic">On Fertility, the Preference for Sons and Child Mortality in India</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0062</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="154" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">154</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_1a6ef9883f2202dee1a1cacea5daa5eb" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_1a6ef9883f2202dee1a1cacea5daa5eb" type="Folder">2014-0062</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_629f1e28edbfcc0521ef68086073fc46"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: The social development theory of demographic transition holds that demographic trends, especially the level of fertility, reflect the degree to which political and economic institutions reflect social justice (Ratcliffe, 1978). The falling fertility rates in India in the last few decades are thought to reflect the success of the processes and policies with the potential to empower women. Au contraire, similar amount of literature exists that argues otherwise - that falls in fertility are believed to be occurring independent of social development. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the changing gender differential in child mortality (which is a reflection of either an intensification or a reduction in the effect of son preference), when there is a fall in fertility. This question is analyzed using two waves of NFHS data to build on the work of Basu (1999) and Gupta and Bhat (1997). I find that in states that were already characterized by a preference for sons, a fall in fertility at a relatively faster pace saw the gender differential in child mortality increase significantly, indicating an intensification of existing son preference at lower parities. This paper ends with policy suggestions.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Social development</subject><subject source="lcsh">Women</subject><subject source="lcsh">Demography</subject><subject source="lcsh">Fertility</subject><subject source="lcsh">Child mortality</subject><subject source="lcsh">Gender</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref85_i2o" level="file"><did><unittitle>Radler, Meike Sydney. <emph render="italic">The social mobility processes of second-generation</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0084</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="141" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">141</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_a7d5060783556de187d12d424d1123f5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a7d5060783556de187d12d424d1123f5" type="Folder">2014-0084</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_fe74a915b89d1f269e78f3f1dfb3f898"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: Based on data from semi-structured interviews, this study investigates the social mobility strategies employed by upwardly mobile German-Turkish women living in Berlin. Using educational attainment and labour market achievement as objective indicators of upward mobility, the subjects fit into three categories of social mobility trajectories. Important processes for upward mobility are identified within these categories, using the framework of Bourdieu's theory of capital. In some cases, the domestic transmission of cultural capital is essential for upward mobility, while in others it is a context-specific resource for effective decision-making. Moreover, an expansion of social capital to extend beyond isolated ethnic communities is decisive for all subjects; either for its conversion into necessary cultural capital or through the avoidance of some of the negative effects of social capital on women in certain tightly-bound ethnic communities. While the mobilisation of ethnicity is useful for the upward mobility of a subgroup of German-Turkish women, it is a limitation for others. Finally, regardless of social mobility trajectory categorization, subjects are unified by their lack of symbolic capital in mainstream German society. The strategies they employ to counter this are found to be more assertive and focused on Germany than those employed by the previous generation.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Germans</subject><subject source="lcsh">Turks</subject><subject source="lcsh">Social mobility</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Berlin, Germany</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Women</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Germany</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Social capital (Sociology)</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref90_tcx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Taylor, Thomas Llewellyn Mussared. <emph render="italic">"This is a Bangla Place": Identity Claims to Public Space in Downtown Abu Dhabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2014-0097</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="146" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">146</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2014/2014">2014</unitdate><container id="aspace_ff63041683c4185c43899d0fa4807603" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_ff63041683c4185c43899d0fa4807603" type="Folder">2014-0097</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_418982c58918446cfb2a42915a7c313a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy <lb/>Abstract: There is a square in downtown Abu Dhabi that is known to Bangladeshis the city over as khajur tola.

By analyzing Facebook comments published throughout the year 2014, I ask how PEGIDA influenced a change in the migration discourse on Facebook in Germany. I find, that the rise of PEGIDA in December 2014 encouraged a shift in the migration discourse on Facebook. It reoriented the debate from discussing immigration to rejecting right wing nationalist ideology. As PEGIDA supporters amplified their presence on Facebook, commenters concerned with the extremist discourse overshadowed those in support of immigration. Immigrants themselves were not the primary topic of discussion in the migration discourse in December.<lb/>This is an example of discursive deflection, as the silence regarding immigrants resulted from individuals becoming focused on nationalist stances on migration. The discursive deflection in this research is not unique to Facebook users in Germany. It emerged across social circles and mediums, as individuals turned to defend political correctness amidst a rising nationalist discourse. Facebook comments nonetheless provide an insightful window into discursive deflection, because they make visible a multitude of private opinions, which would not otherwise become public knowledge.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="local">Discursive deflection</subject><subject source="lcsh">Right-wing extremists</subject><subject source="lcsh">Social media</subject><subject source="lcsh">Facebook (Electronic resource)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Immigration</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Germany</geogname><subject source="lcsh">International migration</subject><subject source="local">Migration</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref290_565" level="file"><did><unittitle>Naslund, Cambria Marjorie Melanie. <emph render="italic">A Worthy Cause?: How Social Meanings of Illness Impact the Success of Medical Crowdfunding</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0047</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3367" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3367</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_4018fa0ae3bc56540e2f1ea640a93aa9" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_4018fa0ae3bc56540e2f1ea640a93aa9" type="Folder">2015-0047</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_e9ed28c2675a9aacff0941f3c108b60d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy<lb/>Abstract: In the past decade, crowdfunding has emerged as an alternative point of access to economic resources. The crowdfunding of medical bills is of particular interest given rising healthcare costs, but has received little attention in research on the dynamics of crowdfunding. As the general public evaluates which cases are worthy of their donations, it becomes increasingly important to understand the factors accounting for differences in donation behavior. One factor specific to this type of crowdfunding is represented by the categories of illness that individuals cite in their requests for donations. Diagnostic categories are both shaped by and shape social meanings and valuations of illness and the ill. Using a dataset of over 40,000 medical fundraising campaigns from the crowdfunding platform, GoFundMe, this research finds that existing theories of social meanings and value rankings of illnesses predict differences in financial support in the context of medical crowdfunding. The implications of these findings are discussed and directions for future research are proposed.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Stigma (Social psychology)</subject><subject source="lcsh">Fundraising</subject><subject source="lcsh">Illness</subject><subject source="lcsh">Medical sociology</subject><subject source="lcsh">Crowdfunding</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref294_884" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pasternac, Oleg. <emph render="italic">Post-Soviet Identity in the "Russian" Restaurants of Abu Dhabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0053</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3369" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3369</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_0f1ef8feaf7a0b594dfd0842711dfb85" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0f1ef8feaf7a0b594dfd0842711dfb85" type="Folder">2015-0053</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2b96c25fe3ad3bdff44635bf92c4b54d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy<lb/>Abstract: This thesis explores the complexness of identity of the post-Soviet nations in the restarurants of Abu Dhabi, combining interviews of the employees with participant observations to study the presence and strength of the Soviet legacy in the environments of the restaurants.

Using data collected from interviews with Emirati entrepreneurs, as well as representatives of organizations that promote entrepreneurship in the UAE, I investigate the different rationales behind entrepreneurial activity of Emirati entrepreneurs in tandem with the social, cultural, and institutional dimensions of the entrepreneurial context of the UAE. The findings reveal that most Emirati entrepreneurs pursue entrepreneurship with intrinsic motivations of following their passions, proving themselves through a personal challenge, and most commonly, making a social or cultural contribution to the UAE and to the larger Arab world. I conclude that specific aspects of the entrepreneurial context of the UAE give rise to a purposeful and value-focused nature of entrepreneurship, where economic motives are absent or secondary. The study contributes to the literature in economic sociology that finds entrepreneurial activity to be socially embedded, and guided by factors other than economic self-interest.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Economic sociology</subject><geogname source="lcsh">United Arab Emirates</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Entrepreneurship</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref288_m42" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sotoudeh, Ramina. <emph render="italic">"A Match Made in Heaven": Spousal Selection Among Iranians</emph></unittitle><unitid>2015-0055</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="3366" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">3366</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2015/2015">2015</unitdate><container id="aspace_7c09c31da9279ba2fad281c362d49988" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_7c09c31da9279ba2fad281c362d49988" type="Folder">2015-0055</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ae23db67546eec5bf0c58b546aca6e7f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Major: Social Research and Public Policy<lb/>Abstract: Romantic love, especially in the context of marriage, has been the topic of much attention and debate in recent academic and non-academic discussions. The debate however is often centered on the necessary societal and cultural conditions for producing romantic love in marriage. This paper aims to take a different perspective on the interaction of culture and romantic love. Instead of looking at culture as a direct cause of the role, structure and view of love in marriage among Iranians, this paper follows more contemporary views of culture as heterogeneous and context-specific rather than a singular and uniform driving force of all action.  Using Latent Class Analysis, I uncover classes of people who have different constellations of preferences for selecting their spouse. This analysis reveals that love can be simultaneously associated with other values, which prima facie appear contradictory. This paper finds that love can have different meanings to different people depending on the constellation of other mate selection criteria with which it is chosen and associated; and therefore, that coherence is contextually established.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Culture</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Iran</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Spouses</subject><subject source="lcsh">Love</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref455_6f8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cricco, Nino. <emph render="italic">Is Getting Pregnant the Worst?

The aim of this study is to understand the stigma associated with mental illness in the UAE using 12 semi-structured interviews, with youth ranging from the age of 18-26. The data proves that stigma stems from the generational difference between the mentalities of the youth and their parents. The first difference is illustrated through their different understanding of the relationship between faith and mental illness, and the second difference is demonstrated through the legitimacy and illegitimacy of mental illness. The youth exhibited complex relationships between faith and mental illness whereas older generations were portrayed to have a straightforward understanding, believing that there is a causal relationship between faith and mental health. Moreover the youth advocated for the legitimacy of mental illness through the use of medical intervention. On the other hand, they believed their parents would prefer religious intervention instead of medical intervention because they did not believe in the legitimacy of mental illnesses. The youths understanding of their parents perceptions on mental illnesses influence their own.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_dbd764fe7e9a3572cd6b87a0f1c154b9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Almehrzi, Shereena Salem. <emph render="italic">The Case of Emirati Parents: Making Sense of Child Abuse and Children's Rights</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0144</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_97bd67a23147bf8fe8f128c15c8db66c" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_97bd67a23147bf8fe8f128c15c8db66c" type="Folder">2018-0144</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_eace66a1625cd141085463a6771c0db6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper is an attempt to unravel how Emirati parents come to understand children's rights, specifically child abuse, and how that relates to their practices of parenting and discipline. Through semi-structured interviews, this paper taps into the lives of Emirati parents, in light of the introduction of Wadeema's Law and its supporting policies. To examine the case of Emirati parents, the frameworks of sense making and the critiques of human rights are used to analyze parents' responses. Parents take part in dynamic negotiations to reconcile ideas of discipline and parenting. They attempt to raise confident, well-mannered and socially integrated children, under conditions that are more challenging from the ones in which they were raised. Parents understand children's rights as merely providing the children with a "good life". In an ever-changing society, the parents try to uphold the ways in which parenting is done, by solving problems within the family and attempting to maintain the power dynamic.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_db8f84692cd37a70a8dd4e375ffed262" level="file"><did><unittitle>AlMemari, Maitha. <emph render="italic">Emirati Youths' Academic Decision-Making</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0120</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_22dd000d4c4ce1abbbaa87611b211f80" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_22dd000d4c4ce1abbbaa87611b211f80" type="Folder">2018-0120</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9f34d66ef10bb5c48d6429dea1689d01"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study explores how Emirati youth make decisions about higher education, what are the factors that influence them and what is their decision-making process.

What happens when the wife's employment upsets the "normal" or "traditional" household arrangement? While the UAE can be characterized by a traditional gender ideology, it is also a modernizing country and the composition of the workforce is changing. Through in-depth interviews of employees at the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department, the Abu Dhabi Judicial Academy and the Family Guidance Division, I will explore how four factors, collectively, undermine the ideal type of marriage within Emirati couples. The aim of this research is not necessarily a depiction of how many Emirati divorces fell victim to these factors, but how this process works. Knowing this reveals the implications of the traditional and the modernizing self living together, displaying the potential issues that could arise when women's work becomes an issue in a marriage, how the "traditional" household arrangement still stands strong with some Emirati families, and how conclusions of Western literature can be generalizable to the Arab-Muslim world, particularly the UAE, filling a potential gap in current literature.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_321d8e32808048dfc323b2fb360920fa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dahab, Zaid Abu. <emph render="italic">Dokha Diffusion Outside the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0120</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_7da50df68cc61d2bd7fce9f0895b9222" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_7da50df68cc61d2bd7fce9f0895b9222" type="Folder">2018-0120</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_113c0482d5bdf9c083278848ed17c84a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This study explores how Emirati youth make decisions about higher education, what are the factors that influence them and what is their decision-making process.

As the result of large-scale international migration, over 300,000 minor refugees currently attend public schools across Germany's 16 federal states. Research has demonstrated the benefits of refugees' medium- to long-term integration into the workforce, which reduces welfare costs, increases government revenue, and fosters social integration. As many refugee students currently lack linguistic and employability skills, vocational schools, and teachers face increasing challenges of addressing the unique needs of refugee students adequately.  Combining field work, interviews, and survey data, I analyse the situation of refugees at vocational schools from the perspective of teachers. Assessing teacher quality through the concept of teacher self-efficacy, my research is guided by the empirical research question "What factors influence teachers' stress, motivation, and self-efficacy working with refugees at German vocational school?"

The disparity in wealth reflects the socioeconomic implications of immigration in the U.S., especially on the American economy. The second generation is also a linguistically rich population, of which most speak a mother-tongue language in addition to having native fluency in English. The purpose of the study was to examine whether bilingualism of second-generation immigrants has a positive effect on their socioeconomic outcomes. The study uses online cross-sectional survey responses from self-identified second-generation immigrants in the U.S. (n=3215). The linear regression analysis shows that bilingual second-generation immigrants have higher earnings relative to their English monolingual counterparts; children of Chinese immigrants outperform their second-generation peers; there is no effect of signaling bilingualism in the resume, and all levels of bilingualism improve occupational status. Thus, I conclude that investment in bilingualism for second-generation immigrants will be beneficial for American economy and society.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bd176861f78906e7b6cd29fe64c4ca9d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kheetan, Daniah. <emph render="italic">Gender Based Violence in Jordan: Legal and Social Protection for Women Against Sexual Assault</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0121</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_5d0c33ef7793da9523d208010e8a199b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_5d0c33ef7793da9523d208010e8a199b" type="Folder">2018-0121</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_739fee6fd929e1e2bc0caa77f18253ac"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Jordan successfully revoked Article 308 of its Penal Code, which had previously allowed impunity to rapists if they married their victims. The marry-your-rapist-laws are manifestations of institutionalized Gender Based Discrimination (GBD), and have contributed to systematic marginalization and Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual Violence (SV) against women. These laws have historically been controversial, and the revocation is seemingly positive. However the social controversy around revocation shows that revocation failed to address the social and cultural nuances. Thus, to provide legal and social protection for women against Gender Based and Sexual Violence, this capstone argues that a sociological understating of these laws and women's experience must precede legal change. Thus, this capstone constructs and deploys a sociological framework of analysis on qualitative sociological data from a series of interviews conducted with stakeholders in Jordan. The paper found that the policy an social environment around women's issues are constructed and affected by four factors: Society and Culture, Economic History, Political History, and Distinct Contextual Factor, Current Political Climate for Jordan. The Capstone concludes with policy recommendations that primarily address the enhancement of women's legal and social protection against SV, and on a larger extent, end GBD and GBV in Jordan.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_2fd4851a611cbcb0cdbf1a5b854d4471" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kohut, Roman. <emph render="italic">One Thousand Kilometers of Difference: A Set of Recommendations for the Ministry of Education of Ukraine on Integration of IDP Youth into Lviv, Ukraine</emph>

The data collected from a sample of 19 local and IDP secondary school and university students through focus groups and questionnaires suggests that, while secondary schools and higher academic institutions are generally accessible to IDP youth, the availability of financial aid in universities remains paramount in allowing them to pursue their academic interests. The process of receiving financial aid should be streamlined regardless of whether the university reports primarily to the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Culture. Given that IDPs are mainly clustered in schools with Russian language of instruction, further social studies should be conducted to assess and conceptualize the presence of segregated education in the city. There also is an urgent and continuously growing need for professional academic advising and career development services in secondary schools and universities in Ukraine that are not provided in reality despite the already existing decrees. Furthermore, the urgent need for an intercultural education and cultural engagement program in the city's secondary schools and universities is apparent.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_bc95b3ebb379c9a0709f0872cdad87e8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ladhani, Adam. <emph render="italic">Workers or Citizens: An Analysis of US and Canadian High-Skilled Temporary Migration Laws and Debates</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0168</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_7623251f7eebfdef96cedc580ab8ac33" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_7623251f7eebfdef96cedc580ab8ac33" type="Folder">2018-0168</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_c2103ff699757e3a3084b50e9c6b858c"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>My capstone project focuses on high-skilled temporary foreign worker programs in the U.S. and Canada.

Three first-year student residence buildings were allocated to a Control Group (N=155), Group A (N=103), and Group B (N=58). Each building's general waste, paper/cardboard recycling, and plastic/can recycling was weighed and rated (on quality of separation) each day by the cleaning staff for a 5-week baseline period and 5-week post-treatment period. Each apartment within Group A and B received labeled paper/cardboard and plastic/can recycling bins [infrastructure alteration] during a one-week treatment period. Additionally, Group B received weekly feedback pamphlets on their recycling rates, quality, and tips for improvement [feedback treatment] throughout the post-treatment measurements. After both treatments, a survey was conducted on all groups to measure recycling knowledge, as well as treatment saturation, spillover, and student opinions on interventions. Data shows promising evidence that infrastructure alteration leads to improved recycling behavior and knowledge, while the feedback treatment had marginal to no observed effect on recycling improvement. This paper ends with policy recommendations for NYUAD.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8b67ffc745af2d1827d884c543272bf7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Okatch, Claire Louise. <emph render="italic">I will work where I want: Sex Desegregation in the Tour Guide Industry in Zanzibar</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0126</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_083e74114fe9aa33d253063cef469c7d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_083e74114fe9aa33d253063cef469c7d" type="Folder">2018-0126</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9e5ec928e115044d8f7d92c51d8e5b4b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This paper explores the gendered experiences of tour guides in Zanzibar. I specifically focus on how gender norms affect both entrance into the profession and how the tour guides conduct themselves within the field. The analysis draws on 20 interviews with tour guides around Stone Town, Zanzibar. Based on this data, I argue that due to the function of tour guiding as a performance of cultural authenticity, female tour guides occupy a position of contradiction as both the challenger and performer of authentic culture.   The paper examines this contradiction by discussing the ways in which tour guiding is socially constructed as a male profession. Additionally, it explores the barriers that maintain these gender norms and the tools women use to break these barriers while maintaining authenticity. I conclude that the women who become tour guides show an understanding of both gender norms and market dynamics which they manipulate in order to gain entrance into the profession.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_3b0c3ade48c1f0f35b6d5efeb0f3aa8e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Taylor, Hannah. <emph render="italic">The Massachusetts Opioid Epidemic: Course and Coverage</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0157</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_87f150fde02feee9dca1e8c47c722768" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_87f150fde02feee9dca1e8c47c722768" type="Folder">2018-0157</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b9ecf9b2db16e5b4681f7830332de94a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The United States is currently in the grips of the worst drug epidemic the country has ever seen, the opioid epidemic, and Massachusetts is one of the states that is hardest hit. As of 2016, approximately 5 people died a day from opioid overdose in Massachusetts (Bebinger, 2016). Much of the existing literature on the opioid epidemic focuses on the link between overprescription of opioid painkillers and addiction which eventually leads to overdose and death. Information about what populations are hit worse in terms of race, socioeconomic status and lifestyle factors is also increasingly documented. This research aims to add to the existing body of literature surrounding the opiate epidemic by examining town-level correlates of the opioid epidemic in Massachusetts. As town-level correlates are predictive of both the intensity of the epidemic and representative of community resources in fighting the epidemic, understanding them merits increased attention. Key findings include the correlation between town characteristics of low income, low educational attainment, low proportion of white people, and high political conservatism with high overdose death rates. The second paper employs text analysis to illuminate how the epidemic enters public consciousness, and what community-level characteristics shape newspaper coverage.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ca457664a9b4773672752a7dbb0be60b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Tehputri, Carrisa. <emph render="italic">The Outsiders' Grief: Behind the Radicalization of British Muslims</emph></unittitle><unitid>2018-0159</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2018/2018">2018</unitdate><container id="aspace_2841933a4931b2dec71943c3e16d69f3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_2841933a4931b2dec71943c3e16d69f3" type="Folder">2018-0159</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_889b43bfc8f3ff05acddb10d346ab0d8"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This project explores narratives of second- to third-generation British Muslims who are often discriminated for their identity and the reason why the discrimination are experienced by many yet only enhances extremist ideology among a minority. The narratives of de- radicalized and non-radicalized interviewees are compared in order to examine the role of multiple outlets utilized by non-radicalized interviewees to evade extremist ideology. The interviews reveal that the availability of outlets to nurture multiple components of one's identity is effective in preventing discriminated individuals from joining extremist groups - a notion that policy discourses often misses. On the other hand, those who identify strongly with only a single component of their identity tend to act violently when it is 'under attack'. With the findings from 52 hours of interview, this study aims to augment existing studies on identity and counterterrorism, as well as to suggest new directions for related research.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_771e0869dfdb9b5c746c562091f36282" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ahmad, Lama. <emph render="italic">The Case of Internet Research Agency Twitter Propaganda in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0190</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_50123921af9ac65d5276f0e8f1a03677" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_50123921af9ac65d5276f0e8f1a03677" type="Folder">2019-0190</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d0bdbac6bdcabfd52ee527d87f91cff9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The purpose of this study is to shed light on the features of tweets that drove Americans to engage with propaganda disseminated by the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) on Twitter around the time of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and to understand the differences between the content of originally authored versus retweeted IRA propaganda tweets. This study defines engagement in terms of the number of retweets and likes that tweets receive. Using comparisons of specific tweet features such as URLs, hashtags, tweet length, sentiment, and language, this study finds that while there are subtle but not substantively significant differences in engagement for some features, overall engagement with the tweets in the dataset is low and more evidence is needed to understand tweet features as drivers of engagement.

The women who participated in the research varied in age, ranging from elderlies (over the age of sixty) to youth (twenty-year-olds), demonstrating the change in perceptions over the span of generations. The topics that will be discussed are kinship as related to lineage and family name, social interactions involving gatherings and social media, systems of beliefs such as religion and tradition, and generational differences in mentalities. The rapid transformation that the country underwent including the contact with people from diverse backgrounds since the 1960s lead to a shift in the mentalities of the Emirati people. All of which affected the criteria with which women in society based their conceptualization of one another's reputation as well as their own. Ultimately, this paper aims to address the shortcomings in the existing field of research by deconstructing the concept of 'reputation' in Emirati society.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ee069cdb02015a3e71dfa2a1e77cdcd1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Al Gergawi, Amal. <emph render="italic">The Effect of Stressors on the Mental Health of Displaced and Non-Displaced Children and Adolescents in Niger</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0193</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_78d2953f186974fb589fd6725ab80bd0" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_78d2953f186974fb589fd6725ab80bd0" type="Folder">2019-0193</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5653c05fbee5e6d89f69260dfe2c5f10"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Reflected in the student demographic, the West-African landlocked nation hosts a growing forcibly displaced community composed of refugees, returnees, and IDPs residing alongside civilians. Identifying the effect of stress-inducing factors or "stressors" on displaced children and adolescents in relation to their non-displaced peers can shed light on how Niger can strategically address mental health symptoms in a geopolitically sensitive region. This study analyses the baseline results of a Global TIES for Children dataset collected in the 2016-2017 academic year on 1,876 students dispersed across thirty "Education in Emergency: Evidence for Action"schools located in the Maine-Soroa and Diffa regions. Specifically, the study examines the effects of five stressors –hunger, community safety, age appropriateness, future mobility, and French literacy– on student mental health operationalized through the following instruments: the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Response to Stress Questionnaire-Stress Levels, the Response to Stress Questionnaire-Involuntary Engagement, and the Preschool Self-Regulation Assessment. The main findings of this study suggest that community safety and French literacy significantly affect the mental health of displaced and non-displaced children and adolescents, implying that displaced students do not differ from their non-displaced counterparts. These results contribute to expanding the frontiers of literature on mental health stressors and displaced youth in the Global South.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_30571cbebd27cbc33f5a584dde029b11" level="file"><did><unittitle>Alshimmari, Sara Abdulla Satam Altraibeel. <emph render="italic">Perspectives on Marriage and Gender Roles Through the Lens of Youth from Abu Dhabi</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0176</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_652f18a8de57b5e55c336d3d3e25c1b2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_652f18a8de57b5e55c336d3d3e25c1b2" type="Folder">2019-0176</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_60c048b302415bddf51eac9cf9c40e5e"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This research project examines youths' perceptions on marriage and marriage roles.

Using data from Global TIES for Children's 3EA project, "Education in Emergencies: Evidence for Action (3EA)", the study investigates the relationship between religion and academic outcomes of primary school students in Sierra Leone. Secondary data analysis shows a very low significant correlation between being Muslim and one's academic achievement and finds no correlation between child annual percent attendance and being Muslim. However, the joint role of religion and gender with regard to student outcomes proves to be significant when looking at the comparative beta values among the religion-gender groups in the regression analysis. I find that being both female and Muslim yields higher academic achievement than any other group in the study. The study also finds a significant positive association between student attendance and academic outcomes but does not succeed in manifesting a mediating effect of attendance. Overall, this study aims to highlight the importance of understanding and evaluating the factors that influence schooling outcomes in conflict-affected and low-income countries like Sierra Leone.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c9ac4515438d71c088953b6b443abdd9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Banga, Gigs. <emph render="italic">The Young Expat: The Development of Expatriate Adolescence in the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0199</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_d1b6bc911a2accfe7c7d6209e4b4bc1b" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d1b6bc911a2accfe7c7d6209e4b4bc1b" type="Folder">2019-0199</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ea528f3128adca844f098a033237a909"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The stories of young expatriates, those who emigrate with their families to the U.A.E. is a complex one. However, it is narrative often assumed or set-aside. This qualitative research project hopes to provide integral insight by understanding the nuances in the individual stories of young foreign nationals living in the U.A.E. The paper investigates and explores whether, how, and to what extent the intersection of an expatriate way of living – contained within expectations about what it means to a 'good' expat – conflicts with a restrictive nature of adolescent development. The social phenomenon is called Expatriate Adolescence. The process involves foreign teenagers toiling with the central question of how they come to navigate their new home in Abu Dhabi - be it social, familial or cultural, what unique challenges does this populace encounter? Given the changing ethnoscape of this country, there is much variance in the degree to which the young expatriates experience a 'curated' adolescent life in the U.A.E. Hence, the studying of this population is vital in filling a lacuna in the scholarship on Gulf migration, as well as in adolescent development theory.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_039c7f342da7e58602f32dac82de1fe3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Booth, Sara. <emph render="italic">Female Migration, Adaptation, and Child Health in Urban India: Evidence from NFHS-3</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0157</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e053f7ece2a4d56f72029fffacbc41af" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e053f7ece2a4d56f72029fffacbc41af" type="Folder">2019-0157</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6e9bad2d2576434ce42b944f8bb51d08"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effect of female rural-urban migration on child health outcomes in urban India, within the framework of the disruption and adaptation theory of migration. Drawing on data from the third wave of the National Family and Health Survey, I compare socioeconomic factors and child health outcomes among rural-urban migrants, urban non-migrants, and rural non-migrants. I find no direct support for the hypothesis that children of rural-urban migrants are worse off in terms of health. Instead, my findings suggest that small differences in child health are explained by observed differences in wealth and education among urban residents. Additionally, contrary to the belief that migrants eventually adapt to their new environment, I find that outcomes and socioeconomic factors do not improve over time among rural-urban migrants. This paper deepens the understanding of urban child health and suggests that future research and policies should address the urban poor and uneducated.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_9ded293d635aa300a390f0111928f57f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Hassan, Sharif El Shishtawy. <emph render="italic">Islamic Education in the UAE: Promoting National Security, Refuting Islamists, and Nation Branding</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0167</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_5253879d1c96988f72b705265f14a471" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_5253879d1c96988f72b705265f14a471" type="Folder">2019-0167</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_4278accd750b774ab9bcb26dbd1eca2d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In recent years the content and character of state-sponsored religious education in the Middle East have been the subject of an intense debate. Upon analyzing the Islamic Education textbooks taught to all Muslim students in every school across the UAE, I make three arguments pertaining to the role of Islamic education in the UAE. First, the UAE's Islamic Education curriculum works to legitimize the state and promote nationalsecurity by inculcating in students a sense of loyalty to the nation and obedience to its ruler. Second, that the curriculum works to present an image, directed atlocal and international audiences, of religious moderation and tolerance. Third, that the curriculum works to support government objectives of economic growth by presenting the ideal Muslim as one who is hard-working and productive. I situate the UAE's Islamic Education curriculum and textbooks within broader, long-standing state efforts to cultivate a loyal citizenry devoted to state agendas related to political stability, modernization, and economic growth, refuting Islamists narratives, and being recognized by the West as a natural partner in the fight to eradicate religious extremism and promote tolerance in the region.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_d01a1cf6df72c3bf6f1a547391f4cdaa" level="file"><did><unittitle>Humayun, Aaima. <emph render="italic">"It is like my life has become an answer [to these questions]…": Understanding the Accounts of Acid Violence Victims in Pakistan</emph>

The victims of acid violence, in addition to the stigma associated with irrevocable physical disfigurement, also suffer the allegation of an immoral character, causing inflated psychological and social difficulties. Accounts allow stigmatized individuals to participate in strategies that enable their empowerment and inclusion in society. Drawing on a series of interviews with female victims of acid violence in Pakistan, this paper explores the discursive strategies employed by the victims across different situations.The findings suggest several patterns: providing unfiltered accounts, denying identity of a victim of violence, using socially acceptable language, embracing an identity of a professional, negotiating an increased social status, and shifting identities from that of a victim, to a survivor and a savior of other victims.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_a68ccc8ca26ec5ec844532bb3a6410ca" level="file"><did><unittitle>Imran, Rabiya. <emph render="italic">Women and Pakistani Sharia: A Case Study of Khula Laws</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0209</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e57320cf1e6e8e2e04f266c0e1a7fce3" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e57320cf1e6e8e2e04f266c0e1a7fce3" type="Folder">2019-0209</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0649cb93c2d500797745028162ec667d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>How is Sharia contextualized when granting rights to women in the post-colonial context?

My analysis examines eighteen cases from the Lahore High Court and five from the Punjab and Haryana Court in detail. I argue that in both India and Pakistan, Sharia and Islam are being utilized to create rights for women in the realm of divorce, where they don't exist through non-Islamic means. I also argue that in the Lahore High Court, the court uses language that is filled with Islamic symbolism to grant legitimacy to its decisions that are favorable to women. However, this symbolism is not found at the Punjab and Haryana High Court. To make sense of this variation, I argue, Shariah is used as a reliable device in both Islamic and non-Islamic contexts to achieve similar results, albeit with varying motivations.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1968cda27f6a0f9a7fe2453e20e1848b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Jo, Atoka. <emph render="italic">The Use of Pseudonym, Team Composition and Identity in Cryptocurrency</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0198</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_d94a131fe9f953fb046f8c5cbb9a6520" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_d94a131fe9f953fb046f8c5cbb9a6520" type="Folder">2019-0198</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_df088d26e3906b967e4d42e7d5c63b17"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Satoshi Nakamoto is known as the founder of Bitcoin and the pioneer of cryptocurrency.

Team composition and identity will be broken down to three components of publicity, technical roles, and gender of the cryptocurrency company members. By investigating the relationship between team composition and identity and the usage of pseudonyms, the study will demonstrate how pseudonyms can be used not only to hide one's identity, but also to augment one's identity.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_43bd510e3e8baab7b1b60d22b0dc463e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Karan, Filip. <emph render="italic">Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP): a Miracle Drug or a Moral Hazard?</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0180</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_f170b690aa5cc6d59ad1657b7a64c0a5" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_f170b690aa5cc6d59ad1657b7a64c0a5" type="Folder">2019-0180</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_48e9480e3677c5b2173f1c40dcc07bab"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Little is known about the way in which taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) affects sexual behavior and sexual health outcomes of men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). I examine these outcomes by using Facebook, Grindr and the Gay Ad Network as recruitment sites, linking ads to a questionnaire which 1823 US-based MSM completed. Using a series of one-sided t-tests, I find that MSM who are on PrEP have significantly more sexual partners, are more likely to be involved in concurrent relationships, use condoms less frequently and report higher incidences of bacterial STDs than MSM who are not on PrEP. I then use propensity score matching to control for a set of demographic and behavioral characteristics associated with PrEP use to estimate the effect of taking PrEP on the above-mentioned outcomes. I again find statistically significant results for all outcomes. Lastly, I employ a conjoint experiment to compare how MSM who are on PrEP compare to those who are not on PrEP make partner-selection decisions. I find that MSM on PrEP do not take the number of their partner's previous sexual relationships nor their condom use into account to make this decision, while those who are not on PrEP do.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ed8d3cff7b3dd9521265694fa9a027da" level="file"><did><unittitle>Karpauskaite, Ruta. <emph render="italic">NETWORKS OF INFLUENCE Think Tank Behavior, Relationships and Bias in Washington DC</emph>

While think tanks, in theory, are supposed to produce unbiased policy analysis and help promote informed debate--criticism of think tanks often alleges that they are far from unbiased. While such  literature has attempted to delineate this problem, most of the research has focused on external analysis of think tanks as part of the larger policymaking system. Leveraging ethnographic research conducted within the think tank community itself rather than externally, my analysis questions the consensus view that think tank behavior is largely driven by seeking policy impact; instead finding that think tank behavior is conducted according to internal and external relationships. With a greater understanding of think tank behavior, I seek to better understand the origin of bias and how it materializes in think tanks' most visible output - external research.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b1f2b3db999aeff048a97b3d343b9a94" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mahne, Matilda. <emph render="italic">Change in Peacebuilding Diplomacy: A Case Study of Finland</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0140</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_e637e2ec8d9e8d71ebd4e5a36abc3314" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_e637e2ec8d9e8d71ebd4e5a36abc3314" type="Folder">2019-0140</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_34bd3299c4dfc6dab4be0ddad6614f7f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In 2008, Finland created a National Action Plan for the implementation of the United Nations Security Council resolution on Women, Peace and Security that was unanimously adopted in October 2000. The resolution was significant as it was the first of its kind to specifically address women's role in conflict and peacebuilding. Though Finland has been on the forefront of the peacebuilding scene for years, the country shaped its action plan for the resolution a few years later than many other states. This research project looks deeper into this foreign policy change and endeavours to answer the following question: why did Finland adopt its National Action Plan for the United Nations Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security in 2008? By looking into policy documents and speeches, as well as drawing from public debate and previous literature on foreign policy change and policy diffusion, I find that the Finnish case warrants a multi-layered explanation: using the policy diffusion mechanisms of learning, competition, coercion and emulation, the drive for Finnish foreign policy change has taken place on three distinct levels (international, regional, and civil society), where the three levels mutually created the condition for change.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_1d8bbac320b29656bae3a53f8584d021" level="file"><did><unittitle>Malik, Warda. <emph render="italic">Religion, State, and Nation: Claims to Citizenship Among Pakistan's Ahmadiyya Community</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0186</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_5fb441b645339f8b2856de9f00de0f96" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_5fb441b645339f8b2856de9f00de0f96" type="Folder">2019-0186</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_837d0e5a2ce79169d92266aba917cf81"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This research focuses on Pakistan's Ahmadiyya community, who self-identity as Muslims but the state recognises them as a non-Muslim minority, to demonstrate how the state narratives about inclusion in Pakistan have been used to exclude and reduce this community to the status of second-class citizens. Most of the existing literature has focused on how the Pakistani nation- state has constructed its imagined community based on exclusionary citizenship, but little is said about the grievances that the marginalised have from the state and what it can teach us about national citizenship. Given the exclusion of Ahmadis from Pakistan's national discourse, I have conducted twelve semi-structured interviews with community members and conducted an analysis of op-ed articles in an alternative media publication to understand counter-narratives of Ahmadis in relation to the dominant narratives of state. This research focuses on counter-narratives of Ahmadis about Pakistani identity in order to broaden our understanding of identity through a focus on the excluded citizen rather than the State. The research sheds light on what national identity looks like when viewed through the lens of exclusion.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_6f3c89a238c1f6e900a99150add8943d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Olson, Erik. <emph render="italic">Neither Here nor There: Non-political transnationalism amongst Bosnian refugee families and the blurring of migrant taxonomies </emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0172</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_726c21d9d3be2b48d07f5427078fc0e2" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_726c21d9d3be2b48d07f5427078fc0e2" type="Folder">2019-0172</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_1a3f48996476d20f662ab3544a2b21d1"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Third-country resettlement is one of the UN's three "durable solutions" made available to refugees worldwide. While millions have benefitted from such programmes, there remains a gap in knowledge concerning the long-term effects of resettlement on the experiences of refugees. At the same time, migration studies literature has established a dichotomy between voluntary and involuntary migrants. Here, a tendency is shown which views connections to people in places in the country of origin as distinctly political in form and motivation. This essay takes a transnationalist approach to studying the experiences of Bosnian refugee families resettled to Boise, Idaho, USA during and immediately after the Bosnian War (1992-1995). Focusing on transnational practices developed by refugees over two decades in the United States, my analysis questions the prevailing image of refugees as inherently political transnational actors. This study investigates non-political forms of refugee transnationalism by examining patterns of ownership and flows of goods, funds, and people between Boise and Bosnia. In doing so, I seek to blur the lines between traditional migrant taxonomies and contribute to a more holistic understanding of the refugee as an informed and empowered international actor.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0b77fe2b57f0b6e64d1ebd0dbf40f60a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Szekeres, Melinda. <emph render="italic">Navigating Entrepreneurship: The Role of Law in Organizational Emergence in the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0171</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_0d200c54376940a5c3d31b3bb33b0c9d" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_0d200c54376940a5c3d31b3bb33b0c9d" type="Folder">2019-0171</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_277b84525c75f7a17bab889a8b7cb75a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This project observes the law and policy that govern entrepreneurship in the UAE, comparing it, empirically, to the lived experiences of entrepreneurs on the ground. I observe entrepreneurship as a novel work environment that offers starkly different experiences for UAE nationals and residents alike. The distinction, primarily, manifests in the levels of ease of organizational emergence for both groups. I suggest that the UAE offers a quasi-experimental insight into the two different pools of entrepreneurs that result by having a 'high' or 'low' bar—the former for residents and the latter for nationals. In comparing the experiences of entrepreneurs emerging across these two pools, this capstone asks whether a more 'helpful' legal and institutional environment increases the success the rates of entrepreneurial ventures. Based on its finding that the increased ease of starting up is not necessarily an advantage, this study complicates the theoretical assumption that low barriers to starting up are necessarily always preferred because they lead to a higher aggregate entrepreneurial activity.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_c37822977e9d7ba6a489f6d1710c943e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Wong, Theros. <emph render="italic">The Power of Ethnic Politics in Foreign Policy Making Decisions: A Comparison of Malaysia's Mahathir and the Philippines' Duterte in the Belt Road Initiative</emph></unittitle><unitid>2019-0196</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2019/2019">2019</unitdate><container id="aspace_a59e28df8d7e010006bc47b33f3949cd" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_a59e28df8d7e010006bc47b33f3949cd" type="Folder">2019-0196</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2470038cf9249201ffa717fc4c2b9b1b"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Malaysia's rejection of China's Belt Road Initiative came as a shock to the international community.

The experiment was conducted with a sample of working age and retired Canadians, outside the laboratory. During the experiment the participants have completed either self-affirmation task, perspective-taking task, combination of both tasks, or participated in a control condition before answering the measures of attitudes and perceived threat towards Syrian refugees and participating in the behavioral task measuring the respondents' readiness to support this outgroup. Results show that self-affirmation and combined intervention were effective in fostering inclusive behavior towards the outgroup. This study has also found that the middle aged respondents had less malleable views, and were less likely to be motivated to change their behavior by a one-time intervention. The participants between 35-54 years of age were more likely to hold strong unfavorable views of Syrian refugees due to the perceived competition over finite resources and welfare benefits in Canada. This paper also draws further implications for the researchers and policymakers.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_12bb630cd16b1b2d902b23baafb32fa8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ahmed, Hafsa. <emph render="italic">Bodies in Difference: 'Determination' in the Lived Experience of Disabilities in the UAE</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0176</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_3535cf98d9a91b465c96e91420a70350" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_3535cf98d9a91b465c96e91420a70350" type="Folder">2020-0176</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_70f57adecc78b892f0fd1a1102218b40"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>In the past decade, disabilities have gained unprecedented visibility in public discourse, popular media, and government action in the UAE. Following international events like Special Olympics World Games and the UAE's very own Year of Tolerance in 2019, an inquiry is necessitated into the implications of this new-found visibility and translation of federal and societal efforts into the day-to-day experiences of people of determination. Through qualitative data collection involving in-depth interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and document analysis, this ethnographic field research explores the lived experiences of disabilities in the UAE through analysing disability discourse among the groups of able-bodied and differently-abled individuals dubbed 'disability representatives', given their intimate understanding of the disability experience. The research explores perceptions in favor of and against the label 'people of determination' in understanding the role played by language in creating and maintaining stigmatised disability identities and overall lived experience of disabilities in the country. 'Determination' moves beyond existing as a mere characteristic and becomes associated with empowerment, heroism, harm, and modernism - all the while as a label, it becomes an active linguistic and social force shaping disability perceptions and experiences.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Even more recently, the UAE has begun to shift all modes of life, from business payments to government services, into a digitized sphere. The push of both entrepreneurship and further digitization within the UAE has in effect created bustling tech and entrepreneurial ecosystems, which often overlap. In this study, I analyze the interactions between the non-tech, or SME entrepreneurship ecosystem and the newer and more popular tech entrepreneurship ecosystem, using the experiences of tech and non-tech entrepreneurs as a mechanism through which the interactions between these two ecosystems; one that is becoming ideologically outdated and one that is possibly overrated, in an effort to understand the overall entrepreneurial ecosystem of the UAE and its actors and situate this progress within the fields of critical development theory and critical entrepreneurship studies.</p><p>Author approved keywords:

This study explores the effect of UAE National Service on the higher educational attainment of Emirati males. Using an online survey taken by 440 participants to conduct quantitative analysis, a series of informal interviews are drawn to explain the findings. Educational outcomes of high school cohorts prior to the implementation of the UAE National Service law, 2013 and earlier, and after the implementation of the law, 2014 and later, are compared using logistic regression models and other methods of statistical analyses. Drawing from a series of qualitative responses, the national service can either encourage higher education or act as a displaced time gap between high school education and higher education. By examining the highest degrees obtained and their intentions of pursuing a higher educational degree in the next five years, cohorts of 2014 and later are less likely to pursue a higher educational degree. Policy recommendations are suggested to bridge the gaps between high school education, national service, and higher education.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

This study also aims to investigate the effect of the two forms of childcare on the academic attainment of children. The research found that although kindergarten enrollment is not considered a substitute for mothers' involvement, children enrolled in kindergarten have higher chances of being exposed to informal childcare, compared to children who are not enrolled. Results also show that both forms of childcare have positive effects on the academic attainment of children. Lastly, the more the cultural capital of parents, the stronger the relationship is between formal childcare and attainment. These findings suggest that the goal of universalization should be carefully applied by the government to take into account the inequalities that could arise between the different groups of children.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

It entailed 707 U.S. adults evaluating 10 vignettes containing information about an employee (i.e., ego) and their coworker (i.e., alter). Respondents were asked to assess the fairness of ego's earnings and judge whether ego should negotiate for a higher salary. When information about the inequality of earnings (i.e., alter earning 30 percent more than ego) was provided, respondents rated ego's earnings as unfairly low and indicated support for ego's negotiation for a higher salary. Interestingly, under those same conditions, when alter's earnings were 30 percent higher than the earnings of a female ego, female respondents rated the earnings of a female ego as unfairly low (i.e., female egos should get paid more) and deemed that the female ego should negotiate for a higher salary (this effect was reversed for male respondents). Overall, I find that the effects of gender on perceptions of fairness of earnings and attitudes toward negotiation are highly situational and circumstantial.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Countries in the MENA region are unique in their approach to migration. Unlike those traditionally studied in the literature, they do not provide permanent residency or citizenship options to legal immigrants or their descendants. As such, the adult children of immigrants experience a process of 'aging out' of their legal status. This paper attempts to understand how the second-generation of Syrian immigrants to the UAE navigates this loss of status and subsequent legal precarity. Through interviews conducted with second-generation Syrian immigrants who underwent this process in the aftermath of the 2011 conflict, I broadly explore the question of how second-generation migrants negotiate legal precarity in their receiving countries. I find that in addition to utilizing strategies such as educational and professional attainment commonly discussed in the literature, these individuals strategize around obtaining legal documents in third countries. Their approach thus brings into question the significance of passports, residency, and citizenship - no longer merely markers of location or lineage, but as tools for upward mobility.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

This statement raises questions regarding the current situation; essentially, the questions all fall under what contributes to the extremely low rate.

The proposed study examines these questions through an online survey in which 748 Jordanians participated. Throughout this study, I will be taking a "micro lens", i.e., investigate the drivers that affect labor force participation as well as people's perceptions regarding gender equality in the workforce and the Jordanian society.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Language keeps social practices and cultures alive; therefore, loss of language would cause loss of community heritage and identity. Its preservation matters on multiple levels- not only for those who speak it, but for all of us. Language also helps us gain deeper insight into social cohesion, cultural reproduction, and human relations and negotiations in times of conflict and peace. A deeper understanding of linguistic diversity and the richness of associated cultures and traditions is of benefit to the global community.This capstone project focuses on the historical role and current status of two languages in two contexts: Irish in Ireland and Arabic in Israel. I chose to position these two languages at the heart of a comparative study because both Irish and Arabic are considered minority languages as well as 'heritage languages' within their respective national contexts, and both languages are often subordinate to the use of other dominant languages within those contexts.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_0b9a855b1faceec3b2db352e10f9e238" level="file"><did><unittitle>Kim, Sooji. <emph render="italic">Sustaining a Community in a Transient Setting: An Ethnographic Study on Abu Dhabi Singers</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0242</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_65f13e736b85627e255f6abc033e0664" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_65f13e736b85627e255f6abc033e0664" type="Folder">2020-0242</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_92cdbaef5633c6b708329d70cdc5e0ad"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Abu Dhabi has been described by several scholars as a place of temporariness with highly transient expatriate residents. Despite the city's transient nature, however, Abu Dhabi Singers (ADS), a community choir and musical theater group, has survived for 43 years. This group has succeeded in cultivating a deep sense of community for its members despite a member retention rate of less than 30%. Given this unique situation, what is the mechanism that enables groups such as ADS to survive transience and maintain a community when its members do not envision a long-term stay in the UAE? Through a year-long ethnography and interviews, this study shows that ADS developed a porous community-an inclusive community that endures constant membership changes-by deliberately blurring the precise boundary of membership and facilitating the integration of new members through socialization activities. This ethnographic case robustly illustrates how member retention strategy and commitment mechanisms play out in the transient environment, expanding the organizational sociology literature. This case also contributes to Gulf studies, adding complexity to its existing expatriate experience narrative by examining how expatriates cultivate a sense of belonging in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

However, once the number of Syrians surpassed the one million mark, the Lebanese government resorted to implementing the December 2014 policy to reduce the number of Syrians by increasing requirements to acquire legal status. Consequently, as of 2019, an estimated 74% of them lost their legal status. This paper examines the effects of this policy and seeks to answer the following questions - How is the integration of displaced Syrians in Lebanon affected when they are stripped of their legal status? What kind of NGO assistance is provided to displaced Syrians in Lebanon to facilitate their integration in a context without legal protection? Data for this study was collected through 25 in-depth interviews with NGO workers and Syrian refugees currently residing in Lebanon. This study reveals that while the legal system functions in a way that does not favor the integration of displaced Syrians, the improvisation of actors from the host community have made it temporarily possible for Syrians to integrate in Lebanon. This paper is timely as it concludes with recommendations for the new government formed in January 2020.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

The Louvre Abu Dhabi, commenced in 2007 and opened in 2018, is one of the projects as a result of the collaborative partnership between France and the UAE. Even though there is abundant theoretical research on its global diplomatic ambitions, economic benefits, and national aspiration for a new identity, very few studies have focused on visitors' study. To fill the gap, this article investigated the visitors' experience in the Louvre Abu Dhabi and their perception of the distinct museological approach that reflects the museum's specific missions and visions. Ethnographic field research has been conducted in the permanent gallery, which is composed of observations of visitors' behaviors and 40 interviews. The article identifies the overall architecture, internal organization and ambiance, and museum narrative as the three most significant dimensions that influence visitors' experience. The article concludes that a fulfilling visit in the Louvre Abu Dhabi is created by the multi-layered experience and attributes to positive perception about the museum distinguished by its modernity and uniqueness.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

It is a project that tackles two of the most pressing issues in the Mexican education system which are accessibility and quality. Rooting its pedagogy in literacy experiences, such as storytelling, craft making and book exploration, NDÖNÍ is promoting love for learning, a fundamental characteristic for long lasting human development. This study highlights how NDÖNÍ is helping children to flourish through two specific approaches: first, by creating spaces for the users to exercise their agency and the second, by providing opportunities for children to develop expressivity. By grounding learning experiences in the immediate social surroundings and cultural context, this library is adapting its educational activities to the needs of the communities it visits. Its aim is to see children and culture flourish in Tequisquiapan. This ethnography presents an account of children whose love for learning has already germinated. It also poses questions for the future, specifically, how NDÖNÍ is going to foster love for learning in broader communities through collaborations with schools and families.</p><p>Mobile Library, Human Flourishing, Love for Learning, Literacy</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_4efb287c34ea631db4738d86bb6fb8ca" level="file"><did><unittitle>Shahran, Farah Mohamad. <emph render="italic">Love from a Distance: Reconfiguring Motherhood in the case of Filipina Migrants in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)</emph></unittitle><unitid>2020-0173</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2020/2020">2020</unitdate><container id="aspace_cc60e2a1761edb363118eaf5e01edb5e" label="Mixed Materials" type="E-records">AD-MC-004</container><container parent="aspace_cc60e2a1761edb363118eaf5e01edb5e" type="Folder">2020-0173</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_d4c61512930c0599f48c507e70d5155d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>With the rise of female migration, academic research has concentrated on migrant mothers and their motherhood experiences in the transnational context. However, little attention has been paid to how migrant mothers carry out different strategies to meet their maternal responsibilities while being abroad. In particular, the influence of gender roles and local network support on their mothering strategies has been given scant attention in transnational motherhood literature. By applying the concept of "kin work" and "gender ideologies" by Di Leonardo and Arlie Hochschild respectively, this paper seeks to understand how migrant mothers reconstruct the concept of motherhood post-migration. Drawing on 15 semi-structured interviews with Filipina migrant workers in the United Arab Emirates, my research has shown that migrant mothers interweave breadwinning with motherhood by practicing a transitional marriage model. They also perform kin work as a way to maintain kinship ties with different individuals such as family members, friends and neighbors and lean on them for practical support to ensure their children receive caregiving. This research has contributed to a better understanding of how transnational mothers form new meanings of motherhood to accommodate temporal and spatial separation from their children and family.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

This study explores the conditions which promote or hinder students' social integration, a key factor in students' well-being. Many adolescents in Athens are in a critical stage for long term development and must cope with multiple levels of vulnerability including financial instability, migrant backgrounds and previous trauma. The focus neighborhood, Kypseli, is a diverse community of students who are Greek, second generation migrants and refugees. This study takes a mixed-methods approach using both qualitative interviews with parents, teachers and NGO employees and quantitative surveys with students. The findings reveal that students' language barrier, intent to stay in Greece and friendship with an ingroup member are conditions that promote social integration; however, refugees have significantly lower measures on all of these variables. It is recommended that policies take into account the refugee students' perception of Greece as a temporary space; their challenge due to the language barrier; and conditions which would enable refugee students to develop intergroup friendships in an effort to integrate with the community.</p><p>Author provided keywords:

Through semi-structured interviews, I analyse the divergence in narratives between students that choose to attain education and those that drop out. I investigate the challenges behind the attainment of education, specifically, cultural barriers such as early marriage. Findings indicate that while girls who complete education are goal-oriented, the community, particularly female figureheads, play a decisive role in modelling behaviour reflective of the consequences of attaining education. Therefore, Swahili girls draw cues from female figureheads to fuel their motivation for education. Findings are consistent with previous research, although this paper highlights modes of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in response to the risk factor of early marriage in the attainment of education. More importantly, this paper shows how poverty complicates the proliferation of traditions that demotivate the education of Swahili girls. To increase education attainment rates amongst the Swahili, this paper suggests an integrated approach to the issue of economic and cultural barriers to education, by increasing education access and empowering not just the girls, but the community, on the importance of education.</p><p>Author provided keywords:
