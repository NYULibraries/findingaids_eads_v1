            <abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract">This collection documents the activities of Irish county societies in New York City. The organizations were first established in the late 1840s as social organizations, although later some groups began to intercede on behalf of evicted Irish tenants and offer benefits for sickness and death. Sports teams, especially hurling and Gaelic football, eventually became an important aspect of the societies. This collection consists of printed materials such as photographs, correspondence, circular letters, dinner journals, program flyers, meeting minutes, financial records, and other printed ephemera related to these societies’ activities.</abstract>

            <p>The collection consists primarily of printed materials such as circular letters, dinner journals and flyers related to the activities of Irish county societies based in New York City, dating mostly from the twentieth century. Dinner-dances, balls and events in conjunction with St. Patrick's Day, and activities of hurling and Gaelic football clubs are extensively documented in the collection.</p>
            <p>All of the series contain journals and programs from dances and banquets. Of special note in the collection are Series XI: Fermanagh, XV: Kilkenny, and Series XXV: Roscommon. In addition to programs and journals, these series also contain financial records, correspondence, membership logs and information, and minutes. Photographs of social events, most unidentified, can be found in the Clare, Fermanagh and Roscommon series. Series XXVI: Sligo contains a published history of the County Sligo assocation in New York. Series VI: Cork contains a County Cork Flag filed with an obituary in remembrance of Dr. Maire Bradshaw, sister of the Mayor of Limerick and a Ph.D. in zoology and botany. Dr. Bradshaw held the position of Assistant Director of Scientific Research for the Helena Rubenstein Comsmetics Corporation in New York and later worked for New York City's Department of Health in the Bureau of Radiation Control.</p>

            <p>Irish county organizations were first organized in New York City in the late 1840s. The early societies were for the most part purely social organizations, but in the 1870s some started to offer benefits for sickness and death. Sports teams eventually became an important component of county organizations, especially hurling and Gaelic football clubs. In the 1880s, inspired by the land reform movement in Ireland, many additional county societies were organized. Evictions and high rents were often fought on a local basis in Ireland, and in New York a county society rather than one of the broader Irish fraternal or social organizations could often respond better or faster to sudden developments in the old country. In the early 1890s the first attempt was made to establish a central body to coordinate the Irish county societies; such an organization was set up in Manhattan and at the same time a similar coordinating body was formed in Brooklyn, where many county societies existed independently. Both of these overseeing bodies were similar in design to the present-day United Irish Counties Association (UICA), but after only a few years of work the early umbrella organizations went out of existence.</p>
