            <abstract id="ref2231" label="Abstract">The Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) was founded in 1919 by members of the left wing of the Socialist Party USA. The CPUSA, and affiliated organizations, went on to play a prominent role in the labor movement, in the struggle for civil rights for African-Americans, and in many other campaigns and movements. By the 1940s the Party had achieved considerable influence in the Left, but Cold War prosecution and harrassment of the Party, and shifting currents in the international communist movement resulted in a decline in Party strength after the early 1950s. Nevertheless, in the Civil Rights Movement, in the New Left, and in the gender and ethnic politics of the 70s, 80s, and after, the Party continued to play a significant role. This collection is comprised of the miscellaneous audiotapes found at the New York headquarters of the CPUSA in the summer of 2006. Included are recordings of official meetings of the Party at the national level, such as National Conventions, Central Committee and Political Bureau meetings; as well as meetings of district, state, youth and special-interest organizations. Also included are recordings of public meetings, conferences, rallies, lectures, radio and TV interviews, election campaign materials, and music.</abstract>

            <p>The Communist Party of the USA Audio Collection was transferred to the Tamiment Library/Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives as part of the donation of the Communist Party of the USA archives and the Library of the Reference Center for Marxist Studies in the summer of 2006. A group of additional materials, clearly from the collection of materials in the first donation, was found at the Tamiment Library in May 2014, and added to the to the Collection.

            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

            <p>This collection is comprised of the miscellaneous audio tapes (both reel-to-reel tapes and audio cassettes), and a small amount of video, stored in various offices at the New York headquarters of the Communist Party, USA and transferred to the Tamiment Library, NYU in the summer of 2006.

Speakers include official Party representatives such as Gus Hall, Herbert Aptheker, Angela Davis, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, James Jackson, Jarvis Tyner, Charlene Mitchell, and Henry Winston.

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The Communist Party, USA was founded in 1919 by members of the left wing of the Socialist Party USA. The CPUSA played an important role in the labor movement, particularly in building the Congress of Industrial Organizations in the 1930s-1940s, and in struggles for civil rights for African Americans. The Party's cultural initiatives in the 1930s attracted a number of prominent artists and intellectuals, and its struggles to attain and maintain its legality were an important chapter in the history of U.S. civil liberties. Though the importance of the CPUSA declined after the 1950s, the Party remained active in the areas of anti-imperialism, civil rights, labor, peace, and women's rights.</p>

                    <p>Series II: Reel-to-Reel Audio Tapes: Public Events and Messages, 1920s-1984. This series is comprised of reel-to-reel recordings of public events and related material; including speeches, rallies, conferences, radio interviews and election campaign materials, in addition to audio material for film.</p>
                    <p>Subseries II:A: Events, 1920s-1984 Included in this subseries are recordings of Communist Party, USA events which were open to the public, as well as events organized by outside groups. The events include rallies, speeches, conferences, memorial services, and election campaign appearances, among others.</p>
                    <p>Subseries II:B: Radio and Television, 1957-1982 Party members were frequently interviewed on radio and television, and a variety of Communist Party campaign materials aired in support of Gus Hall and Jarvis Tyner during the 1972 and 1976 presidential elections, and for Gus Hall and Angela Davis’ 1980 and 1984 election campaigns.</p>
                    <p>Subseries II:C: Film Material, 1966-1972 This small subseries is comprised of audio material produced for documentary film projects.</p>
                    <p>Subseries II:D: Unidentified, 1965-1976 Containers for these reel-to-reel tapes did not provide sufficient information for adequate identification; in most cases the tapes are too fragile to be played on ordinary equipment. Further efforts will be made to identify them under properly controled conditions.</p>
                    <p>Subseries II:E: Original Containers Original containers for reel-to-reel tapes, numbered and retained when the original tapes were reboxed. Notations on these boxes can be consulted if queries arise as to the contents of individual tapes. Boxes without notations were not retained.</p>
