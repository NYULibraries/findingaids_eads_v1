<p>The New York City Commission on the Bicentennial of the Constitution was established in September 1986 by Mayor Edward Koch. Its mandate was "to remind New York's citizenry that the Constitution is a reality in our daily lives and that it works only as well as the degree to which we take seriously our responsibility to govern ourselves." The Commission sponsored various public education programs. </p><p>Among the Commission's projects was the organization and administration of the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration. Events included re-enactment of Washington's journey from Mount Vernon and arrival at Wall Street, a symposium on the modern presidency, a flotilla, parade, fireworks, religious service, ceremony at Federal Hall, and others. </p><p>(The above note was based on publicity documents in the collection.)</p>  </bioghist>
