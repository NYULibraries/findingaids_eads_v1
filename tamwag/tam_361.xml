            <p>Upon receipt, most materials were in labeled folders. The National Council for American-Soviet Friendship materials were in separate boxes upon receipt. Original folder titles were inscribed by Richard Morford as well as by his biographer, Kathy Kahn. Kahn had custody of a portion of Morford’s files during the 1980s and some order was imposed by her in the course of preparing to write Morford’s biography. Folders were grouped by phase of Morford’s life (and loosely correlate with the organization of the autobiographical manuscript) and arranged in rough chronological order. Many folders contain notes written by Morford or Kahn, and explain the contents of the folder or what was happening in his life at that point. These folder groupings and titles were kept when possible and were arranged by the archivist into chronological order.</p>

                    <label>Richard Morford</label>
                    <item>Reverend Richard Morford (1903-1986) was born in Onaway, Michigan and graduated from Albion College in Albion, Michigan. In the summer after graduating from Albion College in 1925, Morford traveled in Europe under the sponsorship of the youth division of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, the Fellowship of Youth for Peace. During this trip he met with other youth groups to discuss ways to achieve a durable peace. In the fall of that year, Morford started as a teacher and principal of the high school in Romeo, Michigan, which he continued until 1928. 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/> Morford moved to New York City where he prepared for the Presbyterian ministry at Union Theological Seminary and was a student minister at Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church. At the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church he met Aileen Hutson, whom he married in 1932. In June of 1931 he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. In 1932 Morford received a Master’s Degree in Philosophy of Education from Teachers College, Columbia University. From 1931 until 1936 Morford served as the Minister of Education in the Presbyterian Church of Morristown, New Jersey. In 1936 he and his family moved to Albany, New York, where he worked as the associate secretary of Protestant Family Welfare and as minister of the House of Friendship. The House of Friendship was a non-denominational mission church and community center with a low-income constituency. Additionally, he helped organize and was the executive secretary of the Federation of Churches in Albany and Vicinity. He was also president of the Albany Consumers’ Cooperative during the period 1938-1942. 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/> In 1942 the Morford family moved back to New York City. From 1942-1945 he was the Executive Secretary of the United Christian Council for Democracy, a national federation of six unofficial social, education, and action organizations in major Protestant denominations. In January 1946 Morford became executive director the National Council for American Soviet Friendship (NCASF), which was founded in November 1943. While Executive Director of the NCASF, Morford remained active with the Presbytery of New York City, serving as Chair of the Ministerial Fellowship committee during 1967-1971 and as Chair of its Committee on Social Concerns and Committee on Session Records starting in 1972. In the 1960s and early 1970s Morford was a member of the Executive Committee of the Methodist Federation for Social Action. In 1980, he became President of Chi Alpha, the oldest clerical club in the country, founded in 1829. 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/> In the 1960s and early 1970s Morford was on the National Advisory Committee of the Citizens’ Committee for Constitutional Liberties. In the mid-1960s Morford was an organizer and member of the Executive Committee of the National Committee to Repeal the McCarran Act. Morford was a founder and board member of the Consumer-Farmer Milk Cooperative of New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania starting in 1945 and its successor organization, the Consumer-Farmer Foundation starting in 1971. By the 1980s the organization’s work included rehabilitation housing. 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/> The program of the NCASF emphasized cultural interchange and education as a means of strengthening the bonds of understanding between the American and Soviet people. The Council believed their most important project was to promote cultural exchange at the local level. The NCASF set up special committees that sponsored various conferences, exhibits, and cultural activities. The Council also issued numerous pamphlets and bibliographies about life in the Soviet Union, as well as information on American-Soviet relations. 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/> In November 1945, a few months before Morford started as Executive Director, the Council was served a subpoena to submit its membership and financial records to the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). Morford appeared before the committee but refused to turn over the records. NCASF contended it was not engaged in un-American or subversive propaganda activities and was not, therefore, subject Committee’s authority or demand for its private records. After legal proceedings which included an unsuccessful appeal to the Supreme Court, Morford served three months for contempt of Congress in August through November 1950. In 1947, the NCASF was indicted for failure to register with the Subversive Activities Control Board. In 1951, the Supreme Court ruled that the Attorney General acted arbitrarily and illegally by placing the Council on the List of Subversive Organizations. In April, 1953, the Subversive Activities Control Board found the Council to be a Communist front organization. Morford carried the issue to the Circuit Court where in May 1963, a unanimous finding overturning the SACB finding was handed down. 
                        <lb/>
                        <lb/> In March 1974, he was awarded the Medal of Friendship of the Peoples by the USSR Supreme Soviet. He retired from the NCASF and was elected Executive Director emeritus in 1981. After retiring he served actively on the Council’s Executive Committee. Morford was awarded the Peacemaking Ministry Award by the Presbytery of New York in January 1981, which recognized his work for international reconciliation. Richard Morford passed away in September 1986.

In the course of preparing to write his biography, Kahn produced several interviews with Morford and had custody of an autobiographical manuscript that he produced and many of his files. These materials were then transferred to Linda Anderson, Morford’s daughter. Kahn never produced a published biography of Richard Morford.</item>

            <p>The Richard Morford Papers document the professional and activist activities of Reverend Richard Morford from the late 1910s through the mid-1980s. These activities are documented through correspondence, publications, worship materials including sermons, administrative files, clippings, conference materials, press releases, official reports, and photographs.

                    <p>This series contains materials created and collected by Richard Morford as Executive Director of the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship (NCASF) during 1946-1981 and as Executive Director Emeritus and member of the Executive Council during 1981-1986. Many of these materials document events and cultural programming organized by the Council, including exhibits, lists of films and books about the USSR for distribution to local councils, trade unions and schools, publications about the USSR, youth tours to the USSR and delegations from the US and from the USSR. Speeches, press releases, and other materials document the Council’s Annual Rally for Peace and Friendship held every in year in November in New York City. The Council’s response to current events, such as the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the Vietnam War are also documented in this collection. These responses can be seen in internal documents such as memoranda and in official statements, fact sheets, reports, articles in 
                        <emph render="italic">The New World Review</emph>, and press releases. Also included in this series are general administrative files, including financial documents, board materials, and correspondence, memoranda, and other materials related to other members of the NCASF, including William Howard Melish, Corliss Lamont, Alan Thomson, and Rockwell Kent. There are materials related to issues such as civil liberties and the McCarran Act, but the legal troubles of Morford and the NCASF in the 1940s and 1950s are not well documented.</p>
