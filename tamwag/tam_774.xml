      <head>Historical Note</head>
      <p>The Chiapas Media Project, founded in 1998 by Alexandra Halkin and Paco Vazquez,
        facilitated the production and distribution of media through four regional media centers
        built and equipped in collaboration with the Zapatista communities in Chiapas, Mexico. The
        Chiapas Media Project collaboratively produced 32 documentaries for international
        distribution, largely authored by community members themselves. The films, which focus on
        issues such as indigenous sovereignty, indigenous cultural practices, environmental
        sustainability, sustainable food practices, and autonomous education, have been screened at
        over 120 film festivals in 20 countries between 1998 and 2010, as well as many college and
        university campuses and other locations across the globe. The Chiapas Media Project is now
        known as Promedios de Comunicación Comunitaria, and has been a part of the Americas Media
        Initiative since 2010. Promedios continues to work with indigenous and non-indigenous
        communities in Southern Mexico providing audiovisual training and technical support.</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>At the time of accessioning, audiovisual materials were separated from the archival
        collection for bibliographic management. The remaining collection was rehoused in archival
        boxes and described on the collection-level with a box-level inventory.</p>
      <p>In July of 2022, the collection was arranged and described by an archivist. The collection
        was divided into Series based on record type and material was arranged intellectually within
        these Series. Wherever possible, record titles were taken directly from inventories or
        labels provided by the donor. Physically, audiovisual items are stored together with others
        of the same format.</p>
      <p>One VHS tape (774_237) had a cracked cartridge, which was repaired by the Media
        Preservation Unit in July, 2022. </p>
      <p>Born-digital items were identified, physically separated, and forensically imaged,
        analyzed, and described. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and
        best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to
        maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.</p>
