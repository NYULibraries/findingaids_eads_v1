            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Michael Harrington (1928-1989), a U.S. socialist writer and political leader, best known as the author of 
                <title render="italic">The Other America: Poverty in the United States</title>(1962), and as the founder and leader of Democratic Socialists of America, the U.S. affiliate to the Socialist International, was born in St. Louis, received a Jesuit secondary education, graduated from Holy Cross College in 1947 and, after a brief interval at Yale Law School, received a MA degree in English from the University of Chicago in 1949, then moved to New York City.</p>
            <p>From 1951-53 he was a volunteer at the radical Catholic Worker house on New York's Lower East Side, and was associate editor of its newspaper, also called the 
                <title render="italic">Catholic Worker</title>. Leaving Catholicism, he first became organizational director of the Workers Defense League in 1953, joined the Socialist Party, and shortly became the leader of the SP's Young People's Socialist League. Coming under the influence of the (not quite yet) post-Trotskyist Max Shachtman, whose anti-Communism and grand political strategy, known as realignment (i.e., seeking to employ a leftist-influenced organized labor movement as the leading force in reorienting the Democratic Party towards socialism) became and remained in one form or another the cornerstones of Harrington's political outlook, Harrington led the New York YPSL into Shachtman's Independent Socialist League in 1954, and served as YPSL national chair until the 1958 dissolution of the ISL and its members' return to the Socialist Party, and from 1960-62 edited 
                <title render="italic">New America</title>, the SP paper.</p>
            <p>From 1954 through 1962, Harrington worked as a researcher for the Fund for the Republic, notably on its study of blacklisting in the film industry, and wrote for liberal and left journals of opinion such as 
                <title render="italic">Dissent</title>. A 1957 
                <title render="italic">Commentary</title>article on poverty grew into 
                <title render="italic">The Other America</title>, which made Harrington a national figure, and which was widely credited with influencing the development of the so-called War on Poverty and related local programs during the Kennedy and Johnson presidencies. The 
                <title render="italic">Port Huron Statement</title>, also published in 1962 by the Students for a Democratic Society, originally a project of the SP-associated League for Industrial Democracy, for whom Harrington served as liaison to SDS (he would become LID head in 1964), was sharply criticized by Harrington for being insufficiently anti-Communist. This marked the beginning of a decade of often sharp disagreement with the New Left, most importantly on the related issue of the Vietnam War. While Harrington's Realignment Caucus within the SP (he was elected SP chair in 1968) opposed the war, it did not support unconditional withdrawal. In 1971 Harrington formed the Coalition Caucus, which backed the 1972 presidential candidacy of George McGovern in opposition to the pro-war SP majority, then left the SP to found (in February 1973) the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, which merged, in 1982, with the New American Movement, an organization of New Left veterans, to form the Democratic Socialists of America.</p>
            <p>In 1972 Harrington became a professor of political science at Queens College in New York City, played a leading role during the 1980s in the drafting of the Socialist International's New Declaration of Principles, and continued to write, lecture and travel widely until his death from cancer in 1989. Among his many books were two autobiographical works, 
                <title render="italic">Taking Sides: The Education of a Militant Mind</title>(1985) and 
                <title render="italic">The Long-Distance Runner : An Autobiography</title>(1987), 
                <title render="italic">The New American Poverty</title>(1984), 
                <title render="italic">The Politics at God's Funeral: The Spiritual Crisis of Western Civilization</title>(1985), and 
                <title render="italic">Socialism : Past and Future</title>(1989). See also the selected bibliography, below, preceding the box and folder list.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The notebooks (which are undated) are arranged alphabetically. They comprise more than three-fourths of the collection, and contain Harrington's handwritten notes on his readings from the 1960s through the 1980s, principally of the works of Marx, Hegel, Continental and ancient Greek philosophy, current economic and social conditions, political economy, political theory, theology, and American and European literature. Harrington read works in their original languages, and the sometimes multi-lingual notes reflect Harrington's facility with French, German, Greek and Latin. About one-third of the often multi-volume notebooks are labeled with abbreviated titles for several of Harrington's published books, notably 
                <title render="italic">Toward a Democratic Left</title>(1968), 
                <title render="italic">Twilight of Capitalism</title>(1976), and 
                <title render="italic">Decade of Decision</title>(1980), while the remainder are labeled with broad topical terms or the names of prominent authors. Of interest for Harrington's early years in New York are the notebooks titled "Me - Boheme," and "Village."</p>
            <p>Series two, arranged alphabetically by topic, contains typescripts for unpublished and published articles, book reviews, lectures, speeches, and for a debate with Carl Gershman; three audio recordings of lectures on Marxism; typescripts for 
                <title render="italic">The New American Poverty</title> (1984) and 
                <title render="italic">Socialism, Past and Future</title> (partial, 1989); three oral history interview transcripts (1965, 1988); documents from and unpublished Harrington reports on several Socialist International leadership meetings, including one discussing the Palestine Liberation Organization (1979); additional reading notes; publishing and miscellaneous correspondence; clippings; materials relating to Harrington's teaching career; U.S. Senate testimony (1987); and an invitation to the funeral of Robert F. Kennedy.</p>
