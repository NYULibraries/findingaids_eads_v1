    <abstract id="aspace_8d9659e654c1cdde4c88df85f638c3de">Latinos Unidos Con Honor y Amistad (L.U.C.H.A) is a student organization focused on unifying, educating, and empowering Latinos both on the NYU campus and in their respective communities. The organization was founded in 1971 as the League of Unified Cooperative Hispanic Americans, and changed its name to L.U.C.H.A. in 1994 to more fully represent the relationship between struggle and accomplishment and recall the phrase "¡Que siga la lucha!" L.U.C.H.A. holds regular meetings, sponsors social and academic events, facilitates service initiatives, and endeavors to improve the campus experience for Latino students at NYU. This collection consists of materials created and collected by L.U.C.H.A. and its predecessor organization from 1990-2005, including meeting notes, a student coordinator handbook, photographic prints, and ephemera publicizing the organization's meetings, social events, and sponsored conferences, such as the Latino Unity Conference.</abstract>
