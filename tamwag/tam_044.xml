Witherspoon, it was the first organization to furnish free legal advice and counsel to anyone who came into conflict with the new laws related to America's entry into World War I, including draft resisters, conscientious objectors, and deserters.

            <p>The 1917-1919 records of the New York Bureau of Legal Advice had been stored in the Tamiment Library Collection among old file boxes and cartons relating to World War I. In 1961 Professor Martin David Dubin of Roosevelt University began researching, processing and ordering the papers of the Bureau. He returned the collection to Tamiment Library in 13 document boxes (5.5 linear feet) in 1970. The Swarthmore College Peace Collection also holds a large fragment of the organization's office files, "which fit into the Tamiment portions like parts of a jigsaw puzzle," according to Professor Dubin. Also in the Swarthmore College Peace Collection are the personal papers of two principles of the organization, Frances M. Witherspoon, Secretary of the Bureau and Tracy Dickinson Mygatt, a member of the Executive Committee and Miss Witherspoon's companion.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The New York Bureau of Legal First Aid was organized on May 11, 1917 with a one hundred dollar grant from the Women's Peace Party. Individuals contributed to the treasury and in August the People's Council, the Socialist Party, the Civil Liberties Bureau and the Workmen's Council all became sponsoring affiliates. A few months later the People's Council and the Civil Liberties Bureau withdrew their support, but a strong Executive Committee continued the organizing work. In May 1918, the organization changed its name to the New York Bureau of Legal Advice (NYBLA). During that year, the Bureau estimated that it aided at least 5,000 clients. In September 1918, a raid by the Federal Bureau of Investigation disrupted organizational functioning temporarily. NYBLA continued with its anti-war campaigns and only ended its work in the autumn of 1919, shortly before the Armistice.</p>
            <p>NYBLA was the first organization to furnish free legal advice and counsel to anyone who came into conflict with the new laws related to America's entry into World War I, including draft resisters, conscientious objectors, and deserters. The Bureau sought to gather information and investigate and publicize war-related instances of infringements of First Amendment rights. The Bureau campaigned for amnesty for conscientious objectors and also monitored their treatment in military prisons. Lobbying by NYBLA was instrumental in forcing Secretary of War Newton B. Baker to order an end to the practice of holding conscientious objectors in manacles. The Bureau cooperated actively with the Industrial Workers of the World and other radical groups in defense of free speech and in opposition to the deportation of immigrant radicals.</p>
            <p>Charles Recht, a Czech-born attorney, was the General Counsel of the Bureau. As Secretary of the Bureau, Frances M. Witherspoon, an ardent feminist and socialist peace activist, carried on the daily work of the Bureau, including fundraising, working with attorneys and volunteers, organizing lobbying campaigns, maintaining correspondence, and interviewing clients. She worked with the leading socialists, anti-war activists and civil libertarians of the time, including Roger N. Baldwin, Ella Reeve ("Mother") Bloor, M. Eleanor Fitzgerald, Albert De Silver, Jacob Hillquit, and Scott Nearing.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>Approximately half of the records of the New York Bureau of Legal Advice consist of case histories pertaining to selective service exemption, draft evasion, conscientious objector status, military imprisonment, military discharge, desertion, amnesty, civil liberties and deportations. Approximately one third of the collection consists of office files, administrative reports and correspondence, including extensive fundraising correspondence. The remainder of the collection is made up of press releases and newspaper clippings.</p>
            <p>The case histories, chiefly relating to draft exemption, provide significant and frequently poignant information on the daily lives and problems of the working class immigrants who were the principal clients of the Bureau's pioneering efforts to deliver free legal services and to protect poor people's civil rights. The correspondence and office files reflect civil liberties activity and the Bureau's role as a connecting link between "those on the firing line in anti-war agitation" and America's large and politically diverse peace and socialist movements.</p>
            <p>The correspondents to the NYBLA are numerous and varied; many well known progressives of the period made a contribution to the Bureau's work. Among them are Mary Beard, Sarah N. Cleghorn, Elizabeth Gurley and Bina Flynn, Agnes Smedley, Louis Untermeyer, Thorsten Veblen, H. L. Mencken, Sinclair Lewis, Judah L. Magnes, and Stephen Wise.</p>

                    <p>This series consists of correspondence with individuals and organizations. Along with individual correspondents' files, there are files of Miscellaneous writers after each alphabetical category. A substantial number of the letters are carbons of Miss Witherspoon's fund raising messages. Her individual appeals to friends of the bureau and assiduous hunt for donations and pledges led her to correspond with such noteworthy supporters as H. L. Mencken, Sinclair Lewis, Louis Untermeyer, Thorsten Veblen, and Upton Sinclair. The correspondence files also show that a strong network of progressive organizations bolstered the NYBLA.</p>

                    <p>This series contains correspondence, affidavits, legal notices, clippings and legal transcripts relating to deportations and other actions threatened by the government against immigrants and opponents of the war effort. Notable among these papers are documents of the Chinese United Association, a Chinatown labor organization, and case files on Gertrude Pignol, a New York City high school teacher dismissed from her position because of her opposition to the war, and on the Italian labor activist Arturo Giovanetti.</p>
