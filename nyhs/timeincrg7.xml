    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p><title render="italic">Time</title> is the first magazine created by Time Inc. and was the impetus to form the publishing company. <title render="italic">Time</title> launched its first issue on March 3, 1923. Time Inc. cofounders Henry R. Luce and Briton Hadden shared the masthead as Editors until Hadden's death in 1929. At this time, John S. Martin became the first Managing Editor of Time with Luce still over him as Editor.</p><p>According to Time Inc., <title render="italic">Time</title> pioneered the news magazine, at least the modern news magazine. <title render="italic">Time</title>'s format of short articles summarizing news events and other items of interest and importance became the standard for later news magazines. Magazine sections included national and international affairs, business, education, science, medicine, law, religion, sports, books, and the arts.</p><p><title render="italic">Time</title> published several foreign-language editions, the first launched in 1941 delivered by air service to Latin America; special issues including the popular <title render="italic">Time</title> Person of the Year (formerly Man of the Year); and <title render="italic">Time for Kids</title>, a children's magazine.
  
For the majority of Time Inc.'s existence, the company maintained a strict separation of editorial from the publishing and business side of each magazine, colloquially called the separation of "church" (editorial) and "state" (publishing). Editorial includes the editors, researchers, and art department. The editorial side reported up to the editor-in-chief and the publishing/business side reported up to the corporate business executive which was the president prior to 1960 and the chief executive officer after. Henry Luce structured Time Inc. this way so that the business side could not (in theory) influence the editorial content of the publications. For example, the advertising sales people could not interfere with a magazine's decision to run an article on the dangers of cigarette smoking, even though it might mean losing millions of dollars in tobacco ads.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica.

He served as a senior editor and assistant managing editor, and was promoted to managing editor in 1960. Fuerbringer held this title until May 1968 when Hedley Donovan appointed him as the "chief explorer of Time Inc.'s interests and opportunities in the newspaper field," making him a vice president.

Some of these files state that they are "from correspondence." Materials remaining in the unprocessed General files are similar to materials found throughout the files created by the Time Inc. Archives which may mean the processing was incomplete. </p><p>General includes letters from subjects of <title render="italic">Time</title> covers (Barbara Streisand and an assistant to Martin Luther King, Jr.); invitations to events and to speak; from various companies including Ford Motor Company; and from social organizations (Harvard Club of New York). Biographical contains personal correspondence, letters from school acquaintances, and a 1939 article on Fuerbringer from <title render="italic">St. Louis Post Dispatch</title>. Frank Shea was the assistant to the managing editor, and his correspondence primarily contains responses to readers on the behalf of Bernard Auer, Roy Alexander, and Fuerbringer during their absences.

Newstours includes briefing binders containing itineraries, participant lists, and background information; cables, memoranda, and other correspondence; notes; and travelogues written by Fuerbringer and other participants.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_75baad2008975a54ca12b5af3437ee1d"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Organized chronologically by year of newstour.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref1115_0ob" level="file"><did><unittitle>1963: <title render="italic">Time</title> News Tour of Europe</unittitle><unitdate normal="1963/1963" type="inclusive">1963</unitdate><container id="aspace_bae6cf26c00d8f0488e669c7a568a0ab" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00001 6398]" type="Offsite-Box">1260</container><container parent="aspace_bae6cf26c00d8f0488e669c7a568a0ab" type="Folder">6-9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1116_xfh" level="file"><did><unittitle>1965: <title render="italic">Time</title> News Tour of Asia</unittitle><unitdate normal="1964/1965" type="inclusive">1964-1965</unitdate><container id="aspace_489b31b84d206d466f739a748a8b78ab" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00001 6398]" type="Offsite-Box">1260</container><container parent="aspace_489b31b84d206d466f739a748a8b78ab" type="Folder">10-14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b0c99f2b920a205e18b94e43ff51a801" level="file"><did><unittitle>1966: <title render="italic">Time</title> News Tour of Eastern Europe</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1966</unitdate><container id="aspace_f5e7e1501d6f0dd910f28f8ea371e459" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00001 6398]" type="Offsite-Box">1260</container><container parent="aspace_f5e7e1501d6f0dd910f28f8ea371e459" type="Folder">15</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref1118_f1z" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries I.A.4.

While <title render="italic">Time</title> only acquired the first publication rights for its cover art, it might purchase the original work to gift.

Presenters included cofounder Henry R. Luce, Editorial Vice President Eric Hodgins, Publisher P. I. Prentice, or any other <title render="italic">Time</title> employee who had a specific relationship with the recipient.

Inventories include reports from the Business Manager James Thomason on covers still in the "bank" for future use with responses from Tasker on which ones to "kill," removing them from storage by returning to the artist or other method. Records also include other interoffice memoranda arranging presentations, correspondence to and from the gift recipients, and framing and shipping invoices.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_a66dd1dae53543da1f5cc75444692c4f"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Organized alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_026fcb8182505d481d9d6152b89804e8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cover Inventories</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1943-1951</unitdate><container id="aspace_ca6d2fa04cded9f2d60ead29463d73ae" label="Mixed Materials [10170000016810]" type="Offsite-Box">2562</container><container parent="aspace_ca6d2fa04cded9f2d60ead29463d73ae" type="Folder">12-13</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f3f725f82f266e109fa07bc7a61d4d16" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cover Inventories</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1952-1961</unitdate><container id="aspace_400d754d2d281512780fd964d0a6dfb6" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010582]" type="Offsite-Box">2563</container><container parent="aspace_400d754d2d281512780fd964d0a6dfb6" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_021f1271560e8f33ff8994867d401358" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cover Presentations Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1942-1957</unitdate><container id="aspace_1ef286cbef204f93fcad96f2eaa0a8a0" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010582]" type="Offsite-Box">2563</container><container parent="aspace_1ef286cbef204f93fcad96f2eaa0a8a0" type="Folder">2-14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_984f2f297d234232ea6a401f1097858f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cover Shipments</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1946-1957</unitdate><container id="aspace_87214217ef61dda323db12ec47fdf8cc" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010582]" type="Offsite-Box">2563</container><container parent="aspace_87214217ef61dda323db12ec47fdf8cc" type="Folder">15</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_6b9e2141d7e99b67d297d12d5abc530f" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series II.B.

The stated intent was to comment "[On] the contents of the highbrow magazines of England, France and America..." with the first report entitled "Weekly Reports from the Cultural Front." Constable's purview quickly expanded to include publications from and about other countries. The number of magazines reviewed for content were vast and included <title render="italic">Sight and Sound</title>, <title render="italic">La Table Ronde</title>, <title render="italic">The Kenyon Review</title>, <title render="italic">Horizon</title>, <title render="italic">The Cornhill</title>, <title render="italic">Dublin Review</title> and <title render="italic">Japan Quarterly</title>.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_7f7dff342adb6cf357005c172fdf9b6b"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>The Rosalind Constable Reports include her weekly reports about cultural affairs and the avant-garde art scene as covered by "the little magazines." Constable wrote on theatre, film, literature, poetry, and art, but also philosophy and intellectualism, and strayed at times into the cultural impact of "bloodsports" and business topics. Examples of report titles include "Science Fiction and the French," "Trends in English Poetry," "The New Religion of Art," and "Democracy is Out." Her later reports include lists of selected New York City cultural events. Also included are memoranda regarding reactions to her reports, requests for specific topics, and publishing statistics.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_da33936d5a1c48a83b52b452486dec30"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Organized chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref10_1cv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Reports</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1948-1957</unitdate><container id="aspace_b3cae2d1bb79908b8abcc7c19eb071ad" label="Mixed Materials" type="Offsite-Box">621</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref11_hxr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Reports</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1958-1967</unitdate><container id="aspace_770e9e26d2f4b65118e0427da79e8545" label="Mixed Materials" type="Offsite-Box">622</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_48da54429ff7f833bcb031c06fb5eb0d" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series V.

Examples include "The 'Bull Pen' - Time researchers on a Thursday, before conferences," researchers using "The Morgue" of reference materials, and a photograph of food provided by Time Inc. during a busy period. The scrapbook may contain photographs and biographical information about lesser known staff.</p><p>Some loose papers, including Sugarman's memorandum, found with the scrapbook are in the Associated Papers folder.</p><p>As the scrapbook primarily documents the editorial offices and processes, and seems to have lived in the editorial offices after creation as an editor had it in his possession, it is part of the editorial records instead of the promotional records on the publishing and business side.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_c7bb9c7ddb4e03a0b4e1d7ee040898c3"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Organized by associated papers, pages in numerical order, and binder cover at the end.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_914971a66df2bfb1b5ea91ae3e22da97" level="file"><did><unittitle>Associated Papers</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1937-1963</unitdate><container id="aspace_1997b4589bb11fad7fe667c3df2f1d84" label="Mixed Materials [10170000008326]" type="Offsite-Box">4180</container><container parent="aspace_1997b4589bb11fad7fe667c3df2f1d84" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6c94bf823adfa9b20070305e3d3efcb0" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pages 1-99</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1937 November</unitdate><container id="aspace_54ad8780ff59bd201e35385b38277ae1" label="Mixed Materials [10170000008326]" type="Offsite-Box">4180</container><container parent="aspace_54ad8780ff59bd201e35385b38277ae1" type="Folder">3-7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b5ea66254b1524b3464ae52bf5e70e84" level="file"><did><unittitle>Binder Cover (Life)</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1937 November</unitdate><container id="aspace_12d1c1a2acabd91c0a85f992c1660461" label="Mixed Materials [10170000008326]" type="Offsite-Box">4180</container><container parent="aspace_12d1c1a2acabd91c0a85f992c1660461" type="Folder">1</container></did></c></c></dsc>
