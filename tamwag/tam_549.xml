<p>Steve Zeluck (1922-1985) and Barbara Zeluck (1923-2010) were Trotskyists, and labor union, and occupational health activists. Steve Zeluck was active in the rank and file caucus Chalk Dust, in the United Federation of Teachers (UFT), and also was active in the White Lung Association, a group that advocated for those made ill by their exposure to asbestosis (Zeluck died of mesothelioma). Barbara Zeluck was also involved in socialist feminist actcivity, and in women's health care issues through the Coalition for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse (CARASA). Former members of the Socialist Workers Party, they were also involved in the "Regroupment" efforts of the late 1970s-early 1980s to bring together several Trotskyist organizations. They left the SWP, and were successively involved in the Trotskyist groups International Socialists, Workers Power, and Solidarity.</p><p>Additional biographical information can be found in the following articles:</p><p>"In Memory of Steve Zeluck," by Lew Friedman (<emph render="italic">Against the Current</emph>, number 65, November-December 1996) </p><p><extref ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2316" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="In Memory of Steve Zeluck">http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2316
