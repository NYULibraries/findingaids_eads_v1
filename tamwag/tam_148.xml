            <abstract id="ref2576" label="Abstract">The Church League of America, a right wing anti-communist research and advocacy group, collected these research files from other creators with a similar political outlook and professional activities: American Business Consultants Inc., the Wackenhut Corporation, and Karl Baarslag. All of these creators had connections to the intelligence agencies of the United States government, kept detailed research files on individuals and organizations, and were part of a right-wing research and information network that monitored Communists and other perceived threats to their interpretation of the American way of life.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> By the 1950s, the Wheaton, Illinois-based Church League of America had become a major force in right-wing anti-communist activity, and as other similar organizations faced difficulty, the Church League obtained their research files. American Business Consultants, Inc. was founded in 1947 and was a major force in McCarthy-era investigations into suspected Communist activity. Their for-profit weekly publication 
                <title render="italic">Counterattack</title> and special report 
                <title render="italic">Red Channels</title> provided readers with specific names and information on allegedly subversive individuals and organizations. As a result of the financial difficulties caused by ensuing libel suits, ABC transferred their research files to the Church League. Additional files came from the Wackenhut Corporation, which was founded in 1954 by George R. Wackenhut and other former FBI employees. The company, which provided private security to industry and government agencies, also kept extensive files on individuals, ostensibly to run background checks. The Wackenhut Corporation received many research files from Karl Baarslag who worked for such prominent anti-communists as Senator Joseph McCarthy, Church League of America, and the American Legion. Following the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Wackenhut Corporation transferred many of its research files to the Church League.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> The research files contain newspaper and magazine clippings, reports, flyers, internal and external correspondence, pamphlets, brochures, circulars, and government publications. 
                <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph>'s 1940s-1950s research activities are especially focused on entertainment, unions, suspected Communist Party fronts, foundations and individuals in public life suspected of subversive activities. Many of the Wackenhut documents and a series on student movements in California highlight the suspected connections between Communism, opposition to the Vietnam War, and the broader left counterculture of the 1960s, and document the right's evolving definition of "subversion." The meticulous and thorough collecting activities that led to the creation of these research files makes them a strong source of information on Communists and the left from the 1940s-1970s, and taken as a whole they illustrate the right's interpretation of the political and cultural environment of the mid-twentieth century United States.</abstract>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Church League of America, American Business Consultants, Wackenhut Corporation, and Karl Baarslag profoundly feared the entry of Communism into all aspects of American life. The meticulous and wide-ranging research files that they generated to monitor this real or perceived threat provide a trove of information on the relationship between Communism and numerous individuals, organizations, labor unions, and social movements in the United States during the twentieth century.</p>
            <p>For each creator, the files were a tool for monitoring and making connections between individuals and organizations. To this end, they collected a wide range of published and ephemeral materials including newspaper and magazine clippings, reports, flyers, correspondence, pamphlets and brochures, circulars, and government publications. Names of individuals and organizations in these collected materials were underlined and cataloged for later access, and the majority of the collection is marked with a unique numbering scheme. This scheme was likely begun by ABC, but a similar numbering system was also applied to the materials from the Wackenhut Corporation. While the Church League of America ultimately obtained all of these files to supplement their own similar activities, there are no research files and records determined to be generated by the Church League in this collection.</p>
            <p>Approximately two-thirds of this collection is made up of the research materials gathered by ABC's 
                <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph>. These materials date from the mid-1940s to the early 1950s and were collected from New York-based publications and organizations. The ABC materials also contain a significant amount of internal reports and correspondence, mostly created during the early 1950s and used by the organization for their own reference. There are also indexes throughout the ABC materials which list references to the topics of their research in other parts of the collection or in outside news sources and publications using the aforementioned numbering scheme.</p>
            <p>The Wackenhut Corporation materials have a higher concentration of materials dating from the 1960s through 1970s and document the shifting concerns of the right from strictly Communism to the anti-war movement and left counterculture more broadly. These files are national in scope, but do contain a higher concentration of Florida-based resources and subjects. In addition to research files, the Wackenhut Corporation's materials also include some of their library's administrative files.</p>
            <p>The collection also contains research files related to California student movements and protests, which consist mainly of newspaper clippings, fliers, and both typed and handwritten notes, largely collected in the course of preparing a manuscript on the subject. These materials were collected and generated by an undetermined right-wing organization and reflect their perspective on 1960s student movements.</p>
            <p>The breadth of the creators’ collecting activities gives insight into the extent that the right-wing suspected Communist and left-wing infiltration into American institutions, and taken in full they provide wide-ranging documentation on the political and cultural milieu of the mid-twentieth century United States. The activities that brought about the collection also shine a light on the nature of right wing anti-communist suspicions, the connections between the business and Christian elements in the anti-communist movement, and the connections between private anti-communist organizations and the United States intelligence community.</p>

            <p>The materials in this collection were generated by and passed through a number of hands in the right wing anti-communist network, including private individuals, businesses, and a non-profit before New York University’s Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives obtained them in 1992. The immediate source of acquisition for the materials was Liberty University of Lynchburg, Virginia, which at the time was scaling back their archives due to financial difficulties. They had received the collection from the Church League of America, an anti-communist research and advocacy organization, which had essentially dissolved by 1984. The Church League had received the research files from like-minded organizations operating in similar capacities. The files created by American Business Consultants’ 
                <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> were transferred to the Church League of America as a result of ABC's own financial difficulties and held by the Church League from 1968-1985. Some files generated by former Joseph McCarthy aide Karl Baarslag were variously gifted or sold to the Wackenhut Corporation, who also collected information on individuals’ alleged subversive activities. Following the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Wackenhut drastically reduced the number of its files on individuals, and in 1975 they gave many of their research files to the non-profit Church League of America. Materials in Series IV: Research Files on California Student Movements came into the possession of the Church League of America from an unknown entity.</p>

            <head>Processing Information note</head>
            <p>After 1992, the collection was re-housed, re-foldered, and described by Tamiment archivists. Selected materials were removed to other Tamiment collections. It was re-processed in 2012 to address additional preservation and description needs.</p>
            <p>The series structure and original order of the documents in the collection have largely been maintained. The Subseries VI: Organizations and Subseries IX: Collected Counterattack Series were created from the combinations of multiple American Business Consultants series.</p>
            <p>The folder numbering scheme, which appears to have been created by American Business Consultants, but also applied in a similar form to the documents in the Wackenhut Corporation series, has been maintained as the basis for folder order.</p>
            <p>The materials in this collection have been re-housed into new boxes and folders. Overstuffed folders have been divided into two or more folders. Some individual documents have been moved within folders in order to isolate paper with high acidic content, and acid free paper was interleaved in these cases to separate acidic and non-acidic materials. Empty folders were removed. Original folder titles were retained unless clarification was necessary and additional information was added in brackets. Selected fragile newspaper clippings, acidic paper, and Thermofax copies were photocopied and the original material was removed from the collection.</p>

            <p>The research files of this collection were obtained by the right-wing Church League of America from several prominent anti-communist organizations and individuals: American Business Consultants, Inc. (publishers of 
                <title render="italic">Counterattack</title>), Karl Baarslag, and the Wackenhut Corporation. All of these organizations and individuals had connections to the intelligence agencies of the United States government, kept detailed research files on individuals and organizations as part of their organizational or professional activities, and were a part of a right-wing research and information network that monitored Communists and other perceived threats to their interpretation of the American way of life.</p>
            <p>The Church League of America was founded in Chicago in 1937 to oppose left-wing and Social Gospel influences in Christian thought and organizations. Its first director was Frank J. Loesch, head of the Chicago Crime Commission. The nonprofit organization became an influential anti-communist research and advocacy group in the 1950s, under the direction of former United States Air Force Intelligence Officer Major Edgar C. Bundy. In 1961, the Church League moved its headquarters to Wheaton, Illinois, where it continued its research operations, and created an extensive library of materials on subversive activity. Selling reports and access to its information was a major source of revenue for the Church League, and they also sometimes provided it without charge to like-minded researchers, including members of government and law enforcement agencies. The Church League’s research files also helped it generate materials to spread its anti-communist message through public speaking, books, pamphlets, films, and its newsletter, 
                <title render="italic">News and Views</title>. The Church League of America dissolved in 1984.</p>
            <p>The Church League of America received the research files of fellow anti-communists American Business Consultants, Inc. in 1968, at a time when ABC was undergoing financial difficulties as a result of libel lawsuits. During the McCarthy era, ABC had been a major force in identifying alleged Communists in entertainment, business, and unions. It was founded in 1947 by former FBI employees. The organization actively monitored individuals and organizations, particularly those it suspected were involved with the Communist Party USA. Their weekly publication 
                <title render="italic">Counterattack </title>and special report 
                <title render="italic">Red Channels</title> provided readers with information on allegedly subversive individuals and organizations.</p>
            <p>Another source of the research files, the Wackenhut Corporation, was founded in 1954 by former-FBI employee George R. Wackenhut and other former FBI employees. The company, which provided private security and detective services to industry and government agencies, also kept extensive files on individuals and their political leanings, ostensibly to run background checks. Karl Baarslag, who served in the Office of Naval Intelligence during the Second World War, worked as a professional anti-communist researcher for Senator Joseph McCarthy, the American Legion, and the Church League. He also closely monitored individuals and organizations for potential Communist ties, and ultimately transferred many of his research files to the like-minded Wackenhut Corporation. In 1975, prompted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Wackenhut gave many of its research files to the Church League of America. The Church League was not bound by the legislation, but had a similar political outlook and goals as the Wackenhut Corporation.

                        <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> collected materials on countries, the Communist Party USA, CPUSA Front organizations, trade unions, individuals, organizations, foundations, and other subjects. The research materials are comprised of clippings, reports, flyers, newsletters, circulars, correspondence, and other ephemera.</p>
                    <p>ABC monitored a wide range of publications to gather information for their research files. The materials are made up mostly of clippings, and to a lesser extent ephemeral material generated by the subjects of their investigations. Like-minded individuals often voluntarily provided information on organizations and individuals that were suspected of Communist affiliation through correspondence and typed reports. Interspersed throughout the files are office memoranda exchanged between 
                        <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> staff regarding research activities.</p>
                    <p>The research files were given a numbering scheme for reference and to create indexes and reports. These reports, the bulk of which are found in Subseries VIII, were prepared for internal use and at the request of outside parties. The range of organizations and individuals with files kept by ABC demonstrate their concern with the spread of Communism in the United States.</p>

                    <p>The American Business Consultants, Inc. (ABC) was founded in 1947 by former Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Theodore C. Kirkpatrick, John G. Keenan, and Kenneth M. Bierly. ABC was established as a source of information regarding allegedly subversive organizations and individuals, particularly those suspected of affiliation with the Communist Party USA. The organization was mainly funded by Alfred Kohlberg, a Jewish American businessman and fervent anti-communist who was a member of the John Birch Society and the China Lobby.</p>
                    <p>In May 1947, ABC began publishing a for-profit weekly called 
                        <emph render="italic">Counterattack: The Newsletter of Facts on Communism</emph>. The newsletter, headquartered in New York, sought to "combat communism and those who aid its cause." At its peak, 
                        <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> had a circulation of about 7,500, primarily in New York. Keenan served as 
                        <emph render="italic">Counterattack's </emph> president and devoted much of his time to soliciting subscriptions from business executives and their corporations. Kirkpatrick took on the roles of managing editor and the publication's chief spokesman. Bierly was vice president and shouldered most of the responsibility for overseeing 
                        <emph render="italic">Counterattack's</emph> extensive research department.</p>
                    <p>In June 1950, ABC published a special report called 
                        <emph render="italic">Red Channels</emph>, which listed 151 alleged subversive individuals in the film, radio, and television industries. 
                        <emph render="italic">Red Channels</emph> made the relationship between ABC and the federal government especially apparent, as the publication recorded the number of times an individual had been cited by the FBI, the House on Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and other government agencies. The publication gained notoriety as the "Bible of Madison Avenue," as it was consulted by advertisers and network executives.</p>
                    <p>Many of the film and radio personalities listed in 
                        <emph render="italic">Red Channels</emph> charged ABC with libel suits. Though ABC successfully defended itself or settled out of court, the financial cost of the litigation and the questioning of ABC in the media, from both left and right-wing sources, were damaging to the organization. Of the original ABC founders, only Keenan remained with 
                        <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> after the early 1950s. Bierly departed 
                        <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> in 1951 and became a clearance consultant, working for clients like Columbia Pictures. Kirkpatrick, whose position as the newsletter's spokesman earned him the nickname "Mr. Counterattack," left the publication in 1952 in hopes of running for political office. The newsletter continued to be distributed in the aftermath of the 
                        <emph render="italic">Red Channels</emph> frenzy, but it was understaffed and in financial straits. By the mid-1960s, 
                        <emph render="italic">Counterattack's</emph> circulation had shrunk considerably, and in 1973 publication ceased entirely.</p>

                        <p>This subseries consists primarily of clippings on international political, social and diplomatic developments in the aftermath of World War II, with an emphasis on Communist movements and governments. It especially documents Soviet influence within strategic countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. There are a significant amount of materials on the Soviet Union itself, China, and countries of the Eastern Bloc. In addition to clippings, some files also include memoranda, news service reports, pamphlets, and correspondence, including materials collected from Communist and left organizations.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains the research files of 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> on the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), the bulk of which were collected in the 1940s. ABC was interested in monitoring and understanding the operating procedures the CPUSA, its members, and other organizations they were involved in. ABC used their research to identify Communists in entertainment, business, and unions and implicate individuals and organizations in their publication. The research files consist of clippings, reports, flyers, pamphlets, circulars, internal correspondence, member lists, and other materials collected by 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph>. 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> organized their files by district of the CPUSA and then by subject. Each file contains collected information on districts and groups within the CPUSA. The bulk of the material is New York based. Most districts of the CPUSA are underrepresented or are completely unrepresented in 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph>’s files. District files contain information pertaining to members and activities of the districts. Subject files are divided into cultural and educational activities, organizational policy, minority groups, youth, veterans, and organizational and tactical activities of the CPUSA. The series also contains CPUSA conference proceedings, articles, and other information on the Smith Act trials in 1949.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains mostly research files of 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph>on organizations that 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> viewed as possible Communist Party fronts, the bulk of which were collected in the 1940s. Much of the activity of the Communist Party took place in the context of working within mass organizations; those established by the Party were often referred to as front organizations. Mass organizations were usually devoted to a single issue or constituency and had a broader membership and political appeal than that of the official Party line. Some organizations within this series were known fronts, others were suspected fronts by ABC. The materials in this subseries afford a perspective of both anti-Communist efforts to expose front organizations as well as the leftist political agenda of these alleged fronts in terms of postwar domestic and foreign policy.</p>
                        <p>These organizations are mostly left organizations, including peace movements, political action and labor committees, progressive and civil rights groups, student organizations, schools and universities, and anti-fascist groups, including the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and other Spanish solidarity groups. The series also features multiple Communist country solidarity groups, including the National Council for American-Soviet Friendship. Documentation within each file is essentially an accumulation of information relating to certain suspected front organizations. Materials in the collection generally consist of newspaper clippings relating to the front's activities; pamphlets and other materials published by the front organization; leaflets, programs, and announcements of front rallies, meetings, and functions; and membership lists of fronts, including names and addresses. 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack </emph> gathered any information they could to build a case and prove that they were Communist affiliated. There are some correspondence between organization and the editors of 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph>, in response to Communist accusations.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains the research files of 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> on trade unions suspected of being controlled or influenced by Communists. The majority of the materials come from between 1946 and 1949, and reflect attacks on Communism in unions and the attempts of union leaders to defend themselves, as well as simple documentation of union actions.</p>
                        <p>
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> acquired any information they could to build a case against a trade union and accuse them of having Communist sympathies in their publication or in their reports. They acquired information often through the use of mailing lists or through an informant. Files contain clippings, circulars, flyers, pamphlets, meeting minutes, membership lists, convention proceedings, and other material created by unions. The series also contains reports and internal correspondence created by 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> informants within the unions and the 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> research department. Most files are on American trade unions, many affiliated with the CIO and the AFL. Industries represented by the unions include manufacturing, entertainment, electrical, machine, retail, marine, textile, and service industries. This series also contains files on the Taft-Hartley Bill. There is a fair amount of material on union in-fighting over Communist sympathy. National unions are more widely represented. Most represented locals are based in New York.</p>

                        <p>This series contains the research files of 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> on specific individuals, both well-known and lesser-known, many of whom ABC suspected of having Communist affiliations. Some of the individuals highlighted by 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack </emph>are recognized in the film and television industry or known for their work as musicians, authors, politicians, religious leaders, political activists, newscasters, labor leaders, Communist Party leaders, or academics. The research files primarily consist of newspaper and magazine clippings, usually with names underlined or otherwise annotated, and 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack’s</emph> internal reports on alleged Communists (though there are also some reports 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> prepared for outside parties). This series is also comprised of 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack’s </emph>internal correspondence, as well as collected flyers, pamphlets, publications, and circulars, including materials created by the Communist Party.</p>
                        <p>To a much lesser extent, this series contains letters written to Theodore C. Kirkpatrick, 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph>’s managing editor, often with requests to research specific individuals. There are also several indexes which list references to individuals in other series of the 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> research files in this collection. Some of the indexes include references to the listed individuals in left-wing publications like 
                            <emph render="italic">The Daily Worker</emph> or 
                            <emph render="italic">Soviet Russia Today,</emph> in New York-based news sources such as the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> and the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Herald Tribune</emph>, or in the reports on suspected subversive individuals compiled by Senator Jack B. Tenney, the chairman of the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities. Other indexes include references to the individuals in this series in Appendix IX, a seven-volume compilation of names of people who participated in alleged Communist front organizations between 1930 and 1944, prepared for the House Un-American Activities Commission by J.B. Matthews and Benjamin Mandel. Some of the internal reports within this series are duplicated in Subseries VIII.</p>

                        <p>Subseries V originally consisted of two series, "Individuals Miscellaneous" and "Individuals Named." These series have been merged into one "Individuals" subseries by the archivists. Folders labeled "Miscellaneous Individuals," which contained hundreds of names, have been divided into many smaller folders. The archivists also added names to folder titles for folders originally labeled "Miscellaneous Individuals." This added description is indicated with square brackets. The names included in the folder titles were highlighted by ABC through underlining or other annotations. Names listed in the folder titles reflect the names which are repeated or most prevalent within the folders, but not every name within each folder is included in the folder titles.</p>

                        <p>This series consists of files kept on foundations for the purposes of monitoring officers and staff, areas and amounts of giving and grant recipients to identify relationships among foundations and suspected Communists and front organizations. There is an emphasis on educational institutions, as well as labor leaders, journalists, writers, and artists receiving direct or indirect support from foundations.</p>
                        <p>Files include typed profiles of foundations, press coverage on foundation initiatives, and foundation publications. The series also contains several files of individual and foundation profiles which cross reference other

                        <p>This subseries mostly contains prepared reports created by 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph> on individuals, unions, and other organizations, the bulk of which were created in the late 1940s and 1950s. These reports consist of information on activities and biographical and historical information on individuals and organizations that were considered Communist or sympathetic to Communists. These reports were a compilation of information that they collected, typed and often marked with one of the editors’ initials in the corner of the report. The reports referenced any left-wing or Communist-linked activity of the individuals or organizations. Often these reports were created for people outside of ABC.</p>
                        <p>In addition to reports, reference requests toward 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack</emph>’s research department are included; they consist of an internal reference sheet and handwritten notes on the researched individual. Indexes are also found in the series; cross-referencing individuals and organizations found in earlier series. Some of the indexes include references to the listed individuals in left-wing publications like
                            <emph render="italic"> The Daily Worker </emph>or 
                            <emph render="italic">Soviet Russia Today,</emph> in New York-based news source such as the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> and the 
                            <emph render="italic">New York Herald Tribune</emph>, or in the reports on suspected subversive individuals compiled by Senator Jack B. Tenney, the chairman of the California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities. Other indexes include references to the individuals in this series in Appendix IX. Some of the internal reports within this series are duplicated in Series V. 
                            <emph render="italic">Counterattack’s </emph>numbering scheme is maintained on earlier series to aid cross-referencing. Some of these individuals and organizational reports are duplicates that appear in different series within the collection.</p>

                    <p>This series contains research files and records of the Wackenhut Corporation which came into the custody of the Church League of America. They are a mixture of research files, correspondence, and administrative files for Wackenhut’s library. Wackenhut's fastidious documentation of the activities of individuals and organizations make these files a strong source for information on players in Communist and left-wing politics in the 1950s-1970s.</p>
                    <p>The research files are a mixture of clippings, essays, pamphlets, and other materials organized and frequently marked up by Wackenhut. Many of the research files were originally collected by former Joseph McCarthy aide Karl Baarslag and sold or gifted to Wackenhut. While the corporation’s primary concern was monitoring the activities of Communist and left-leaning individuals and organizations, they collected materials from anyone engaged in the civic dialogue, including right-wing fringe groups. Taken as a whole, the files give insight into the range of activities that these right-wing anti-communists viewed as potential threats to stability in American society. The first 27 folders of the series, Subversive Activities, contain materials similar to the rest of the series, with a higher content of correspondence (much of it with Federal intelligence agencies), and research files on Vietnam War protests, espionage, and anti-communist efforts in Florida. These folders, and the series more broadly, point to the real and perceived connections between Communism, the anti-war movement, and the broader left counterculture of the 1960s, and document the right's evolving definition of "subversion."</p>
                    <p>Interspersed with the research files are administrative files for the Wackenhut Corporation’s library. Many of these files are correspondence with publications, mostly dating from 1966-1967. Most of the subscriptions were obtained using the aliases Carol Ascher and William Jones. Like the research files, the publications reflect the full spectrum of political viewpoints of the period and document the range of actors attempting to shape American society during this turbulent period. The publications themselves generally are not included in the files.</p>

                    <p>The Wackenhut Corporation was founded in 1954 by three former FBI men, including George R. Wackenhut. By the 1960s, the Coral Gables, Florida-based corporation was the third largest detective agency in the country. Wackenhut received numerous government contracts, both state and federal, and counted the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as two of its largest customers. By the 1980s much of their business was in administering prison security.</p>
                    <p>The Wackenhut Corporation actively collected information on individuals, both to run background checks for their clients and as an outgrowth of George Wackenhut’s anti-communist views. By 1971 the company had files on 2.5 million individuals. In response to the passage of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the company reduced the number to between 225,000 and 250,000 files. In 1975 they gave many of their files to the Church League of America, which was not bound by the disclosure requirements of the law. As a part of its anti-communist security activities, Wackenhut also published a monthly newsletter called

                    <p>This series contains research files collected by Karl Baarslag, primarily between the 1930s and the mid-1960s, on organizations and issues he was monitoring for his work as a consultant and government employee. The files include materials collected on and from a wide variety of organizations, including nongovernmental, faith-based, civil rights and foreign policy organizations, trade unions, foundations, governmental agencies, news organizations, journals, anti-communist and right-wing organizations, and far right-wing organizations.</p>
                    <p>The files include organizational newsletters, brochures, annual reports and circulars, apparently collected by Baarslag through subscriptions. There are also government publications, newspaper, magazine and journal clippings, anonymously authored confidential reports and typed profiles on organizations, and a relatively small amount of correspondence. Some files contain research materials apparently collected by Baarslag in the early 1950s during his tenure as research assistant for Senator Joseph McCarthy's Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.</p>

                    <p>Karl Herman William Baarslag was an author and professional anti-communist who served as research director under Senator Joseph McCarthy between July 1953 and 1954 for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and as a consultant for the House Committee on Un-American Activities beginning in 1956. Prior to joining McCarthy’s subcommittee, Baarslag was Research Director for the National Americanism Commission of the American Legion, an anti-communist organization, and edited their newsletter,

                    <p>This series contains research files collected by an undetermined creator regarding student movements and protests in California. Many of the files appear to have been collected to write a manuscript on events at the University of California, Berkeley. A draft of this untitled 1967 manuscript is included. Also present are clippings, typed summaries of news articles, fliers, posters, typed notes on radio and television broadcasts, internal reports, and index cards.</p>
                    <p>The majority of the files document student activities at University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco State College. Subjects included in the files are student strikes, university building occupation, Vietnam War protests, sexual politics on campus, the Black Panthers and Black Power, the curriculum, Free Speech Movement, Students for a Democratic Society, and Community for New Politics. These files provide a right wing interpretation of student movements in the 1960s and also show the real or perceived links that the right wing tracked between the peace movement, student activism, the Communist Party USA, and other radical left wing groups.</p>
