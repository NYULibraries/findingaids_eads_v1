The event included speeches, meetings, tours of other cities in the Soviet Union, and tours of factories, schools, and hospitals. Upon her return to the United States, Williams and other WILPF members were interviewed by the FBI to describe their trip and their interactions with Russians. The Abbie Louise Bosworth Williams Collection on the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom consist of materials documenting Abbie Louise Bosworth Williams's 1963 trip to the Soviet Union with the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Materials include a handwritten journal (and a typed copy), maps and tourist brochures from the Soviet Union, a detailed itinerary, and notes that highlight her point of view. In addition to documenting the specific 1963 Congress, the materials in this collection more broadly documents the types of activities undertaken by the WILPF in the mid-20th century. The maps and tourist brochures of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic (also known as East Germany) reflect the ways in which these countries sought to depict themselves to foreign audiences.</abstract>
