            <p>John Butler Snook (1815-1901) was born in England, and came to the United States as a child. His career as a practicing architect in New York City spanned nearly 60 years. He was educated as a carpenter, serving as an apprentice in his father's carpentry business, and was largely self-taught as an architect. In 1842 he joined the firm of Joseph Trench, and in less than five years he became the junior partner in the firm.</p>
            <p>While associated with Trench, Snook designed the A. T. Stewart department store on lower Broadway, the first luxury dry-goods store in America, and the Metropolitan and St. Nicholas Hotels. After Trench moved west to San Francisco, Snook continued to work in New York City until the end of the century, focusing mainly on projects in the city, but also designing and constructing buildings in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Westchester County, and New Jersey.</p>
            <p>Snook designed churches, hotels, residences, train depots, warehouses, tenements, and hospitals. While he did not specialize in one type of building, the majority of his work was in warehouses, commercial buildings, and tenements. In 1869, Cornelius Vanderbilt employed Snook to design the first Grand Central Depot, which was intended to serve as the main passenger terminal for the New York and Harlem Railroad and the New York Central and Hudson Railroad.</p>
            <p>In 1836 Snook married Maria A. Weekes, with whom he had nine children that lived to adulthood. Three of these, James H., Samuel B., and Edward T., eventually joined his practice, which was renamed John B. Snook &amp; Sons. One of Snook's sons-in-law, John W. Boylston, also worked in the firm. Snook died at his home in Brooklyn in 1901.</p>

            <p>The John B. Snook Architectural Records Collection spans the period from 1843 to 1948 and contains architectural drawings and record books from John Butler Snook and his descendents' careers as architects in New York City. The collection is divided into two series: Architectural Drawings and Record Books.</p>

            <p>Architectural drawings were arranged by size and then given project numbers. Most drawings are rolled and stored in boxes but a few have been flattened and are stored in folders. Projects are listed by client name, if known, and then by project name and address.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>Series I. Architectural Drawings contains a total of 2,719 drawings representing 225 different projects. Drawings include elevations, plans, sections, mechanical and engineering drawings, blueprints, working drawings, and presentation drawings. The majority of the projects found here are buildings in New York City and surrounding boroughs and towns. Most projects represented are generally those from later in Snook's career. A few projects date from the time of John Snook Sons, the firm's name after Snook's death. Snook's design for the original Grand Central Terminal is only represented here by one large elevation, probably a presentation drawing.</p>
                    <p>Projects are arranged by size of drawing, and are numbered accordingly for easy reference. The numbers were assigned by the N-YHS staff and do not reflect any intention on the part of the architect. All drawings for the same project are rolled together, unless some of the drawings required flat storage. A list of projects by geographical location, and by date, follow this finding aid.</p>
                    <p>The architectural drawings were surveyed and inventoried in the summer of 2004. Those that could not be unrolled were humidified and flattened. Remaining rolled drawings are extremely fragile and may need conservation before being viewed. Please contact the Print Room staff at least one week before anticipated visit. Also, the collection was not processed per se, as there remains a great deal of research to be done on each building.</p>
