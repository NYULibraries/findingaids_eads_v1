    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Two digital exhibits created to highlight New York University Archives and the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archive's holdings.</p><p>The first exhibit relates to the Jewish Labor Committee's resistance of the Nazi party in Germany and the Holocaust and their political efforts following World War II.  The digital exhibit features historical overviews with images and captions on the origins of the Jewish Labor Committee, the JLC's anti-Nazi activity in the 1930s, their Rescue efforts through the late thirties and early forties, the Jewish response to the second world war and the Holocaust, postwar aid and reconstruction, an adoption program for displaced Jewish children following the war, and the JLC's post-war political activity.</p><p>The second exhibit features the Special Collections' photographic holdings by Sam Reiss, who photographed events related to national labor activism including union meetings, marches, and strikes.  The exhibit allows users to navigate selected photographs (with descriptions) by year from 1948-1975 or by subject, including Education, Housing, Medical/Scientific, Personalities, At Work, Poverty, Demonstrations &amp; Rallies, Children, Labor Unions and Organizations, Pro-Isreal and Antisemitism, and Civil Rights.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>These two exhibits were created in circa 1997 to highlight two of the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives/Tamiment Library holdings, the Jewish Labor Committee Records and the Sam Reiss Photographs. The Jewish Labor Committee exhibit, "Labor and the Holocaust: The Jewish Labor Committee and the Anti-Nazi Struggle" was adapted from an article by Gail Malmgreen originally published in Labor's Heritage (October 1991). </p><p>"Sam Reiss: Eyewitness to Labor History" displays images from the Sam Reiss 1975 retrospective exhibit hosted by Metropolitan Labor Press Council and District Council 37 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME).</p>  </bioghist>
