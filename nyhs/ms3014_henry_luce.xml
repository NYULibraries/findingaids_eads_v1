            <p>Henry R. Luce (hereafter HRL) directed that all his files before 1933 be thrown out when his new secretary, Corinne Thrasher, arrived and found them unmanageable, leaving a relatively small number of records in his papers prior to the 1930s. Upon his death in 1967, HRL’s remaining files and those of his personal assistants were reviewed item by item and divided into records classified as personal and business. Records classified as business became part of the Time Inc. archives while those considered personal became part of the Henry R. Luce papers. In the initial division the personal papers included correspondence pertaining to HRL’s outside interests and activities, family correspondence and personal correspondence with outsiders, as well as photographs and financial records. Some of his files during the division were given to the Library of Congress with copies of the more prominent records retained in his papers. The arrangement of the papers was partially determined by the needs of Robert Elson who was given the task of writing a corporate history of Time Inc. Between 1967 and early 2000s additional materials were added to the collection.</p>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Henry Robinson Luce (hereafter HRL) was born on 3 April 1898 in Tengchow (currently Penglai), China to Presbyterian missionaries Reverend Dr. Henry Winters Luce (1868-1941) and Elizabeth Middleton Luce (1870-1948). HRL spent the first 14 years of his life in China, apart from a visit to the United States in 1906-1907. He attended Chefoo School, a British run preparatory institution in northern China. In 1912, when he was 14, HRL travelled to England to briefly study in St. Albans School, before returning to the U.S. and entering the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut the following year.</p>
            <p>In 1916 HRL began attending Yale University where he served as managing editor of the Yale 
                <emph render="italic">Daily News</emph> and actively contributed to other university publications. A member of the Yale ROTC Field Artillery Unit, he left college to train army recruits during World War I and was discharged as Second Lieutenant at the end of 1918. Returning to Yale, he graduated in 1920.</p>
            <p>Following graduation, HRL spent a year studying history at Oxford University, coming back to the United States in 1921 to take a job as a cub reporter at the Chicago 
                <emph render="italic">Daily News</emph> and then the Baltimore 
                <emph render="italic">News</emph>. HRL quit his job in 1922 to concentrate on the creation of a "news-magazine" with Briton Hadden, a classmate from Hotchkiss and Yale. Together they formed the company Time Incorporated (later changed to Time Inc.) and published the first issue of their magazine, TIME, in New York in 1923.</p>
            <p>On 22 December 1923 HRL married Lila Ross Hotz (1899-1999), the couple having two sons: Henry Luce III in 1925 and Peter Paul Luce in 1928. After briefly moving to live in Cleveland, Ohio in 1925, along with the publishing operations of TIME, HRL moved back to New York in 1927. Following Hadden’s death in 1929, HRL became the sole head of Time Inc., launching additional ventures throughout the 1930s, including FORTUNE in 1930, THE MARCH OF TIME radio series in 1931 (and short film series in 1935), and LIFE in 1936. HRL divorced Lila Hotz in 1935, marrying Clare Boothe Brokaw (1903-1987), a playwright and former managing editor of 
                <emph render="italic">Vanity Fair</emph>, the same year.</p>
            <p>As a prominent publisher, HRL corresponded with a large number of individuals, including politicians, educators, and businessmen. He traveled extensively, both nationally and internationally, and was frequently invited to speak before professional, academic and church groups. In the early years of World War II, as a member of the Century Group, HRL advocated providing assistance to Great Britain, envisioning an expanded global role for the United States after the conclusion of the war. His vision was laid out in his best known article “The American Century,” published in LIFE in 1941.</p>
            <p>HRL’s increasing interest in politics and world affairs led to his involvement in the 1940 presidential campaign where he served as one of the driving forces promoting the candidacy of Wendell Willkie, the Republican running against Franklin D. Roosevelt. He also led a concerted campaign to provide aid to China under the aegis of the United China Relief. After the war, HRL travelled extensively throughout Europe, Asia and the Middle East, advocating a tough stance against Communism. As a potent force in the Republican Party, HRL and his wife were early supporters of Dwight D. Eisenhower’s candidacy for the presidency in 1952 and after the election, Clare Boothe Luce was appointed ambassador to Italy. As a result, HRL opened an office in Rome, splitting his time between Italy and the United States from 1953-1956. In 1954 he launched SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.</p>
            <p>Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, in addition to his work at Time Inc, HRL was continuously involved in various charities related to the Presbyterian Church, Yale, and China, in addition to being a director, trustee, member, and sponsor of a large number of organizations. Becoming convinced that peace in the world could only be achieved by following the rule of law, he became a strong advocate for that concept. After marking the 40th anniversary of TIME in 1963, he retired from Time Inc. the following year. HRL continued to lecture and travel, as well as staying up-to-date with matters related to Time Inc. after his retirement until his death on 28 February 1967 in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of files related to the life and legacy of Henry R. Luce (hereafter HRL) and includes correspondence and memoranda regarding awards given to HRL; updated drafts of his biography; letters marking his retirement from Time Inc. and letters of condolences following his death; reel recordings of HRL's speeches, interviews and the memorial services; remembrances and anecdotes of HRL from his coworkers and friends; calendar pages with his daily schedules; copies of financial ledgers; handwritten notes taken from HRL's desk; and various commemorative projects following his death, including a postage stamp and an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
                    <p>The largest group of biographical files consists of HRL’s trip files and includes internal correspondence and memoranda dealing with trip preparations; preliminary and final versions of itineraries and schedules; invitations to attend events while traveling and his responses; correspondence sent while traveling; letters of introduction; lists of individuals met while traveling and lists of individuals he expected to see, along with biographical information on them; and printed materials picked up while traveling, including guides, maps, and newspapers. There are also notes and reports giving HRL’s impressions of the places visited, the political climate there, and his thoughts on the individuals met. Frequently these were sent to Time Inc. editors and officers for possible incorporation into articles. In addition, there are also notes and summaries from meetings with prominent individuals during his travels, including Charles de Gaulle and Clement Attlee.</p>
                    <p>Miscellaneous files contain mostly copies of correspondence and memoranda assembled by year that deal with a wide variety of topics including management of LIFE, HRL's potential run for the Senate, and lobbying efforts by the Century Group to provide Great Britain with old U.S. destroyers during World War II. There are also additional organizational and subject files attached to the series that are similar to other such files found throughout the series with correspondence, memoranda, and printed materials with or about organizations in which HRL was involved as a sponsor or beneficiary, served on a committee or council, and was a trustee or board member. In addition these files contain correspondence, memoranda, background and research materials pertaining to HRL’s outside interests and activities including China and the rule of law.</p>

                        <p>The subseries includes correspondence inviting HRL to speak or submit an article for publication; his responses and internal memoranda discussing what actions he should take; planning and scheduling the trip to give the speech; invitations to meet individuals unrelated to the speech located in the area to be visited; background and biographical information on individuals and organizations inviting HRL, on those attending the event, those he may meet, and information on employees working in the Time Inc. regional offices; background on the venue and events where he is scheduled to speak; arrangements for where he will be staying, and detailed itineraries.</p>
                        <p>In addition there are a large number of heavily marked early and later drafts of speeches and articles, as well as the final versions; handwritten notes; speech outlines; reference and research materials assembled to assist the writing process or to be incorporated into the article or speech; internal memoranda requesting the opinions of Time Inc. staff and their responses, comments and advice. The internal memoranda and correspondence involving logistical planning, fact checking, and advice given to HRL is sent to and received from his secretary, Corinne Thrasher, and a number of personal assistants and Time Inc. officers including Allen Grover, Russell Bourne, Emeline Nollen, C.D. Jackson, Albert L. Furth, Wes Bailey, Bernard Barnes, and John Jessup.</p>
                        <p>There are also brochures, programs, promotional materials, press releases and other printed materials from the events where HRL made the speech or that were published by the group which invited him; and responses and reactions from attendees, Time Inc. staff and members of the public who read the speech or article. Some of the speeches were sent to prominent individuals and the files include responses from professors, clergy, deans, college presidents, businessmen, publishers and editors. In addition there are letters of gratitude; requests for copies of the speech; logistics dealing with publication and distribution of speeches; mailing lists for speech distribution; and reports of a selection of comments generated by a speech or article.</p>
                        <p>The contents of any one speech file tends to vary substantially with some containing very little materials compared to others. Of note in the subseries are drafts of speeches made by HRL in late 1940-early 1941 which became the basis for his "The American Century" article in LIFE.</p>

                    <p>The series consists of memoranda and correspondence which highlight the development and prominent episodes in the lives of Henry R. Luce (hereafter HRL), Time Inc., and of its various publications. The documents illustrate HRL’s thinking and beliefs, as well as his relationships and interactions with Time Inc. staff and individuals outside of the company. This material appears to have been assembled as part of the research for the corporate history of Time Inc: 
                        <emph render="italic">Time Inc: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1923-1941</emph> (published in 1968); 
                        <emph render="italic">The World of Time Inc: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1941-1960</emph> (published in 1973); and the beginning of 
                        <emph render="italic">The World of Time Inc: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1960-1980</emph> (published in 1986). Many of the documents found in the series are quoted from, referenced to, or used for background information throughout these books.</p>
                    <p>The contents consist mainly of multiple carbon copies (some annotated), with a lesser number of originals and copies; some are labeled “confidential” and “strictly confidential.” Most were written and sent out by HRL (some have “not sent” written at the top) to the entire staff of Time Inc., staff of individual magazines, to groups and to individual editors and officers as well as to individuals outside of Time Inc. The latter include Winston Churchill, John F. Kennedy, and to other individuals where HRL is responding to complaints, and explaining his thinking on such subjects as "The American Century."</p>
                    <p>The Time Inc. staff members the memoranda are addressed to include MacLeish, Grover, Hobson, Wertenbaker, Billings, Larsen, Prentice, Jessup, Gottfried, Jackson, J. Davenport, Furth, Roy Alexander, Hedley Donovan, Thompson, Heiskell, Linel, and Paine. TIME, LIFE, FORTUNE, and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED are the main publications discussed in the memoranda. TIME International, LIFE International, LIFE Spanish, ARCHITECTURAL FORUM, and HOUSE &amp; GARDEN are sometimes, though infrequently mentioned.</p>
                    <p>Records include early prospectus drafts for LIFE, THE MARCH OF TIME film series, and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, as well as periodical reformulations termed a “re-thinking" and a “respectus” which serve to update the original formula of the magazines. Memoranda covers a wide variety of subjects, including managerial appointments and personnel decisions; policy decisions, fundamental attitudes, convictions and responsibilities of Time Inc; responses to controversies in the pages of its publications; editorial and promotional strategy; and questions of budgeting, advertising, and circulation.</p>
                    <p>In addition, a large number of memoranda sent by HRL contains his general thought and ideas directed at his editors and officers for discussion purposes and consists of his comments on current events; gives ideas for possible TIME covers; elaborates on major themes and subjects that he would like to be covered by Time Inc. publications; gives editorial ideas; discusses articles he is working on; and positions he believes the publications should take. Frequently memoranda contain HRL’s criticisms, evaluations, comments and suggestions on individual articles and entire issues of Time Inc. publications.</p>

                        <p>The majority of the documents in the subseries appear to be mainly related to Time Inc., its publications, and the subject of publishing in general. In some cases the subjects of the files are submitting an article, are being solicited to submit a manuscript or are themselves the subjects of an article being written by someone else.</p>
                        <p>Materials related to Time Inc. publications consist of correspondence dealing with complaints from individuals on behalf of themselves or the organizations they work for or represent; compliments and encouragements after reading an article; letters of gratitude for being mentioned in a publication, appearing on the cover, or for receiving favorable coverage; article suggestions; requests for reprints and images that have appeared in the publications; proposals for new magazines and other publications; letters of gratitude for receiving Time Inc. publications, speech reprints or other gifts sent by Henry R. Luce (hereafter HRL); and correspondence giving the sender's general opinion, suggestion and advice.</p>
                        <p>There are also carbon copies of responses from HRL and other Time Inc. staff; internal memoranda dealing with the investigation of complaints received, suggestions and advice on how HRL should respond, and drafts of responses to the individual making the complaint; discussion memoranda on how the subject individual will be covered in an upcoming story; correspondence and memoranda discussing payments for articles; and internal memos to HRL from Time Inc. staff giving him summaries of conversations they had with various individuals.</p>
                        <p>There is also correspondence to HRL where the subject individuals are giving their general opinion on a variety of topics including economics, politics, foreign affairs, as well as apprising HRL of interesting things they have discovered and updating him of the news from where they are; asking for his endorsements for projects they are working on or his support or sponsorship of an initiative or issue they are working on; requests for jobs at Time Inc. and letters of recommendations; and letters forwarding various publications, clippings, essays, and article drafts for HRL's information and opinion.</p>
                        <p>In addition there are HRL’s letters of congratulations to other publications marking their anniversaries; memoranda dealing with dinner arrangements with biographical sketches of individuals to be present; requests for meetings and appointments, and arrangements to be made; a large number of letters of gratitude and other responses to invitations to attend the 40th anniversary of TIME in 1963; invitations to speak; letters of condolences following HRL’s death with acknowledgements; and clippings on subjects added to their files after HRL’s death.</p>
                        <p>There are a number of files in the subseries on HRL's family members, including his father, mother, sisters, and youngest son with photographs, correspondence, printed materials, and background information. There is also a file on HRL himself with excerpts from family correspondence. (See also series IV.)</p>

                    <p>Allen Grover was born about 1901 in St. Louis, MO. He graduated from Yale University in 1922. Grover began as a contributing editor for business and finance at TIME in 1931, transferring to FORTUNE the following year, eventually rising to assistant managing editor. In 1936 he became HRL's personal assistant and in 1939 was promoted to vice president. He retired in 1962.</p>
                    <p>(The above note was based on Grover's

                    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                    <p>The series includes the records of Allen Grover’s activities managing the personal affairs of Henry R. Luce (hereafter HRL), Clare Boothe Luce, and other members of the Luce family, as well as Grover’s management of matters related to Time Inc. in his capacity as a senior member of the staff. These deal with personal finances, real estate, and artworks; and personnel, management, publications, and other Time Inc. related matters.</p>
                    <p>A large part of the series consists of correspondence and memoranda exchanged between Grover, HRL, and HRL’s secretary, Corinne Thrasher. These include Grover’s notifications of actions taken; description of actions needed to be taken; requests for approval; giving his impressions, advice, opinion, analysis, and recommendations; reporting on meetings attended and people met; making arrangements for trips, meetings, dinners, and other plans; apprising HRL of recent developments and giving personal and Time Inc. updates while HRL is traveling; requesting instructions; and detailing the results of investigations and research undertaken on HRL’s behalf.</p>
                    <p>The files include letters written on behalf of HRL and drafts of correspondence for HRL’s signature; letters of acknowledgement; requisitions for expense reimbursement on behalf of HRL from Time Inc.; background materials assembled by Grover; correspondence with other members of Time Inc. staff; and responses to letters of complaint. In addition there is original correspondence from third parties forwarded to Grover for answers on behalf of HRL, including invitations, requests for meetings, letters of appreciation, request for financial contributions and the use of HRL’s name; original correspondence sent to Grover in his capacity as a senior Time Inc. staff member; and other correspondence and memoranda on which he was copied or that was forwarded to him for information. Some of the correspondence was sent by HRL while he was living in Rome. Some of the original memos originally written by Grover are in the files, having been returned to him with HRL’s decisions and notes.</p>

                        <p>The subseries consists mostly of documents dealing with various aspects of Clare Boothe Luce’s (hereafter CBL) finances encompassing her bank accounts, investments in securities, organizations, and the theatre, including the play "Arsenic and Old Lace"; payment of royalties received for her books, articles, and plays, including “The Women” and “Kiss the Boys Goodbye”; international publication rights; correspondence with financial advisors, brokers, managers, bank personnel, and Allen Grover; memoranda discussing her finances and giving advice; materials related to state and federal income taxes; insurance for real estate, jewelry and other valuables; annual meeting notices for investors; invoices; cancelled checks; audits, account summaries, monthly and quarterly financial statements, balance sheets, estimated expenses and income, proposed yearly budgets, and other financial reports.</p>
                        <p>In addition there are a large number of solicitation letters requesting CBL provide financial assistance for charitable causes, appear at fundraisers, and become a member of organizations. These also include follow-up letters, letters of acknowledgements, letters of gratitude, receipts, lists of charitable contributions made; membership cards, and a small number of photographs.</p>
                        <p>There are also notes, correspondence, and memoranda from Dorothea Philp and Isabel Hill, CBL’s assistant and secretary, unrelated to her finances and which include telephone messages, letter drafts, itineraries, logistical memoranda, instructions, event updates, and arrangement for transportation. In addition there is a small amount of correspondence from HRL. Materials unrelated to CBL's finances are usually filed within the "Luce, Mrs. Henry R. (Clare)" file.</p>
