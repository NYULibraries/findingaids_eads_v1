            <p>Virginia Gardner (1904-1992) was a journalist, a communist, and biographer of Louise Bryant. She was raised in Fort Smith, Arkansas graduated with a B.A. in journalism from the University of Missouri in 1924, then worked at several Midwestern newspapers before joining the 
                <title render="italic" type="simple">Chicago Tribune</title>in 1930. Gardner gradually became a radical, joined the Communist Party c.1937, led the small Newspaper Guild group at the 
                <title render="italic" type="simple">Tribune</title>, and was fired for her union activism in March, 1940.</p>
            <p>Blacklisted in Chicago, she moved to New York where she worked with the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee. After her divorce from journalist Marion (Red) Marberry, Gardner moved to Washington, DC in 1942, and was briefly Executive Secretary of the American Council on Soviet Relations. Between 1940 and 1942 Virginia Gardner was active as a member of the Citizens Committee for Harry Bridges, serving as its Executive Secretary in 1941. From 1942-1943 she worked for the Federated Press (a labor news service), resigning over its unwillingness to criticize John L. Lewis. Gardner next worked for the 
                <title render="italic" type="simple">New Masses</title>, resigning in 1947 when it became a monthly.</p>
            <p>She moved to Los Angeles, working for the 
                <title render="italic" type="simple">Peoples World</title>(the CPUSA West Coast newspaper) until her dismissal in 1951, and was then briefly employed at a meat packing plant. In 1952 Gardner moved to New York where, again, her first job was at a meat plant in Jamaica, Queens, before being employed by the 
                <title render="italic" type="simple">Daily Worker</title>where she covered the Rosenberg case in 1953, and later wrote The Rosenberg Story, which was published in 1954. In 1959 Virginia Gardner left the 
                <title render="italic" type="simple">Worker</title>, and between 1960 and 1962 worked as a medical writer. From 1963 to 1971 she worked as editorial assistant to Corliss Lamont. Her Louise Bryant biography was published in 1982. Soon afterwards she began working on her own autobiography. Gardner died in San Diego on January 5th, 1992.</p>

            <p>Series I. Autobiography contains a lengthy and rather personal unpublished untitled autobiographical typescript, related correspondence, and a genealogy and other biographical materials.</p>
            <p>Series II. Correspondence is divided into personal (family and friends) and political correspondence and spans the years 1922 to 1990. Personal correspondents include her son John Marberry, her nephew John Gardner, several friends, and boyfriends Brady Pryor, Dud Jarret, Paul Cawthron, Andy Anderson, John McShane, and Milt Rogart and his wife. The political correspondence is with communists, other radicals and several well-known writers, including Bill Allen, Sender A. Garlin, Ammon Hennacy, Corrine Hardesty, Corliss Lamont, Kay Hall Sessions, Frank Spector, John Tessitore, Nick Unger, Harry and Nikki Bridges and William Appleman Williams.</p>
            <p>Series III. Political Activities, is divided into two sections: A. General, which contains files on the Rosenberg case, the American Council on Soviet Relations, and Gardner's testimony before various legislative committees; and B. The Harry Bridges Case, which contains clippings, correspondence between Gardner and Harry and Nikki Bridges, and Citizens Committee for Harry Bridges materials related to the campaign to prevent his deportation from the United States.</p>
            <p>Series IV. Journalism Career, consists of five chronologically arranged subseries that represent the different newspapers and the various cities in which she lived and worked, and which primarily contain copies of Gardner's articles, and correspondence.

Contents include clippings, correspondence and interviews with prominent friends and associates, ephemera, primary source documents including a copy of Bryant's marriage license (to John Reed), and a typescript of the book.
