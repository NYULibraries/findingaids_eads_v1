    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The George Zlobin photograph collection contains 16 items dating from circa 1920 to 1940. Included in the collection are 15 black-and-white photographic prints of New York City related images and one black-and-white copy print of a rendering of the Brooklyn Bridge showing cars, delivery trucks, and pedestrians crossing the bridge heading towards Manhattan. The delineator of the rendering is C.A. Schultz. The photographic prints include several images of the Brooklyn Bridge, one view of the Manhattan Bridge, a view of the RMS <emph render="italic">Queen Mary</emph> in New York City waters, two images of Fiorello La Guardia, attending a public event-- one with his son Eric and the other with his wife Maria, daughter Jean, and son Eric, possibly aboard the <emph render="italic">Queen Mary</emph>, and one image of a radio address on WNYC radio by a group of unidentified men, also possibly aboard the <emph render="italic">Queen Mary</emph>. Finally, the collection documents the Rockaway Beach Excursion Line, a ferry line that ran along Sheepshead Bay and Jamaica Bay with stops in Queens and Brooklyn. Images of ferry landing piers at Roxbury, Rockaway Point, and Breezy Point in Queens are included, as is a ferry house that was located at Emmons Avenue and Kenmore Place in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn. Images of many of the ferries are also included.</p>  </scopecontent>
