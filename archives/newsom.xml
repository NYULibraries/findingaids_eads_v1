            <p>The materials contained in this collection are strong in highlighting the ideas, ideals, and philosophy of Newsom as expressed in his many academic and corporate roles, but offer little original information with regard to his tenure as President of

            <p>
                <persname>Carroll Newsom</persname>'s illustrious career, amply showcased in a resume which lists 52 major positions, 37 "minor positions," 9 published books and 24 honorary degrees (in addition to three earned degrees), is only partially illuminated by the materials contained in this collection. Nonetheless, the Newsom papers offer a glimpse of his career beyond his position as President of 
                <corpname>New York University</corpname>, and are of particular value in contributing to a knowledge of the ideas, philosophy, and achievements of this hybrid businessman-scholar.</p>
            <p>Carroll Newsom graduated from the 
                <corpname>College of Emporia</corpname>, 
                <geogname>Kansas</geogname> in 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1924</date>, receiving his A.B. degree in mathematics. A prodigy in mathematics, Newsom became an instructor of mathematics at the 
                <corpname>University of Michigan</corpname> in 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1927</date>, the institution from which he received his M.A. in 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1927</date> and PhD. in 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1931</date>. His achievements at this university anticipate his later career. Reworking the traditional mathematics curriculum of the university, which Newsom characterized simply as being "bad," Newsom had become a full professor and department chairman in the astonishingly short space of five years.</p>
            <p>During the Second World War, and the consequent increased demand for mathematicians and scientists, Newsom took a position as Chairman of the Science Division at 
                <corpname>Oberlin College</corpname>. Newsom had already written about both the positive and negative potential of atomic energy(in An American Philosophy of Education). During one meeting with a nervous President Truman, Newsom advised the new President to continue with the 
                <subject>Manhattan Project</subject>, after Truman had asked him, "Do you think this is something I should pursue?"</p>
            <p>At the war's end, Newsom and two other American doctors helped to reorganize medical education in 
                <geogname>France</geogname>, for which Newsom was later awarded the French Legion of Honor. Taking leave of 
                <corpname>Oberlin</corpname> in 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1948</date>, Newsom moved on to 
                <geogname>New York</geogname>, where he took the post of 
                <occupation>Assistant Commissioner of Higher Education</occupation> in 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1948</date>. As Associate Commissioner from 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1950 to 1955</date>, Newsom was instrumental in developing the state university system.</p>
            <p>Newsom's last stop on the educational trail was at 
                <corpname>New York University</corpname>, first as 
                <occupation>Executive Vice President</occupation> from 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1955 to 1956</date>, then as President from 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1956 to 1962</date> (his resignation took effect on 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">January 1, 1962</date>). His tenure as 
                <occupation>NYU President</occupation> was considered by the university trustees to be "the most fruitful in the university's history, in the increase of financial resources and in building expansion." During his presidency, 
                <corpname>NYU's</corpname> assets increased from $111 million to $178 million, a total of $70 million in gifts having been received during his tenure as President.</p>
            <p>Newsom moved on to the Senior Vice President slot at 
                <corpname>Prentice-Hall</corpname>, becoming president and director of the publishing firm in 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1964</date>. Yet once again, Newsom's brief tenure at 
                <corpname>Prentice-Hall</corpname> resembled that of a corporate raider, as he left the presidency of the firm in 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1965</date>, only one year after having taken the position. Actually, he resignation was partially prompted by the failure of RCA (of which Newsom was a Director) in its attempt to merge with 
                <corpname>Prentice-Hall</corpname>. For the next three years( 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1966 to 1969</date>), Newsom held the post of 
                <occupation>vice-president for education at RCA</occupation>, a position which permitted further work in one of Newsom's special fields of interest, that of educational television.</p>
            <p>The brevity of Newsom's tenure at various corporate institutions can be attributed in part to the multiplicity of his interests. As already mentioned, one of his foremost concerns was the educational potential of television, which Newsom glimpsed at the very germination of the new medium in the early 
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1950's</date>. His ideas were set forth in a landmark text on the subject, 
                <subject>A Television Policy for Education</subject> (
                <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1952</date>), which held its own for at least two decades as a authoritative source of information on 
                <subject>education television policy</subject>. Newsom's other interests include 
                <subject>religious history</subject>(one of his later books, 
                <title type="simple">
                    <emph render="underline">The Roots of Christianity</emph> </title>, was deemed "a truly great book" by Normal Vincent Peale), 
                <subject>third-world dilemmas</subject> (he served as President of 
                <corpname>American Friends of Ethiopia</corpname>), and, of course, his starting point, mathematics.</p>

                    <p>Series II consists of two major categories, publications of Newsom and publications about Newsom. The first category comprises 
                        <genreform>articles</genreform> published by Newsom in various 
                        <genreform>journals</genreform> and 
                        <genreform>periodicals</genreform>, spanning the years 
                        <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1940 to 1973</date>. The second category is a collection of periodicals which either contain articles about Newsom, or mention Newsom in word or image(sometimes finding these references to Newsom requires a minute search). Nonetheless, these latter materials are useful, especially in showcasing the many honors bestowed upon Newsom, such as awards, citations, and honorary degrees. At the end of Series II are publications which relate to Newsom's role on advisory committees at various periods, such as his role as 
                        <occupation>Chairman of the Governor's Committee on New Jersey Higher Education</occupation> in 
                        <date calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1963</date>(Box 6, Folder 11).</p>
