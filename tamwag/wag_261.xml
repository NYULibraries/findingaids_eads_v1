            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Robert Fitch was an independent journalist, labor union organizer and professor of political sociology, urban studies and labor studies. Born in December 1938 in Chicago, Fitch joined the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA) Local 5 at the age of 15 as a Laborer.</p>
            <p>Fitch attended the University of Illinois, where he earned his Bachelors degree in History. After service in the Air Force, where he worked in military intelligence, Fitch enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley. While earning his Masters in History, he helped to found the Revolutionary Union (which later became the Revolutionary Communist Party) with Bob Avakian, H. Bruce Franklin and Stephen Charles Hamilton. During this period, he also served as the editor of 
                <emph render="italic">Ramparts</emph>, and co-founded the magazine 
                <emph render="italic">Socialist Revolution</emph>, which later became 
                <emph render="italic">Socialist Review</emph>, and then 
                <emph render="italic">Radical Society</emph>.</p>
            <p>Fitch co-authored 
                <emph render="italic">Ghana: End of An Illusion</emph> with his wife Mary Oppenheimer, while he was at Berkeley. Published in 1968, the book describes the events leading up to the 1966 overthrow of the Kwame Nkrumah regime. A second book, 
                <emph render="italic">Who Rules The Corporation?</emph> was published in Japanese in 1978. In 1976, Fitch enrolled in the doctoral program of Sociology at the State University of New York at Binghamton. He received his Ph.D. in 1993, after completing his dissertation 
                <emph render="italic">The Political Economy of New York City: Space, Class and Power, 1958-1992</emph>.</p>
            <p>In 1980, Fitch began his career as a teacher, serving as an instructor at the Harry Van Arsdale Jr. Center for Labor Studies at Empire State College (Saratoga Springs, NY), where he would teach until 1985. He also began to teach in New York University’s Metropolitan Studies Department in 1981. In 1984, he was invited to be a Visiting Critic at Harvard University's Graduate School for Design. In 1985, he was offered a position as a Visiting Professor at the Graduate School of Business at Chuo University’s (Tokyo).</p>
            <p>After returning to the United States, Fitch returned for a short period to the Metropolitan Studies Department at New York University in 1988. He also worked as an organizer for the American Federation of Musicians, Local 802 in New York City from 1989 to 1990 as well as an adviser to the Communications Workers of America (CWA), Local 1180.</p>
            <p>Throughout the 1990s, he worked as a journalist, writing extensively for the 
                <emph render="italic">Village Voice</emph>, the 
                <emph render="italic">Nation</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">The Baffler</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Newsday</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Tikkun</emph> and other journals, magazines and newspapers. His articles from this period focus on corruption within labor unions, including election fraud, embezzlement of benefit funds and sweatshop conditions sanctioned by labor unions. In addition, he also pointed out corruption in local government, and the acquiescence of both government and labor to what he termed FIRE; finance, insurance and real estate interests, both on a local and national level. Many of these articles drew the ire of labor union officials and members, particularly those implicated by Fitch’s exposes. His book 
                <emph render="italic">The Assassination of New York</emph>, which expanded on these themes, was published by Verso in 1996.</p>
            <p>During this time, Fitch also taught and lectured at universities throughout New York City, including Long Island University, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Queens College and LaGuardia Community College (1993-2011).</p>
            <p>In 2006, Public Affairs published his book 
                <emph render="italic">Solidarity for Sale</emph>, which focused on union corruption, which Fitch argued had been a part of organized labor in the United States from its beginnings.</p>
            <p>Fitch died at the age of 72 in March 2011.</p>

            <p>The bulk of the collection consists of Fitch's research files on a variety of topics, including labor union corruption (particularly in relation to real estate deals and pension funds), political corruption, antisemitism, the development and government of New York City, and the history of labor unions. Fitch's handwritten notebooks and notecards, which document his research, interviews he conducted, and the development of his ideas, are also included in the collection. His speeches and writings are also present, including both drafts and copies of published articles. The collection also contains lectures and syllabi from classes Fitch taught at various institutions. A small number of cassette tapes, containing copies of 
                <emph render="italic">Crossing Wall Street</emph>, Fitch's show on WBAI-FM, as well as interviews with labor union members, are also present in the collection.</p>
            <p>There is also a small amount of personal material in the collection. It consists of correspondence, clippings, certificates and diplomas, files on Fitch's mother Jo, and profiles and tributes largely written after Fitch's death.</p>
