    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Afghanistan Digital Library was a joint project of the New York University Libraries, the Department of Middle Eastern Studies, the Center for Near Eastern Studies, and the Center on International Cooperation, established in circa 2002. It was created in response to damage and loss of Afghanistan's cultural heritage in the 1990s. The goal of the project was to make accessible Afghani publications in private and public collections digitally. In 2005, the project was awarded an National Endowment for the Humanities grant.</p>  </bioghist>
