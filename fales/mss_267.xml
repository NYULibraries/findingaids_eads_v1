    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Alan Sondheim is an author, musician, artist, and cyberspace theorist. He was born February 3, 1943 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and received a B.A. and M.A. in English from Brown University.</p><p>Sondheim's work explores embodiment in cyberspace and Codework, which is the use of computer coding languages for creative expression. His written works include <emph render="italic">Being on Line: Net Subjectivity (1997)</emph>, <emph render="italic">Disorders of the Real</emph> (1988), <emph render="italic">.echo</emph> (2001), <emph render="italic">Vel</emph> (Blazevox, 2004-5), <emph render="italic">Sophia</emph> (Writers Forum, 2004), <emph render="italic">The Wayward</emph> (2004), and <emph render="italic">Writing Under</emph> (2012), as well as numerous other chapbooks, ebooks, and articles. In 1994, Sondheim began a "continuous meditation on cyberspace" titled <emph render="italic">The Internet Text</emph>. This collection of writing and mixed media art is distributed via the email list "Cybermind" and displayed online (https://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/sondheim__internet_text.html).  He has also co-moderated several email lists, including "Cyberculture," "Wryting," "Fiction of Philosophy," "Image," and "Deleuze World." Sondheim's writing is philosophical and poetic in nature, often incorporating computer coding languages and concepts from online gaming communities.</p><p>Sondheim is also a musician, and has released numerous albums as a solo musical artist and a member of the groups Damaged Life and Ritual-All-7-70. He started out as a guitarist, and expanded to playing a variety of instruments, including ghijak, cura, saz, sarangi, sing lisu, harmonica, and Chinese mouth harp. His music is characterized as post-industrial, avant-garde, and free improvisation. He frequently collaborates with his partner, singer/songwriter Azure Carter. Sondheim has also collaborated extensively with Swiss choreographer and dancer Foofwa d'Imobilité (Frederic Gafner), as well as many other dancers, often using tools like motion capturing technology to explore themes of embodiment and sexuality in cyberspace.</p><p>Sondheim has created several films and videos, including <emph render="italic">The Blue Tape</emph> (1974, co-directed with Kathy Acker), <emph render="italic">Hollywood</emph> (1981), <emph render="italic">Postmodern Pobre</emph> (1992), <emph render="italic">Nikuko</emph> (2000), and <emph render="italic">Trilby</emph> (2002). Much of his filmography includes digital avatars that are manipulated with 3D blending software. He has also shot a large collection of travel and nature photography and videography. </p><p>Sondheim has completed residencies at the trAce Online Writing Centre of Nottingham-Trent University, SecondLife's Odyssey exhibition space, West Virginia University's Center for Literary Computer and Virtual Environments Laboratory, and Grand Central Art Center in Santa Ana. In 2001-2002, Sondheim taught New Media at Florida International University in Miami. In 2006-2007, he taught filmmaking at his alma mater, Brown University. His mixed media art has been exhibited and performed internationally and across the United States. He also speaks at symposiums, conferences, and cultural events that explore cyberspace theory, including the Cybermind96 Conference, CyPosium, and South by Southwest. </p>  </bioghist>

<p>In Winter of 2021 and Spring of 2022, the collection was arranged and described by an archivist. The collection was divided into series based on record type and material was arranged together intellectually within these series. Wherever possible, record titles were taken directly from descriptions or labels provided by Sondheim. Physically, items are stored together with others of the same format.</p><p>Films stored in unsuitable containers, many exhibiting signs of vinegar syndrome, were scanned and rehoused by Preservation during the collection survey process. Several audio reels were also rehoused. Images of the original containers have been preserved. </p><p>Several photographs received treatment from Preservation during the survey process, including photos that were stuck together, photos stuck in enclosures, and negative strips that required special housing.</p><p>Audio reel 267_124 in Box 24 (Barcode 31142063407004) was identified as moldy on December 6, 2021. Theis item is currently isolated from other items in the box by housing it in a polyethylene bag with a desiccated board and RH monitor strip. If this strip indicates an RH greater than 50%, the Preservation department should be contacted ASAP. Do not open this packaging without contacting the Preservation Department.</p><p>8 video reels in Box 82 were identified as moldy in October, 2021.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Alan Sondheim is an author, musician, artist, and cyberspace theorist.  His work explores embodiment in cyberspace and the use of computer technology and coding languages for personal and artistic expression. This collection contains Sondheim's intellectual and artistic work across many mediums, including written work, visual art, films and videos, musical recordings, multimedia exhibitions, and dance performances. </p><p>Sondheim's work is primarily concerned with the convergence of the real world with the virtual world, expressed through artistic creation and collaboration. The written work in this collection ranges from calculator programs to philosophical academic texts and poetic reflections on virtual environments. Some written pieces include multimedia and web elements, and some are nestled within email listservs.</p><p>The musical recordings in this collection include Sondheim's solo work, as well as works by the bands Damaged Life and Ritual-All-7-70 (often referred to as "All"). These recordings are characterized as post-industrial, avant-garde, and free improvisation, and include a large variety of musical instruments. In addition to sound recordings, this collection also holds written documents pertaining to Sondheim's musical career, such as set lists, performance flyers, liner notes, and circuitry diagrams. There are also many photographs of Sondheim and his contemporaries capturing Very Low Frequency (VLF) recordings in natural settings.</p><p>The films, videos, and visual art in this collection iterate on the human body manipulated with technology, often with 3D blending programs, motion capture techniques, and modern dance. Codework, a concept created by Sondheim that refers to the use of computer coding languages and technology for creative expression, can be found throughout the collection. Sondheim's work frequently explores sexual themes, and may include sexually explicit content.</p><p>In addition to his solo work, Sondheim has worked with numerous artists. Throughout the collection, collaborative pieces with musician Azure Carter, choreographer and dancer Foofwa d'Imobilité, writers Kathy Acker and Sandy Bladwin, filmmaker Leslie Thornton, poet Miekal And, and many others highlight the collaborative nature of Sondheim's work. </p><p>Sondheim's films, exhibitions, and dance performances have premiered across the U.S. and internationally. He has held residencies at the trAce Online Writing Centre, SecondLife's Odyssey, West Virginia University's Center for Literary Computer and Virtual Environments Laboratory, and Grand Central Art Center in Santa Ana. Sondheim has taught New Media at Florida International University (2001-2002), Filmmaking at Brown University (2006-2007), and has been an Artist in Residence at many other institutions. He has also appeared at many symposiums, conferences, and cultural events, including the Cybermind96 Conference, CyPosium, and South by Southwest. Sondheim's travels greatly influence his work, and in addition to event documentation, this collection includes a large volume of photographs and videos related to travel.</p>  </scopecontent>
