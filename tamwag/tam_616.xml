    <abstract id="aspace_cc23d6d697b3ecd496f3796631a3e705">Estela Bravo (1933- ) is an American-born documentary filmmaker who has been creating films on Cuba and Latin America with her husband Ernesto Bravo since the 1980s. Estela and Ernesto Bravo moved to Cuba in the early 1960s, and as a result many of Estela's films focus on political and cultural relations between the United States and Cuba. The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes and film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length features and video footage, the collection contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, home movies, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of historical events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; clips from Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage is primarily recorded on U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and distribution. This collection has been partially digitized, and only the digitized footage is currently accessible to researchers.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Estela Bravo (1933- ) is an American-born documentary filmmaker who has been creating films on Cuba and Latin America with her husband Ernesto Bravo since the 1980s. The Bravos moved to Cuba in the early 1960s, and as a result many of Estela Bravo's films focus on political and cultural relations between the United States and Cuba. Bravo's documentaries have aired on television networks including PBS (US), CBC (Canada), Channel 4 (UK) Canal Plus (France), and at international film festivals and retrospectives honoring her work.</p><p>Estela Bravo was born on June 8, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York. The youngest of three daughters, she was raised in a family of working-class European immigrants. Estela worked for the Furriers Union while studying sociology at night at Brooklyn College. In 1953 she helped organize a group called Students for a Peaceful World. She attended the 3rd World Student Congress in Warsaw, Poland as a representative for the Students for a Peaceful World, where she met Ernesto Bravo.</p><p>Ernesto Mario Bravo (1929- ) was born in Argentina on April 7, 1929. Bravo studied medicine at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1951, while still a student, he was targeted by the state police for his participation in a student strike and tried on charges of organizing anti-government student activities. </p><p>Estela and Ernesto Bravo married in January of 1956. They moved to Cuba in 1963 after Ernesto was offered a position as a Professor of Biochemistry at the Medical School of the University of Havana. In Cuba, Estela Bravo worked at the cultural institution Casa de las Américas where she organized programs promoting folk and protest music. She later began developing television programs and creating short documentaries based on archival footage, which documented notable figures like the Rosenbergs, Malcolm X, and Paul Robeson. Ernesto wrote many of the scripts for these short films. Estela Bravo completed her first full-length documentary in 1980, <emph render="italic">Those Who Left</emph>, which told the story of Cubans who left the island after the 1959 revolution. In addition to his teaching career, Ernesto Bravo has worked collaborator with his wife on her many documentary films, and has written a number of books, including <emph render="italic">Modern Medicine in Cuba</emph> (1995) and <emph render="italic">Development within Underdevelopment: New Trends in Cuban Medicine</emph> (1998).</p><p>As of 2016, Estela and Ernesto Bravo continue to make films. In 2014, they were honored in South Africa by the Mandela Foundation, they released films about Gabriel García Márquez and Commander Juan Almeida, and they updated their 2007 film, <emph render="italic">Who am I?

    <head>Processing Information Note</head>
<p>Upon receipt of this collection, Tamiment Library discovered that many of the videos had mold damage or binder hydrolysis. Several tapes have been repaired and digitized, but many have yet to receive treatment. The digitization process remains ongoing.</p><p>To facilitate preservation treatment, all tapes were initially inventoried and assigned a persistent identifier, which is listed in the finding aid as the "ref" number. These numbers are not sequential and are not listed in a specific order. Individual tapes have been arranged intellectually by the full-length feature in which they appear. Tapes were originally received in boxes containing packing slips that roughly associated footage with specific films. Much of this contextual information was lost, however, due to the immediate separation of materials for preservation treatment. Information about footage content and associated feature film(s) has been reconstructed to the best of the archivist's ability through analysis of container annotations, research, and consultation with the donors. Footage has been added to the series that best represents the context of its use. Estela Bravo frequently reused footage in multiple documentaries, and consequently some footage may be duplicated in more than one series.</p><p>Videos were sent for preservation treatment in multiple installments, which resulted in several non-sequential box numbers. In 2016, box numbers were updated and listed in sequential order. </p><p>Titles of digitized videos have been edited or supplied by the archivist based on the content of the recording. Titles of videos that have yet to be digitized have been derived from annotations on the individual film containers and associated notes. The descriptions of video cassettes that have not yet been digitized often contain phrases in quotation marks. These phrases were copied from annotations on the cassette boxes. As digitized versions of the videos become available, descriptions are being updated.</p><p>Many of the videos in this collection were undated. The majority of the dates have been estimated by the archivist based on release date of the film or the event documented in the footage.</p><p>Two additional donations of ephemera, publications, transcripts, and promotional materials were donated in 2014 and 2015. Documents associated with specific films were incorporated the existing series, while publications and ephemera more generally associated with filmmaking and Estela Bravo's career were added as Series XXX: Collected Ephemera and Publications. Films reels documenting moments in Estela and Ernesto Bravo's personal lives were added as Series XXXI: Estela and Ernesto Bravo Family Films.</p><p>In 2016 videos stored on a hard drive and flash drive were forensically imaged and analyzed. Duplicate copies of full-length documentaries were deaccessioned and remaining videos were incorporated into series based on the documentaries with which they correspond.</p><p>In 2017, a copy of the documentary <emph render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph> was added to the collection as Series XXXII: <emph render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph>.</p><p>In 2018, 255 videos were digitized and described at the item-level.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Estela and Ernesto Bravo Film and Video Collection (dates 1959-2014) contains interviews, footage, and full-length films from documentaries created by filmmaker Estela Bravo between the 1980s and early 2000s. The collection contains over 1,300 video tapes and film reels recorded by Bravo throughout her career. In addition to full-length documentaries and video footage, the collection also contains a small amount of ephemera, correspondence, and documentation related to the promotion and licensing of Bravo's films. Footage in this collection consists of interviews with political leaders and celebrities; scenes of important events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; historical clips from Cuba's State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and background footage (b-roll) used in finished films. This footage was primarily recorded on U-matic and Betacam video tapes, and produced on film reels, VHS, and DVD for screening and distribution.</p><p>Many of Bravo's films focus broadly on Cuba after the revolution and its relationship with the United States and other countries. Bravo's films address other issues related to Latin American politics and culture, exploring topics such as: children abducted during Argentina's "Dirty War;" Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship; the assassination of Maurice Bishop in Grenada; social and economic problems caused by Latin American debts owed to the United States; struggles to end apartheid in South Africa; and a 1984 concert featuring Cuban musicians Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes in Buenos Aires.</p><p>The most extensive footage comes from <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> and its follow-up <emph render="italic">Anecdotes about Fidel</emph>. There are more than 400 video recordings related to these films. Among the highlights of this material are interviews with notable individuals including: Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, George McGovern, Alice Walker, Harry Belafonte, Philip Agee, Ted Turner, Edward Heath, Jorge Risquet, Ricardo Alarcón, Vilma Espín, and Angela Davis. These videos also contain interviews with supporters of the anti-Castro movement including counter-revolutionaries like Orlando Bosch.</p><p>Other films featured prominently in this collection address the social consequences of tensions between the United States and Cuba. These films include <emph render="italic">Americans in Cuba</emph>, documenting American who moved to Cuba after the revolution; <emph>The Cuban Excludables</emph>, which follows Cubans who came to the United States during the Mariel boatlift and the conditions they faced while being detained by US authorities; and  <emph render="italic">Miami-Havana</emph>, a film that explores the consequences of travel and communication restrictions between Cuba and the United States.</p><p>Not all of Bravo's films are represented in the collection. Footage from some films may be more complete than others, while footage from other films does not appear in the collection at all. In other cases video footage is duplicated in multiple series. Bravo frequently reused older footage in follow-up documentaries to provide background and context for a subsequent film. For example, footage from the 1985 film, <emph render="italic">Missing Children</emph>, also appears in the 2007 documentary, <emph render="italic">Who Am I?: The Found Children of Argentina</emph>. Additionally, there are many interviews that exceed the duration of a single tape, and are recorded on multiple tapes. These interviews will contain pauses and breaks in the conversation to allow the videographer to change tapes.</p><p>The collection also contains footage that was not included in any feature film. These recordings may have been shot with a potential film in mind, but were never included in any completed feature. The Bravos also recorded special events or interviews with notable individuals, even though they did not intend to include them in a specific documentary. These recordings include an interview with Mikis Theodrakis, a Greek songwriter/composer and supporter of Fidel Castro, and an interview with Brazilian Communist Party leader Luis Carlos Prestes (1898-1990). There is also some footage which is unidentified or has not yet been associated with a specific feature film.</p><p>Between 2014 and 2015, two additional donations of periodicals, programs, playbills, transcripts, and related items were added to the collection. They may be found in Series XXX: Ephemera and Publications. Transcripts and partial transcripts from this donation relate to the film <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> and have been added to Series VIII. Transcripts contain interviews of some individuals for which there is no film footage, including Walter Sisulu and Kalema Moutante. A small set of film reels, donated in 2014, contain personal family footage of Estela and Ernesto Bravo with friends and family members, most of which were filmed in 1958. These reels are arranged in Series XXXI: Estela and Ernesto Bravo Family Films.</p><p>Many of the dates in this collection have been estimated based on the content and release date of the film. Specific dates are listed if they appeared on the cassette annotations, while others were inferred from the film's content. The word "Bump" appears in several titles, and was used by Estela Bravo to indicate clips selected from a previous, longer, piece of footage.</p>  </scopecontent>

The 2001 documentary <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> combines a history of the Cuban revolution with a more personal story of leader, Fidel Castro. This series contains copies of both films. It includes complete interviews and portions of interviews highlighted in the two films. They feature historians, public figures, close friends, and Castro himself, and provide a glimpse into the life and personality of the Cuban leader. Interviewees include Alice Walker, Gabriel García Márquez, Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, Ted Turner, Nelson Mandela, Charles Rangel, George McGovern, Philip Agee, and many others who share personal anecdotes along with political and historical perspectives.</p><p>The anecdotes come not only from well-known Americans such as Harry Belafonte, Jesse Jackson, Angela Davis, Hank Aaron, Sydney Pollack and others, but also from many Cubans who are not well known in the United States. Among them are government officials and friends of Fidel such as Juan Almeida, Melba Hernández. Alfredo Guevara, Jorge Risquet, Antonio Núñez Jiménez, Alicia Alonso, Angela Castro, and Aleida Guevara.</p><p>This series also contains a number of interviews that are not seen in the films. They include discussions with Hortensia Bussi de Allende, the widow of Salvador Allende, and American lawyer Victor Rabinowitz.</p><p>Footage in this series also consists of clips from the Cuban State Council Archives and various news sources. Videos containing State Council footage often represent a wide date range. Some of the footage is dated 1998 which reflects the date the material was obtained, not the actual date of the events. The original dates of the footage were not recorded. Additional footage depicts Fidel Castro at a number of public events giving speeches or speaking with world leaders. Other materials in this series include documents related to the promotion and distribution of <emph render="italic">Fidel</emph>, including contact lists, posters, correspondence related to distribution rights.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1903" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph></unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="590451" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">590451</unitid><unitdate normal="2000/2000" type="inclusive">2000</unitdate><container id="aspace_7b404f35369d746b1be3d2ca0e239307" label="Master reel [31142054860542]" type="Reel">ref1903_01</container><container id="aspace_5eb6e482b2c5a768754c037fc984049b" label="Master reel [31142054860559]" type="Reel">ref1903_02</container><container id="aspace_d5b8f15c7578eb9e430e03d8fb53e1ae" label="Master reel [31142054860567]" type="Reel">ref1903_03</container><container id="aspace_7a29fb54ee52595f89ceec8891786975" label="Master reel [31142054860575]" type="Reel">ref1903_04</container><container id="aspace_8b7a2f9dc35014ab160edcb18d9f77a8" label="Master reel [31142054860583]" type="Reel">ref1903_05</container><container id="aspace_3e417824c0f986e931c2be5a71f979ee" label="Master reel [31142054860591]" type="Reel">ref1903_06</container><container id="aspace_70badf74050e1ced65c7091e9e3240b1" label="Master reel [31142054860609]" type="Reel">ref1903_07</container><container id="aspace_6a863c9956de3edc6abb751bd8af4244" label="Master reel [31142054860617]" type="Reel">ref1903_08</container><container id="aspace_166426eae7bd34667fc130c9dfe88d23" label="Master reel [31142054860625]" type="Reel">ref1903_09</container><container id="aspace_8442f5ecff39dc23368dc56aa00798be" label="Master reel [31142054860633]" type="Reel">ref1903_10</container><container id="aspace_d1774c1caad30a6b9572a6fcf0fbca84" label="Master reel [31142054860641]" type="Reel">ref1903_11</container><container id="aspace_58794570638231ca85841b5cf529c453" label="Master reel [31142054860658]" type="Reel">ref1903_12</container><container id="aspace_73a15c29c7893d396bf3460a1691adbd" label="Master reel [31142054860666]" type="Reel">ref1903_13</container><container id="aspace_9cf29fa94425a844341ff955876a16df" label="Master reel [31142054860674]" type="Reel">ref1903_14</container><container id="aspace_dac1f9eb7480d797c0668a44bf87344c" label="Master reel [31142054860682]" type="Reel">ref1903_15</container><container id="aspace_881e2a39fac33cfe81dd59c8702c2e29" label="Master reel [31142054860690]" type="Reel">ref1903_16</container><container id="aspace_437cc124ffd6df13f31bf306ebc4fe24" label="Master reel [31142054860708]" type="Reel">ref1903_17</container><container id="aspace_d8d67cf67a258a1e69b3f5c796f709a0" label="Master reel [31142054860716]" type="Reel">ref1903_18</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_f5cfe98a15dd6b51f743a889106ba6f1"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This is a full-length version of the film <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph>.

He talks about the ways in which the struggle shifted Americans' perceptions of both Cuba and the exile community in Miami. The conversation then shifts to a general discussion about the way American opinions about Cuba are shaped by the press, which Bourne contrasts with that of other Latin American countries. The second part of the interview focuses on human rights in Cuba, healthcare, and education. He also briefly discusses why some Cubans have left the country, the Cuban economy, and the waning support Cuba received from the Soviet Union beginning in the 1980s.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_4ac85d39b9dccccde0e2caa0ee47eeeb"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

Castro contends that she does not believe Revuelta is her brother's daughter, but notes that he has never denied paternity. She also discusses her sister Juana Castro, who opposed her brother's politics and moved to the United States. Later in the interview Castro speaks about the impact the Cuban Revolution had on her life and her experience of having Fidel Castro as both a brother and a president. She also addresses criticism that her children received preferential treatment because Castro was their uncle.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_1753a849713995feea4b4ca05a361c70"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

Frady argues that many of the negative reactions against Castro were formed during the Cold War, and that much of the antipathy directed at Castro formed as a result of decades of poor diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States. The bulk of the interview focuses on popular perceptions of Fidel Castro, in which Frady describes him as a figure that inspired passionate reactions, both positive and negative.

The video begins with footage of images in Fusté's office and an interview that starts at minute 5:30. Fusté begins by speculating about end of the Castro presidency, which he predicts will occur within a year of the time in which the interview was conducted.

Leal also describes the relationship between Castro and other prominent individuals in Cuba including Che Guevara, Celia Sanchez, Carlos Rafael Rodríguez, Conchita Fernandez, and Baudillo Castellano. Finally, he discusses Castro as a polarizing figure and talks about the opposition of many Cubans to his leadership.

He argues that what Cuba needs most is not internal political reform, but rather a change in the United States foreign policy toward Cuba. He argues that the United States needs to respect Cuban sovereignty by lifting the blockade and improving diplomatic relations with the Cuban government. Ortega states that he does not think Castro believes in Communism, but rather adopted the political structure in opposition to the United States. He suggests that by aligning with the Soviet Union Castro hoped avoid a US funded coup similar to the overthrow of Jacobo Árbenz in Guatemala.

He also talks about the custody battle over Elián González and the image of Fidel Castro as a figure of anti-imperialism in Latin American. At minute 16:31 the footage changes to an interview with Max Lesnik. Lesnik describes his acquaintance with Castro at the University of Havana, where they were classmates.

Sheinbaum talks about meeting Fidel Castro and his impression of Castro as a political leader, which he contrasts with his experience meeting Syrian leader Bashar al Assad. Filmed sometime between 1995 and 1996, Sheinbaum discusses the passage of the Helm-Burton Act by the US Congress, and speculates about impact of the upcoming 1996 elections on US policy toward Cuba. He addresses the criticism and admiration of Castro, and compares Castro's government with Cuba under the presidency of Fulgencio Batista. He also discusses a potential meeting between Castro and President Bill Clinton, but suggests that such a meeting would be contingent on the political situation in the United States. The end of the interview features still images of Sheinbaum with both Castro and Clinton.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_45ed9cf64eb19e99b8a7e3a4d6e19784"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

Castro begins speaking around minute 5:00. He begins by offering his support and hope for the creation of a new South Africa led by Nelson Mandela, and commends Mandela for his commitment to justice following the end of the apartheid system. Castro calls for an end to divisions on the basis of race, and encourages South Africa and its political leaders to seek to address problems in economic inequality. He discusses the history of colonialism, which led to slavery and exploitation across the globe, expresses his hope that the new South African government will serve as an example of how to break free from the legacy of that system.

These clips are mostly black and white and in some places there is no sound. Most are in Spanish, but there is a small amount of narration in English. There are also shots of enthusiastic crowds as Castro and his entourage travel through the countryside and into Havana. Some footage appears to have been shot in Harlem during Fidel's visit to the United Nations.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_6cd7b8b5c161060002fffc7261fef5fe"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

On July 2,1986, Quintana, along with a young photographer, Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, were participating in a student protest in Santiago. They were attacked and beaten by a patrol of military police, soaked with gasoline, and set on fire. De Negri died of his burns. Gloria suffered second and third degree burns over 62% of her body; she was critically ill and was moved to a hospital in Canada. Although she survived, Gloria was badly disfigured from her burns. When the Pope visited Chile in 1987, she returned and was able to meet with the pontiff in Santiago.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_960dbd3ddbeb0d33073cec02dfdcd0c4"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>The 43-minute documentary <emph render="italic">Holy Father and Gloria</emph> (<emph render="italic">El Santo Padre y la Gloria</emph>) was released in 1987 and captures the turbulence of Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship. It traces the story of Carmen Gloria Quintana and her 1987 journey back to Chile to see the Pope. In addition to footage of the Pope's visit and the ongoing protests the documentary includes interviews with Quintana and many others. Among the voices captured are those of elites, particularly young people, who supported the Pinochet government and felt the protests were unnecessary. Footage in this series includes shots of Quintana touring Chile, speeches by the Pope, interviews with Quintana and other Chileans, and historical footage contextualizing Chilean politics.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1907" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">El Santo Padre y la Gloria</emph></unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="590455" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">590455</unitid><unitdate normal="1987/1987" type="inclusive">1987</unitdate><container altrender="Hollinger Cassette Box 9.5" id="aspace_4f8a5db41293d741e9536790f713afe2" label="Master dvd [31142062673119]" type="Box">73</container><container parent="aspace_4f8a5db41293d741e9536790f713afe2" type="Dvd">10</container></did><phystech id="aspace_c0427e2672c7e13cdf0a6262ff8a8595"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Content of this DVD is born-digital.

Estela Bravo asks the students, who are from middle and upper-class schools, about their opinions of Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, Pope John Paul II's visit, and the attack on Carmen Gloria Quintana. Students from the various groups express different opinions on these topics, and many of the students who come from upper-class households express their support of Pinochet. They argue that the people protesting his government are mistaken and supporters of terrorism. Several students express their admiration for Pinochet, and contend that he saved the country from communism. Other students express their dislike of Pinochet, and contend that the students who support him are uninformed and are not in a position to understand the political situation of the country.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_46d744c548c31372790512f81284b5e7"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Umatic.

Additionally, there are places where imaging is poor and scenes are difficult to view.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref157" level="file"><did><unittitle>"Mandela Press Conference in Havana" </unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="467896" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">467896</unitid><unitdate normal="1991/1991" type="inclusive">1991</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_ca4c34c7e17331b268f8e20c7ff5d030" label="Videos" type="Box">7</container><container parent="aspace_ca4c34c7e17331b268f8e20c7ff5d030" type="Cassette">ref157</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref703" level="file"><did><unittitle>Fidel and Mandela in Matanzas: Footage at beginning of rally</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="467350" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">467350</unitid><unitdate normal="1991/1991" type="inclusive">1991 July 26</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_dcf366bff2a8a47ea0d13aaba28da3b1" label="Videos" type="Box">87</container><container parent="aspace_dcf366bff2a8a47ea0d13aaba28da3b1" type="Cassette">ref703</container><container altrender="Media Box 5.5" id="aspace_5e6415adb26c0fcc7d67ee81dcebad26" label="Access dvd [31142062673127]" type="Box">83</container><container parent="aspace_5e6415adb26c0fcc7d67ee81dcebad26" type="Dvd">ref703</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_5ba7f6129a1f70e51a4e11d41e72b42c"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This footage documents the early parts of a July 1991 rally at Matanzas with Nelson Mandela, honoring the 38th anniversary of the Moncada assault that led to Fidel Castro's seizure of power.

In a joint agreement between the United States and Cuba, some 125,000 refugees left the Cuban port of Mariel bound for the United States in what came to be known as the Mariel Boatlift. Cubans who traveled to the US as part of the boatlift came to be known as Marielitos.</p><p>Estela Bravo's documentary about the boatlift, <emph render="italic">The Marielitos</emph>, won the International Organization of Journalists 1st Prize at the 1984 Leipzig Film Festival and a Patria Society Award at the Moscow Film Festival.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_ref1297" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">Los Marielitos</emph></unittitle><unitid>cuid390</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="479640" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">479640</unitid><unitdate normal="1982/1982" type="inclusive">circa 1982</unitdate><langmaterial id="aspace_a59221ed46eccb6d0bb3da1b767a9729">This documentary is in Spanish with English subtitles.</langmaterial><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_9e984ebea1ceea361910ca85820fd45c" label="Videos" type="Box">57</container><container parent="aspace_9e984ebea1ceea361910ca85820fd45c" type="Cassette">ref1297</container><container altrender="Media Box 5.5" id="aspace_a67647b44b81eeacf7e03a561f523037" label="Access dvd [31142063007119]" type="Box">96</container><container parent="aspace_a67647b44b81eeacf7e03a561f523037" type="Dvd">ref1297</container></did><dao ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/j9kd5881" ns2:role="Video-Service" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="&lt;emph render=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;Los Marielitos&lt;/emph&gt;" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p><emph render="italic">Los Marielitos</emph>: circa 1982</p></daodesc></dao><scopecontent id="aspace_785754c378a3699b15bf728cf6c593a7"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This video contains a complete version of the documentary <emph render="italic">Los Marielitos</emph>.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_7daf222f5d873243b0c670c1663f3d6f"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Umatic.

They talk about the economic recession in the United States, lack of representation, lack of support for poor communities, and the difficulty of uniting Latin Americans in the United States because they come from so many different countries. They address other concerns, including the difficulty of organizing for more rights because they are too busy working at low wage jobs.

In the wake of the rumors, Cuban parents sent as many as 14,000 unaccompanied children on flights out of Cuba between 1960 and 1962. The United States government facilitated this mass exodus of Cuban children, which became popularly known as Operation Peter Pan, through a clandestine program that waived the children's visa requirements and provided several million dollars to the Miami Catholic Welfare Bureau to care for the children. Many parents expected to be reunited with their children after what they believed would be the swift fall communist government. Following the Bay of Pigs invasions in 1962, however, US-Cuba relations deteriorated, and permanently separated many parents and children. Some children were able to connect with family members in the United States, but approximately 7000 were moved into long-term orphanages or foster care.</p><p>Estela Bravo's documentary <emph render="italic">Operation Peter Pan: Flying Back to Cuba</emph> about the experience of these children was selected as Best Documentary Feature at the 2011 Havana Film Festival in New York.

He describes the motivation of many Cuban parents who decided to send their children to the United States in the early 1960s, explaining that many feared their children would be sent to Russia for communist indoctrination. He also discusses his organization's role in clandestine efforts to send Cuban children the US, and explains that parents expected Castro would be overthrown and their children would quickly return.

Most of the exiles were either supporters of former president Salvador Allende or activists on the political left who feared abuse under the new government. Exiles were barred from returning for many years, but by 1984 the Chilean government agreed to grant most of the exiles permission to return home. This opening was spurred by international pressure and a domestic campaign to abolish restrictions on exiles. </p><p><emph render="italic">Returning to Chile</emph>, which documents the return of Chilean political exiles, won a 1986 Silver Toucan Award at the Rio de Janiero International Film Festival.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_506c04b09f28d233fab1c85c8d0d8b70"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>Estela Bravo's 1986 documentary <emph render="italic">Returning to Chile</emph> tells the story of Chileans exiles who returned to the country in the mid-1980s. This documentary explores the experience of youth who returned to Chile without their parents after living in exile for many years.  Several of the youths featured in the documentary discuss their difficulty adjusting to life in Chile and struggles with identity. A portion of the film focuses on Carlos Godoy Echegoyen, a twenty-three-year-old Socialist who died under torture in a police station in the port of Quintero in February 1985, shortly after returning from exile. Bravo interviews his mother and his sister. It also features scenes in a cemetery at Godoy's grave and the graves of others, including Victor Jara, and Salvador Allende. The film also tells the story of three children from one family whose parents were taken and who must fend for themselves.</p><p>Videos in this series include full-length copies of the documentary with subtitles in English as well as raw footage and interviews. Footage features cemetery scenes, discussions about Carlos Godoy, Chilean religious and social welfare groups, speeches by Pinochet, and other background scenes. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2162" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">Returning to Chile</emph></unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="593065" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">593065</unitid><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">1 Reels</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="1986/1986" type="inclusive">1986</unitdate><container id="aspace_a937f43502f43da484d21c358d6c5568" label="Master reel [31142054860856]" type="Reel">ref2162_01</container><container id="aspace_3e5ea0f383923765f57961a4549bacbd" label="Master reel [31142054860864]" type="Reel">ref2162_02</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2167" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">Returning to Chile</emph></unittitle><unitid>2013.014</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="593072" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">593072</unitid><unitdate normal="1986/1986" type="inclusive">1986</unitdate><container id="aspace_b87df58b794561a5a3b64a851a226c69" label="Master reel [31142054860922]" type="Reel">ref2167</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1302" level="file"><did><unittitle><emph render="italic">Returning to Chile</emph></unittitle><unitid>cuid791</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="479645" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">479645</unitid><unitdate normal="1986/1986" type="inclusive">1986</unitdate><langmaterial id="aspace_e00b55ec9b4cc0d0391d8ce80c9b64a0">This documentary is in Spanish with subtitles in English.</langmaterial><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_e71ba769f71785a4687f4940535fa89f" label="Videos" type="Box">57</container><container parent="aspace_e71ba769f71785a4687f4940535fa89f" type="Cassette">ref1302</container><container altrender="Media Box 5.5" id="aspace_15d5579d85dcea4e85a78b0c04d589ac" label="Access dvd [31142063007119]" type="Box">96</container><container parent="aspace_15d5579d85dcea4e85a78b0c04d589ac" type="Dvd">ref1302</container></did><dao ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/wm37q3kr" ns2:role="Video-Service" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="&lt;emph render=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;Returning to Chile&lt;/emph&gt;" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p><emph render="italic">Returning to Chile</emph>: 1986</p></daodesc></dao><scopecontent id="aspace_5c2bdaa3c638dc6c08b4ef5a51c56447"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This video contains a full version of short documentary <emph render="italic">Returning to Chile</emph>.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_32b09dbd3984cae76ac9e826a4804eff"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Umatic.

The footage features a series of on-the-street interviews conducted by Estela Bravo in Union City, New Jersey in which she asks the men why they traveled to the United States and what they hoped to find. The majority of the men interviewed were living in the United States for less than a year at the time the interviews were conducted. Many mention that they left Cuba because they did not agree with the communist government. Others explain that they left to find better work and earn money although several mention that they have had a difficult time finding work in the United States. They likewise describe finding it difficult to get adequate housing and access to medical care. One man notes that he has received little support from the existing Cuban community in the US, and has received more support from other immigrant groups including Puerto Ricans and Dominicans. Some of the men mention travelling to the US as part of the Mariel Boatlift. The term "escoria" refers to a statement made by Fidel Castro about Cuban exiles, comparing those who left to escoria (scum).</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_db56a86858d30a9cc196999bd53a0e65"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Umatic.

Some of the videos contain footage that was shot independently, and not for a specific film. Examples of these recordings include clips from Brazil, from Mexico, and an interview concerning the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). This series also contains several clips relating to Nelson Mandela for which the specific film cannot be determined. Other footage that cannot be associated with a specific film due to lack of contextual information is also included in this series. An example is an interview Bravo conducted with three individuals in New York. The original box annotations suggest that these individuals are Dominicans but there is no indication of the specific film.  The conversation with these individuals continues on more than one cassette. It is unclear whether this is independent material or may have been created for a specific film.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1338" level="file"><did><unittitle>"2nd Anniversary of the War of the Malvinas (No Borrar)"</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="479681" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">479681</unitid><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_154dc966aebbf9a8cbf0af07517ba10c" label="Videos" type="Box">59</container><container parent="aspace_154dc966aebbf9a8cbf0af07517ba10c" type="Cassette">ref1338</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1065" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rosenberg Memorial Ceremony</unittitle><unitid>cuid401</unitid><unitid audience="internal" identifier="479404" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">479404</unitid><unitdate>undated</unitdate><langmaterial id="aspace_69575a257097ad7953338ce274f8c4de">This video is in Spanish.</langmaterial><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_f42cd98a18213cf865a78b924f505f03" label="Videos [31142063166188]" type="Box">63</container><container parent="aspace_f42cd98a18213cf865a78b924f505f03" type="Cassette">ref1065</container><container altrender="Media Box 5.5" id="aspace_08f8db5f23f91d313ec92dc01d0c3ecf" label="Access dvd [31142063007119]" type="Box">96</container><container parent="aspace_08f8db5f23f91d313ec92dc01d0c3ecf" type="Dvd">ref1065</container></did><dao ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/41ns20ft" ns2:role="Video-Service" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="Rosenberg Memorial Ceremony" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Rosenberg Memorial Ceremony: undated</p></daodesc></dao><scopecontent id="aspace_d54990336d9364c3a1f88400afe57ec0"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This video features two minutes of a Cuban news report on a memorial ceremony in honor of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg at the Rosenberg Memorial in Havana.

The first interview features the widow of Cuban pacifist Luciano Nieves. She discusses her husband's assassination, and describes him as a pioneer for calling for improved relations between the US and Cuba in the 1970s. The second interview features anti-Castro political activist Felipe Rivero. Rivero discusses his involvement in the Bay of Pigs invasion and addresses criticism about members of his movement who have been charged with or convicted of terrorism. He specifically discusses members of his organization who were convicted for the assassination of Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier. The third interview features Miami priest Father Bryan Walsh. Walsh discusses his role in sponsoring Cuban children traveling to the US without their parents between 1960 and 1962, and the US government's role in supporting that work. The final 30 minutes to the tape feature assorted clips recorded from television. Video and audio quality is very poor and the bulk of the content on the second half of this tape is difficult to view.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_2ef79bbdeed912ac97d52365baecf671"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Umatic.

A small portion of the interviewees discuss their family members who are in the United States and the difficulty of reconnecting them. They discuss the difficulty of obtaining visas to see their family in the US, and the pain of family separation. The majority of the people featured in the video, however, state that they do not have family abroad and talk generally about their pride as Cubans and their desire to stay in their country. Others discuss their opposition to the US blockade and US policy toward Cuba.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_6f6847fa2f78f8b850c877c0d2cf558e"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Original Format: Betacam.

Clippings include copies of articles about Estela Bravo's films, interviews, reviews, and biographical articles about her career as a filmmaker. A large portion of this series consists of programs for conferences and documentary film festivals. Bravo's films were shown at many of these festivals but not all. The series also contains several playbills from dance and theatrical performances attended by the Bravos. Playbills do not relate to filmmaking, but rather reflect the artistic interests of the Bravos. Additionally, the series contains copies of the documentaries <emph render="italic">Porque Moncada?</emph> and <emph render="italic">Manos a la Obra</emph>. These documentaries were not created by Estela Bravo, but they address topics similar to those featured in her films.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2102" level="file"><did><unittitle>Camp

Reels contain footage of events including parties, vacations, and visits with family. They feature the Bravos during the early years of their marriage and include footage of personal moments with their children and friends. The home movies were shot in a number of locations including New York, Miami, Paris, and São Paulo. A set of reels in this series were numbered 1-7; these numbers were created by Estela and Ernesto Bravo. Several reels were accompanied with limited contextual information and have yet to be identified. Family films that are in digital formats contain similar content as several of the reels, and many have been modified to contain sound. Several videos have been overlaid with music, while others contain audio of Estela Bravo explaining events captured in the films. Contents of these videos largely document the travels of the Bravos in the 1950s.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2116" level="file"><did><unittitle>1.

of the complete documentary <emph render="italic">Gema de Cuba</emph>. The 2017 documentary recounts the experience of Gerardo Hernández and his wife Adriana Perez who attempted to conceive a child while Hernández was serving two consecutive life sentences in the United States for espionage. Hernández, along with four other Cuban agents, was arrested in Miami in 1998 for spying on the United States, they became known as the Cuban Five. The Cuban government claimed they were spying on anti-Cuban terrorists  in Miami, but the five were ultimately convicted of espionage and acting as foreign agents. In 2014 as US-Cuban relations began to thaw the United States government helped Hernández and Perez conceive a child through artificial insemination. Hernández and two other Cuban agents were released that year in exchange for several American prisoners in Cuba. Hernández returned to Cuba two months before the birth of his daughter, Gema.</p></scopecontent></c></dsc>
