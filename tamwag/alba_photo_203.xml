      <head>Scope and Contents</head>
      <p>This collection consists of ca. 300 black and white, 35mm slides; the images are of Spanish
        Civil War-era Spain and include scenes of wartime destruction, refugees, street and
        battlefield scenes, a bullfight, and village life. There are also a few shots of naval
        vessels on the coast of North Africa and a few images of snowy mountains. The many shots of
        Nationalist troops, Spanish officials, and individuals in German uniform suggest that the
        photographs might have been taken by a German visitor, touring Spain toward the end of, or
        just after, the Civil War. The slides were the property of Eric Muller, a professional
        photographer from Lynn, MA, who got them from a returning U.S. serviceman who had served in
        Europe in World War II.</p>
