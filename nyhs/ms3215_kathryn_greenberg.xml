<p>The files retain the labeling from the original accordion files delivered to N-YHS by Kathryn Greenberg, though the contents have been rehoused into archival folders. The files are arranged roughly by type of institution/philanthropic matter: legal (especially Cardozo Law School), educational (other than Cardozo), and medical/aging.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Kathryn Adele (Olson) Greenberg was born in Minnesota. She attended the University of Minnesota and graduated from the University of Colorado in 1968, majoring in Art History. She went to Los Angeles for graduate school, then moved to New York City to work on Wall Street.</p><p>In 1979, Olson entered Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, graduating cum laude in 1982. She worked for Shea &amp; Gould as a trusts and estates lawyer. In 1987, she married Alan C. ("Ace") Greenberg, the head of the financial firm, Bear Stearns.</p><p>In 1988, Kathryn returned to Cardozo Law School as a Supervising Attorney at the Bet Tzedeck Clinic, which provided student lawyers to help low-income people with legal assistance. Seeking to move beyond the resource constraints inherent at Bet Tzedeck, Greenberg left in 1990 to start New York Legal Assistance Group (NYLAG) to provide free legal services for low-income New Yorkers. She remained Chair of the organization until about 2001 when she stepped down. </p><p>Greenberg was a member of Cardozo's Board of Directors from 1998-2000 and 2003-2010. She was Chair of the Board from 2004 until she left the position in 2010, becoming Board Chair Emerita. That same year she received Cardozo's Award for Extraordinary Leadership. Along with her husband, Alan (who died in 2014), Greenberg was a philanthropist, donating substantial time and funds to the Cardozo Law School, other educational institutions, medical facilities, and other institutions.</p><p>(The above note was based on documents in the collection.)</p>  </bioghist>
