    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>These records cover the latter portion of the African Free-Schools' existence, ending two years before oversight for the schools was transferred to the Public School Society. They relate to classroom observation, student performance, behavior and promotions, as well as examples of lessons and student work.</p><p>The records comprise four volumes. The first includes regulations, by-laws, and reports, from 1817 to 1832. The regulations are for the formate of the school's examination procedures, while the reports give numbers of students promoted for each quarter. These are limited to school No. 1. A substantive portion of the volume is also made up of observations of the visting committee, giving their impressions of the progress being made, along with the behavior and organization of the classroom and students.</p><p>The second volume is also filled with reports and observations of the visiting committee, but these are limited to school No. 2, and cover 1820 to 1831. Added to the closing pages of the volume are several pages of lessons on adding, subtracting and division of money, with examples.</p><p>The third volume includes extracts, compositions, addresses and pieces spoken at public examinations for 1818 to 1826, but early pages do include some material on promotions.</p><p>The fourth volume compliments the third with penmanship and drawing studies by the students (1816-1826). Of particular interest are copies of the speech given by James McCune Smith on the occasion of the Marquis de La Fayette's visit to New York in 1824.</p><p>While there is little, if any, information on individuals in the first two volumes, attributions are often given for the material appearing in volumes three and four. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>In order to further the objectives of its organization, the New-York Manumission Society founded the New-York African Free-School in 1787. Since the school was devoted to the education of black boys and girls as preparation for life as free citizens, it was an important extension of the Manumission Society's efforts to lobby for the abolition of slavery and manumission of New York slaves, and to advocate on behalf of those already freed.</p><p>Beginning with a single schoolhouse on Cliff Street (that would burn down in 1814), the African Free-School ultimately boasted seven school buildings around the city. The schools employed the Lancasterian system of education, with a broad, practically based curriculum, covering standards such as reading, writing, penmanship, grammar and arithmetic, as well as religion, sciences, geography and after 1791, needlework. Blacks were represented on its staff, which included John Teasman, who served both as a teacher and later as principal of the school.</p><p>As the New-York Manumission Society's role ebbed with the end of slavery in New York, it eventually turned the African Free-Schools over to the New York Public School Society in 1834. All the schools subsequently became fully part of the public school system thirteen years later in 1847.</p><p>Operating from the belief that education would be an essential component in helping blacks to improve their position in American society, the school played a significant role in producing new leadership from within the New York black community. Although black Americans were often blocked from becoming skilled tradesmen, its graduates still represented many of the most important and influential African-American figures of the period. They entered into careers in medicine, the clergy, scholarship, abolitionism, theater and business. Among some of the better known students are: Alexander Crummell, Peter Guignon, Iris Aldridge, James McCune Smith, Samuel Ringgold Ward, Peter Williams and Patrick Reason. </p>  </bioghist>
