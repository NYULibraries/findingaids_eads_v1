    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Louise Gugino Shanberg was a leader and an organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA), from 1929 to 1944. She worked with another well-known organizer and woman leader in the ACWA, Dorothy Bellanca.</p><p>The Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers, was a residential educational program for working women offered by the elite women's college, Bryn Mawr, in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, during summers from 1921 to 1938. It served both organized and unorganized workers, and a national, and even a small international, constituency. Although there were numbers of other educational programs and schools for workers during throughout the United States in this same period, the Bryn Mawr program, created at the behest of the college's charismatic president, M. Carey Thomas, had a distinctive feminist cast not found in other labor programs and colleges.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>Three black and white images make up this collection-three are 5x7 black and white copy prints of snapshots, another three are slides shot of the same images. The images-informal shots of young women in summer attire--were shot outdoors at the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers. They may include shots of Shanberg herself, but none has any captions or identifications that confirm this.</p>  </scopecontent>
