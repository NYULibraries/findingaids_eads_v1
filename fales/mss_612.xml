    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection contains websites associated with No Longer Empty. The website mostly contains descriptions of its exhibits dating back to 2009, images of works from the exhibits, and artist biographies. The organization also held education programs, such as the No Longer Empty Curatorial Lab (NLE Lab), a professional development program for emerging curators and cultural workers; the WorkRoom (formerly No Longer Bored), an afternoon art-making workshop series designed for children, families and community elders to discover and explore NLE art exhibitions; the ART ZONE: Community Art and Data Lab, an intergenerational and collaborative learning opportunity that brings together teens and elders to form a think-tank with artists and designers to research how local histories can be amplified by the arts; Young Exhibition Makers; and the Youth Action Council. The website also includes news and events from the organization. The website also features programming related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which also led to the closure of the organization.</p><p>The Young Exhibition Makers and Youth Action Council were education programs created by No Longer Empty. Young Exhibition Makers (Y.Ex) was an exhibition and curatorial learning program for youth ages 14-19, led by Curator-Artist-Educator Catherine Feliz. The program focused on curation, art, and social justice literacy, as well as professional development. In 2020,  Y.Ex began with a focus on mental health and disability activism, which led into the virtual exhibition curated by the youth in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Youth Action Council (YAC) was a program for youth, ages 14-19, to explore the intersections between art and social justice, led by Curator-Artist-Educator, Augustina Warton. The program focused on diversity, equity, and cultivating socio-political literacy and professional development, with all activities based on grassroots activism, communication, and critical thinking. In 2020, due the COVID-19 pandemic, the program pivoted to virtual meetings where the youth worked to specifically address the current pandemic through creating NLE NYCapsule. THe website contains cohort biographies, artist biographies, curatorial statements, the digital exhibition, reflections from he NYCApsule, and informational catalogs. The collection also includes the websites for the 2018-2019 YAC cohort and the Y.Ex exhibit, InJustUs, from June 2019.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>No Longer Empty was an arts organization that "curates site-responsive exhibitions, education and public programs in unconventional locations around New York City." Its first exhibit was at the Chelsea Hotel in 2009. Their education programs were established in circa 2012, as the Youth Docent Program (Y.DOT), which offered high school students in New York City professional training in staging an exhibition. In 2014, they established the  Young Curators Program (Y.Lab). In 2018, these youth programs were merged into the Young Exhibition Makers (Y.Ex), a year-long program that trains and pays teenager in exhibition making from curation to management. In 2013, the  No Longer Empty Curatorial Lab (NLE Lab) was established for merging curators and cultural workers to get direct experience in the field. In July 2020, the organization ceased programming, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>  </bioghist>
