            <abstract id="ref2" label="Abstract">Camp Kinderland was founded on Sylvan Lake in Hopewell Junction, NY in 1923 by members of the Workmen’s Circle who worked in the organization’s New York City schools. The camp’s founders sought to create a summer youth camp that would not only provide a recreational escape for the children of working people from the tenements of New York City, but also one whose culture would encourage and foster a commitment to socially progressive activism and the embracing of a rich Jewish secular tradition. The camp's founders, including some activists in the Communist Party, were associated with the left wing of the Workermen's Circle. From 1930 the Camp operated under the auspices of a branch of the International Workers order. In the 1950s, under the pressure of New York State "anti-subversive" investigations, it was incorporated independently. The collection contains administrative records (including legal and financial records, property and maintenance files, registration and membership records), files relating to Camp Kinderland's cultural programs both in and out of season, publicity materials, oral histories, and photographic and audiovisual materials.</abstract>

            <p>Camp Kinderland was founded on Sylvan Lake in Hopewell Junction, NY in 1923 by members of The Workmen’s Circle who worked in the organization’s New York City Schools. The camp’s founders sought to create a summer youth camp that would not only provide a recreational escape for the children of working people from the tenements of New York City, but also encourage and foster a commitment to socially progressive activism and the embracing of a rich Jewish secular tradition. Responding to a growing demand from parents of campers and other visitors, many of whom had already taken to sleeping on dining-hall floors, Kinderland would quickly establish an adult wing, Camp Lakeland.</p>
            <p>Both the youth and adult camps provide summer recreation opportunities found at most camps. Recreational activities include swimming, hiking, camping and outdoor sports, as well as cultural activities such as music, drama, dance and the arts. The camp’s culture is both officially and informally grounded in the Jewish tradition of progressive activism, with its core values of peace, social justice, activism, civil rights, Yiddishkeit, and friendship.</p>
            <p>From less than one hundred campers in its first year, Camp Kinderland grew quickly, and by 1933 close to 500 children filled over thirty bungalows and tent groupings. In 1930, the leftist wing of the Workmen’s Circle, along with Camp Kinderland, split off to form the International Worker’s Order (IWO). The Camp was formally sponsored by the Jewish People’s Fraternal Order of the IWO. Although New York State declared the IWO a “Communist-allied” organization in 1954 and revoked its charter, Camp Kinderland was able to continue by incorporating independently. Kinderland did come under scrutiny from the FBI as a Communist-affiliated organization, and its manager, David Greene, was called to testify before the House Committee on Unamerican Activites in 1955.</p>
            <p>In 1971, after years of increasing county taxes and declining numbers of campers, the board and directors sold the Camp’s property in Hopewell Junction and relocated to a rented property in Fitchville, Connecticut. After five years of renting sites for the Camp in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and New York, Kinderland purchased property in 1976 in Tolland, Massachusetts. In the same year camp was re-incorporated by the state of NY, with offices at 1 Union Square in Manhattan. Among the prominent participants in the Camp's cultural program have been Paul Robeson and Pete Seeger, and notable alumni include Chesa Boudin, Jules Dassin, Max Kellerman, Spencer Ackerman and Marisa Tomei.</p>

            <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
            <p>Due to the fragile nature of the original materials, researchers must use the digitized versions of the glass negatives in Boxes 27-30.</p>
            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item's original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection's finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@library.nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

                    <p>This series contains property records for the various camp sites which Kinderland called home. Together the folders provide a narrative of sorts for the camp’s location over the years; its origins at Hopewell Junction’s Sylvan Lake, from 1923 to 1971, the closing of that property and the inter-site years, when Kinderland spent Summers in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, and finally, the settlement of the camp at it’s current home in Tolland, Massachusetts, in 1976. This series also contains maintenance records related to the physical and structural caretaking of the camp site and construction projects. In large part, this material relates to the building of a new and extensive dining hall in Tolland, beginning around 1994 and completed for use in the Summer of 1998.</p>

                    <p>Series IV contains office records for registration of campers and staff, and more general records for membership to the camp, including records of enrollment, hiring, and directories of campers. Of note is a file on the "Chris Nelson Scholarship Fund," created in memory of a camper killed in an automobile accident on his way home from camp. Beginning in the 1970s this fund was used to provide financial aid to send children to Kinderland.</p>

                    <p>Series V contains material and records related to Kinderland's cultural activities. Files include programs for the Olympics, a competitive athletic activity held annually in place of “color wars” or track meets. The series also includes reading materials, performance pieces and plays, song sheets, records of past projects for use by campers and staff, journals, camp-produced newsletters, trip logs, letters, records of exercises and activities, and art projects. The journal folders, which contain large sections in Yiddish, provide an intimate view of the character of the camp and the people who participated in it over the years.</p>

                    <p>Series VII contains materials related to Kinderland activities, events, and programs conducted outside of the summer season. In the first part are the records of some of the Camp’s many reunions, which often served as fundraisers to benefit the Camp. In these files are the records of three large reunions, held on Kinderland’s 56th, 60th, and 75th anniversaries. Also in this series are the records of Kinderland cultural and recreational events; dances, protests and demonstrations, film screenings, and Passover seders among them.

                    <p>This series primarily contains black-and-white and color photographs, slides, glass plate negatives, and photographic negatives that document camp facilities, camp activities, and the staff and campers themselves. The series also includes an original pen and ink cartoon and various original and laser copies of posters and other graphic materials related to the camp's 75th anniversary and other events in the camp's history, possibly used for the anniversary exhibit. Also of note are reproductions of murals on various radical and labor history topics, created by Camp Kinderland campers and staff and published in the late 1990s and 2000s.</p>
                    <p>This series also contains oral history interviews with former campers and recordings of camp plays and other activities on a variety of audiovisual formats.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains glass plate negatives from the summer of 1935 at Camp Kinderland, with some images from 1936. The majority of the images depict groups at the camp, many of which have no identifying information. Most of the description for the images are in Yiddish, with some English. Some significant events shown in the images include the camp's morning salute, a visit to the camp from Robert Minor, and the erection of the Lenin statue on the property.</p>

                    <p>Camp Kinderland was founded on Sylvan Lake in Hopewell Junction, NY in 1923 by members of the Workmen’s Circle who worked in the organization’s New York City schools. The camp’s founders sought to create a summer youth camp that would not only provide a recreational escape for the children of working people from the tenements of New York City, but also one whose culture would encourage and foster a commitment to socially progressive activism and the embracing of a rich Jewish secular tradition. The website contains news and event listings, camper and parent resources, and information about renting their facilities.</p>
