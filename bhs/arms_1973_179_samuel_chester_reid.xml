    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Samuel Chester Reid (1783-1861) was born in Norwich, CT.  He served in the Navy in the War of 1812, for which he was regarded as a national hero.  After resigning from the Navy, Reid moved to New York, N.Y., where he published the <emph render="italic">New York Telegraph and Signal Book</emph> and was appointed harbor master in 1843.  Reid is also credited for designing the stars and stripes scheme to the American flag, which Congress adopted in 1818.  Reid died in New York City and was buried in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery in an unmarked grave.  A memorial monument marking the site of his grave was erected and dedicated in 1956.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
