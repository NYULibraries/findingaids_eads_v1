            <head>Historical note</head>
            <p>The Brooklyn Home for Aged Men was founded by a group of wealthy Brooklyn women as a charitable foundation to provide housing and care for impoverished elderly men in 1877. It was officially incorporated on February 27, 1878. The organization then secured temporary housing on Grand Avenue, before finding its first permanent residence at 84 State Street. That house was filled to capacity by 1880. By September 1886, property was acquired and ground was broken for a new residence home at 745 Classon Avenue. Residents were moved from the State Street home to Classon Avenue in May 1887. In 1893, a home on Park Place was acquired and joined to the organization's main building. In 1894, the Board of Managers decided to allow couples to be admitted to the Home, the first of which arrived in 1895. Later, single women would also be allowed to reside in the Home. Additional buildings and medical facilities were constructed throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
            <p>The Home ceased operation as a residence in 1969, largely as a result of increased regulation of elderly care facilities. Current residents were transferred to other facilities. The Home's assets were sold, including real estate property (to the Interfaith Medical Center) and works of art. Funds from the sales were invested and are now used to support other elderly care facilities. The organization also provides scholarships for nursing students, and supports medical research.</p>

            <p>Folder titles which were created by the processing archivist are enclosed in brackets. Three bound volumes of annual reports, six loose annual reports, and an eighty-year anniversary pamhplet were added to the collection by John Zarrillo in December 2015. These items were originally part of the Brooklyn charitable organizations for the aged publications collection (1985.105), but had been separated from that collection at some point in the past and were never processed.</p>

                        <emph render="bold">Photographs series</emph> contains photographic prints and negatives, postcards, and digital images, dating from around the 1920s to the 2000s. Subjects include the Brooklyn Home for Aged Men building, residents, board members, and celebrations.</p>
                    <p>The series includes 78 digital images (JPEG format), as well as two digital documents (Word files), which were stored on CD-ROMs. The files primarily contain images of residents and board members (circa 1950s-1960s), the home's 1878 Certificate of Incorporation, and images of the Nancy K. Munson Memorial Foundation (circa 2009). The digital files were transfered to the CD-ROMs in 2005 and 2011. The digital documents have been printed and are available in the History folder of the 
                        <emph render="bold">Administrative and financial records series</emph>. Some digital images are copies of prints found in this series.</p>
