            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Edgar Lawrence Doctorow was born in New York City on January 6, 1931. He grew up on Eastburn Avenue in the Bronx and attended the Bronx High School of Science, where he showed an early interest in the arts evidenced by the inclusion of a poem, short story, and painting in his high school literary journal, 
                <title render="italic">Dynamo</title>. These interests were further developed at Kenyon College, where he shared the stage with Paul Newman and the page with fellow poet, James Wright. Doctorow graduated with honors from Kenyon College in 1952, receiving a B.A in Philosophy, before continuing with a year of graduate work at Columbia University. He married Helen Seltser amidst a two-year stint in the U.S. Army (1953-55); they had three children: Jenny, Caroline, and Richard.</p>
            <p>After a brief period as a reservations clerk at LaGuardia Airport, Doctorow's early professional career encompassed a variety of occupations closely related to the arts. He began as a staff reader for Columbia Pictures and CBS Television (1956-1959) writing synopses and reader's reports for books considered as potential movie concepts. During this time, he experimented in multiple literary genres, producing a collection of short fiction, plays, and television scripts; however, it was his first novel, 
                <title render="italic">Welcome to Hard Times</title> (1960), that proved most successful. 
                <title render="italic">Welcome to Hard Times</title> was the product of his experience at Columbia Pictures, as he later told an interviewer: "I had to suffer one lousy western after another, and it occurred to me that I could lie about the West in a much more interesting way than any of these people were lying." 
                <title render="italic">Welcome to Hard Times</title> was itself later adapted into a movie starring Henry Fonda.</p>
            <p>From 1959-1964, Doctorow served as senior editor for the New American Library, and from 1964-1969 as the editor in chief of Dial Press. During this time he wrote his second novel, 
                <title render="italic">Big As Life</title> (1966), in which he turned once again to a seemingly banal genre, this time science fiction, in order to set a satire in a future New York. The result was less successful. Doctorow admits that it is "a rather weak book," and it has not been reissued since its original publication.</p>
            <p>Since 1969, Doctorow has devoted his time to writing and teaching. He has been associated with several colleges and universities, including the University of California, Irvine; Sarah Lawrence College; Yale University Drama School; and Princeton University; however, he has made his permanent home at New York University where he holds the Glucksman Chair in American Letters. He is also a member of P.E.N American Center and was appointed as a member to the American Academy and National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1984.</p>
            <p>Doctorow's third novel, 
                <title render="italic">The Book of Daniel</title> (1971), won critical acclaim and a nomination for a National Book Award. 
                <title render="italic">The Book of Daniel</title> is a fictionalized account of the Rosenberg children whose lives are haunted by the Atom Spy Trials of their parents and by the general paranoia introduced into American culture during the McCarthy-era. The book was adapted into a movie in 1983 directed by Sidney Lumet.</p>
            <p>
                <title render="italic">Ragtime</title> (1975), written while Doctorow was a Guggenheim fellow and a Creative Artists Service fellow, started as one of the most highly anticipated and critically acclaimed novels of 1976 and ended by being one of the fastest selling and most popular books of all time. 
                <title render="italic">Ragtime</title> is an historical novel in that it takes place in an historical period (the first decade of the twentieth century) and uses historical figures as characters (Houdini, J.P. Morgan, Emma Goldman, and many others); however, its particular charm is the way in which it interweaves these personalities with a fictional narrative in order to expose the nascent lurking of a more ominous political and cultural threat that is always central to Doctorow's general critique of American life. This technique of commingling fact and fiction was sometimes interpreted as a departure from reality; yet Doctorow was always quick to defend the novelist's right to imagination: "What's real and what isn't? I used to know but I've forgotten. Let's just say that Ragtime is a mingling of fact and invention—a novelist's revenge on an age that celebrates nonfiction" . 
                <title render="italic">Ragtime</title> received the first National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction in 1976 as well as the Arts and Letters Award given by the American Academy and National Institute of Arts and Letters. Ragtime was later adapted into a movie directed by Robert Altman and a Broadway musical.</p>
            <p>Three of Doctorow's subsequent novels are set in the 1930s, though each has its own perspective on that troubled time: 
                <title render="italic">Loon Lake</title> (1980) is the story of a young man who cast adrift during the Depression years; 
                <title render="italic">World's Fair</title> (1986) is a memoir of a 1930s New York City boyhood; and 
                <title render="italic">Billy Bathgate</title> (1989) explores the underground of gangsterism and crime. 
                <title render="italic">Loon Lake</title> was a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and was nominated for the National Book Award; 
                <title render="italic">World's Fair</title> was the winner of the 1986 National Book Award; 
                <title render="italic">Billy Bathgate</title> was the winner of the 1990 P.E.N./Faulkner Award and was adapted into a movie by Tom Stoppard directed by Robert Benton. Doctorow's other projects include two additional novels, 
                <title render="italic">The Waterworks</title> (1994) and 
                <title render="italic">City of God</title> (2000), a play, 
                <title render="italic">Drinks Before Dinner</title> (1979) that was first produced by Joseph Papp under the direction of Mike Nichols, and a collection of short fiction, 
                <title render="italic">Lives of the Poets</title> (1984). Additionally, Doctorow has written a number of non-fiction pieces for various periodicals, including 
                <title render="italic">The New York Times</title>, 
                <title render="italic">The Nation</title>, 
                <title render="italic">Newsday</title>, 
                <title render="italic">Playboy</title>, 
                <title render="italic">Harper's</title>, and 
                <title render="italic">The New Yorker</title>. In 1993, Doctorow published a collection of these non-fiction pieces in 
                <title render="italic">Jack London, Hemingway, and the Constitution</title>.</p>
