    <head>Biographic Note</head>
<p>Jim Neu (1943-2010) was an American playwright and actor, based in New York City, who was best known for his experimental plays. Neu was born in Brooklyn on November 18, 1943. He graduated from the State University of New York at Oneonta in the early 1960s and was then drafted into the U.S. Army. Instead of being sent to fight in Vietnam, Neu was stationed in Korea. After being discharged in 1967, he moved to Manhattan's Lower East Side and between 1970 and 1975, Neu performed with Robert Wilson's Byrd Hoffman School of Byrds. </p><p>In 1976, Neu briefly re-located to California and alongside his friend and collaborator, sk dunn, he began creating works for the Napa Valley Theater Company (NVTC). While at the NVTC, Neu also collaborated with composer Michael Galasso and choreographer Liz Pasquale. Together they created one of Neu's notable plays, <emph render="italic">Echo Ranch</emph>, in 1977. This piece was later performed at the Green St. Gallery and PS 1 in New York City. </p><p>Neu returned to New York City in the late 1970s and began to collaborate with several downtown Manhattan performance spaces including the Kitchen, the Westbeth Theater, PS122's Avant-Garde-Arama, and the Soho Reperatory Theatre. He also began to participate in theater festivals in both the United States and in Europe. In 1991, Neu became friends with Ellen Stewart, founder of the La MaMa Experimental Theater Club, and began his long-term working relationship with La MaMa.</p><p>Over the course of his career, Neu wrote many plays including <emph render="italic">Him or Me</emph> (1979), <emph render="italic">Basic Behavior</emph> (1982), <emph render="italic">Duet for Spies</emph> (1987), <emph render="italic">The Floatones</emph> (1995), <emph render="italic">Mondo Beyondo</emph> (1997), and <emph render="italic">Target Audience</emph> (2003) -- many of which were staged at La MaMa. He also wrote screenplays for two films, <emph render="italic">Doomed Loved</emph> (1983) and <emph render="italic">The Big Blue</emph> (1988), both of which were directed by Andrew Horne and premiered at the Berlin Film Festival. </p><p>Between 1985-1987, Neu was the receipient of a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship and a New York Foundation for the Arts Playwriting Fellowship. In 1994 he was awarded a New Works grant by the New York State Council on the Arts and spent time at Andy's Summer Playhouse in New Hampshire mentoring young playwrights. In 2000, he was awarded an Arts International performance grant for the Exodus Festival in Lljubljana, Slovenia and conducted a playwriting workshop at the Mladinsko Theater.  </p><p>Jim Neu died on July 19, 2010 from lung cancer. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Jim Neu Papers (1960-2012) contain materials created and collected by Neu and focus largely on his theatrical career. The collection contains documents relating to many of Neu's plays including: <emph render="italic">Echo Ranch</emph> (1977), <emph render="italic">Aerobia</emph> (2001), <emph render="italic">Basic Behavior</emph> (1982), <emph render="italic">An Evening with Jesse James</emph> (1988), <emph render="italic">Him or Me</emph> (1979), <emph render="italic">Duet for Spies</emph> (1987), <emph render="italic">The Floatones</emph> (1995), <emph render="italic">Mondo Beyondo</emph> (1997), <emph render="italic">Mutual Narcissism</emph> (1984), <emph render="italic">Live Witness</emph> (1992), <emph render="italic">Kiss Shot</emph> (2002), <emph render="italic">Target Audience</emph> (2003), <emph render="italic">Optissimo Lounge</emph> (1991), 
<emph render="italic">La Vie Noir</emph> (2007) and more. The collection also contains documents relating to Neu's two films  <emph render="italic">Doomed Loved</emph> (1983) and <emph render="italic">The Big Blue</emph> (1988). </p><p>These materials include drafts and finished copies of plays and screenplays; drafts of unfinished of plays; promotional materials for his works such as posters, flyers, performance cards, programs; print and digital photographs, as well as slides of performances; recordings of Neu's productions; correspondence and reviews; research materials for Neu's plays; and administrative papers such as performance logistics, finances for his plays, and grant funding. Together, these materials demonstrate Neu's active participation within the experimental theater community, the types of theatrical productions he participated in as an actor and playwright, his artistic style, and the venues he had relationships with in New York City and beyond. </p><p>The collection also contains the works of some of Neu's friends and collaborators including sk dunn, Mike Galasso, Andrew Horne, Ed Leighton, John Nesci, and Lenny Pickett. </p><p>Neu was heavily influenced by jazz music and often incorporated elements of it into his works. To this effect, the collection contains research materials focused on jazz and musicians including Duke Ellington. In addition to jazz recordings, the collection contains audiocassettes and videocassettes with interviews, music, and sound effects that were most likely used in Neu's performances. All of these have been listed with the original titles found on their containers. </p><p>In addition to Neu's plays, the collection contains materials related to writing workshops he participated in both domestically and internationally; notebooks, and agenda books; and personal correspondence. These materials represent Neu's life outside of his plays. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The Jim Neu Papers (1960-2012) were arranged and described by an archivist in the summer of 2023. Materials were placed in new archival folders and boxes. Original folder titles were retained when possible. Materials were grouped together thematically and then arranged alphabetically by file title. Photographs and slides were removed from their original housing and placed into archival sleeves. 320 audiovisual items were assigned a unique AV identifing number, rehoused into archival boxes, and intellectually incorporated into the finding aid. Audiovisual materials have been listed with the original titles found on their containers. </p><p>Duplicate materials were removed from the collection and returned to the donor.</p><p>New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content. Three optical discs containing documents and photographs were forensically imaged and analyzed using FTK, six optical discs containing audio files were forensically imaged and analyzed using Exact Audio Copy, and 50 optical discs containing video files were forensically imaged and analyzed using Isobusters Pro. </p>  </processinfo>
