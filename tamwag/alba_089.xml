            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Stanley Postek (1912-1991) was a sailor, prizefighter and union organizer who went to Spain in 1938 to fight in the Spanish Civil War. After being seriously injured, Postek was detained in a concentration camp in France before returning to New York. Postek later served in World War II as a merchant seaman. The collection consists of materials, including personal journals, from Postek's time in Spain and afterward and from his period of service as a merchant marine in World War II. Later papers include newspaper articles and other writings about aspects of the Spanish Civil War, memorial items about veterans, and material documenting Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) activities.</abstract>

            <p>The Stanley Postek Collection was donated to Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives in the early 1990s by Postek's daughter, Judi Darnell. This collection came to New York University in January 2001 as part of the original acquisition of ALBA collections, formerly housed at Brandeis University.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Born Ladislaus Ferdinand Szeliga in 1912 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Stanley Postek adopted his cousin's name when he ran away from home as a teenager. He left school in the mid-thirties to become a sailor and union organizer for the International Seamen's Union of America, and a founding member of the breakaway National Maritime Union. In 1937 Postek became a light heavyweight boxing champion. In May 1938, he sailed to Europe to join the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War.</p>
            <p>In Spain Postek was initially assigned to the Canadian Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion, and subsequently transferred to a machine-gun company of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion. He was seriously injured in August 1938. When the International Brigades were evacuated that November, Postek, who was in a hospital, was left behind. In January 1939, he walked over the border into France and was immediately detained in the Argeles-sur-Mer concentration camp, where he almost died of septicemia. A week later, Postek managed to escape from the camp with the help of a journalist from the Paris Herald Tribune. Without a passport or any identification, Postek spent a period of rehabilitation in a Paris hospital, and finally returned to New York as a stowaway in May 1939.</p>
            <p>Postek served in World War II as a merchant seaman, most notably on the Murmansk Run. After the war, he joined the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. He was one of 2,000 seamen barred from employment by the Coast Guard during the Korean War for his association with the Communist Party. Postek later worked as an extra in the entertainment business, notably as a longshoreman in the Elia Kazan film, "On the Waterfront." After he retired, Postek worked with the Marine Worker's Historical Association, as well as teaching several college courses. In the 1960s he ran a successful macramé shop in Greenwich Village, the Rope Gallery, adapting his sailor's knot-tying expertise to a new craft.</p>
            <p>Postek died in 1991 at his home in San Diego, California.</p>
