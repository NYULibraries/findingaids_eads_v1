    <abstract id="aspace_884f4d2a6227e3b7a0734710933714f8">Mortimer Daniel Rubin (1931-2015) was a prominent member of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). He held many leadership positions in the Communist Party including National Youth Secretary, National Organizational Secretary, Head of the Department of Economic and Social Rights, and Education Secretary. His papers provide a broad view of Rubin's political life and his work within the Communist Party, documenting how his personal and intellectual life were heavily intertwined with his political activism. They consist of national Communist Party administrative files documenting his leadership position within the Party, including correspondence, meeting minutes, memoranda, bulletins, notes, drafts of essays and official Party statements, educational course outlines, and collected articles and pamphlets. The collection also contains files related to Rubin's split from the CPUSA in 1991 and his involvement in the creation of the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Other files document Rubin's work after he renewed his Communist Party membership in 2000.</abstract>

    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>This collection is arranged into five series, which reflect Daniel Rubin's work and leadership roles within the Communist Party of the United States. Materials in Series I-IV are arranged by Communist Party departments: Series I: National Organizational Department, Series II: Youth Commission, Series III: Economic and Social Rights Commission, and Series IV: Education Department, which Rubin led at different times during his membership. Inclusion of materials in these series, however, is not exclusively limited to the years he directed these departments as he contributed to efforts of various departments even when he was not in a leadership position. Series I: National Organizational Department has been further divided into subseries to reflect major functions of the national Party work: Subseries I.A: General Files, Subseries I.B: Clubs and Districts, Subseries I.C: Conventions, Subseries I.D: Elections, and Subseries I.E: National Council and National Committee Meetings. Series V: Post 1991 Spilt, documents Rubin's political work in the years following the major rupture in the Communist Party at the 1991 National Convention.</p>  </arrangement>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Mortimer Daniel Rubin (1931-2015) was a prominent member of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). Rubin was born in Philadelphia, PA in 1931. Better known as Daniel Rubin, he was raised in a Jewish, communist household and involved in progressive and communist activism from an early age. In 1947 he joined the Progressive Citizens of America and was founding member of the Young Progressives of America. He attended Swarthmore College where he joined Citizens for a Free City College, as well as American Youth for Democracy, a Communist Party affiliated youth organization. He began law school at University of Pennsylvania in 1953 and in that year became one of three members in the Eastern-Pennsylvania Labor Youth League. Rubin attended his first CPUSA convention in 1956 as a delegate to the 16th National Convention. In that year, he became a board member of the CPUSA's Philadelphia district and the district's Youth Secretary. In 1959 Rubin was elected to the National Committee of the CPUSA and invited to move to New York to become the organization's National Youth Secretary, a position he held until 1964. Rubin became the Party's National Organizational Secretary in 1964, a position he held until 1974. Rubin was deeply involved in CPUSA national work until 1991, serving as head of the Department of Economic and Social Rights from 1974 to 1980, and Educational Director from 1981 to 1992. Following the 1991 National Convention, Rubin and several other prominent members split from the Party and formed the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Rubin renewed his membership with CPUSA in 2000 and remained an active member until his death in 2015. During these years his work focused primarily on club and district organizing in Brooklyn and New York State.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Materials in the collection have been rehoused and arranged by the archivist. The bulk of the collection was originally housed in folders created by Rubin. All original folders have been replaced, and many folders with vague or general titles have been modified by the archivist to provide clarity and specificity. Original folder titles have been retained where possible. The collection has been arranged by the archivist to reflect Rubin's involvement with the Communist Party and his leadership roles within the organization.</p><p>A portion of this collection was damaged by mold and pests. Several boxes of the mold damaged materials were appraised by the curator and deaccessioned. Records of higher value have been retained, and cleaned by the archivist or a vendor. Cleaned materials that were exposed to pests and mold have been clearly labeled to notify researchers of any potential health hazards.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Daniel Rubin Papers (dated 1940s-2015) provide a broad view of Daniel Rubin's political life and his work within the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA). Daniel Rubin's papers document how his personal and intellectual life were heavily intertwined with his political activism, and in particular his work for the Party. Most well represented among his papers are files from Rubin's work as National Organizational Secretary and his work with national organizational bodies of the Party such as the National Committee and the National Board. Also well represented in his papers are correspondence, reports, and organizing files related to his leadership of the Youth Commission, the Economic and Social Rights Commission, and the Education Department. The collection also contains files related to Rubin's split from the CPUSA in 1991 and his involvement in the creation of the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Other files document Rubin's work after he renewed his Communist Party membership in 2000. During that time, Rubin worked to strengthen the CPUSA's Brooklyn Club and served as a member of the New York District Executive Committee and the CPUSA National Committee. These materials consist of National Party correspondence, minutes, memoranda, bulletins, notes, drafts of essays and official Party statements, educational course outlines, and collected articles and pamphlets. Rubin was deeply also interested in the history of Judaism and communism, and his papers dated after 1991 include extensive research files on international Jewish issues and the role of Jews in Communist Party.</p>  </scopecontent>

National bodies documented in this subseries include the National Board, National Committee, Central Committee, National Council, Political Committee, and Program Committee. In several files the Central Committee and National Council meetings overlap. The Central Committee was the leading body of the Communist Party and responsible for the development of Party policy.

DuBois Clubs, Labor Youth League, Progressive Youth Organizing Committee, Young Communist League, and Young Workers Liberation League, dated 1940s-1980s. Files related to Rubin's work with youth organizations, notably his work at Swarthmore College and involvement in the American Youth for Democracy (AYD) and Labor Youth League (LYL) predate his membership in the Communist Party. While the AYD and LYL were Communist Party affiliated organizations, Rubin's files on these organizations specifically relate to youth organizing in the Philadelphia area. The bulk of the series document Rubin's work as National Youth Secretary, but also include Youth Commission materials dated after Rubin's work as Youth Secretary. These materials include reports, meeting minutes, outlines, educational guides, and publications related to the Youth Commission and affiliated organization, the Young Communist League and Young Workers Liberation League dated as late as 1990.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_7e5d32587f33e549592be2bd96d90aa0"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Files in this series are arranged alphabetically by organization name and topic.</p></arrangement><bioghist id="aspace_e4a413063d84f3ab0e0df84d059c283b"><head>Biographical / Historical</head><p>Daniel Rubin was raised in a communist household and was involved in progressive and communist activism from an early age. In 1947, he joined the Progressive Citizens of America and became a member of the Young Progressives of America. Around the same time, Rubin also joined the Philadelphia-based organization the Citizens for a Free City College, becoming the chair of the Youth Division and joined the Communist Party-affiliated American Youth for Democracy (AYD). As a student at Swarthmore College between 1949 and 1951, Rubin participated in Young Progressive for America political campaigns against McCarthyism, Cold War foreign policy, and segregation. He began law school at University of Pennsylvania in 1953 where he became a founding member of the Eastern Pennsylvania Labor Youth League (LYL). Between 1955 and 1960 Rubin began organizing for the Communist Party's Youth Club in Philadelphia, and served as a delegate to the 16th Convention of the Communist Party in 1956. He became the Party's National Youth Secretary in 1960, a position he held until the end of 1964.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_f07d0e8c2599a08ea79ad6ef36013ffb" level="file"><did><unittitle>American Youth for Democracy Publication: Youth</unittitle><unitdate normal="1945/1947" type="inclusive">1945-1947</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Files from the 1990s largely relate to his organizing work with the Committees of Correspondence (CoC) and include correspondence, flyers and position papers from the organization as well as legal brief and statements from a lawsuit between CoC members and the Communist Party. Papers dated after 2000, largely consist of correspondence, drafts of reports and essays, and collected articles related to Rubin's organizing work for both the CoC and the CPUSA. These materials primarily focus on Brooklyn Clubs and New York State regional organizing. The series includes approximately 1136 digital files related to Rubin's work with the both CPUSA and CoC organizing, dated 2006-2015. Other materials in this series include correspondence and petitions related to development of the Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn and resistance to the construction of the Barclay's Center stadium. The series also includes extensive research files on international Jewish issues and the role of Jews in Communist Party.</p><p>Born-digital records in this series consist of 3.5 gigabytes of emails, documents, and image files, which document Rubin's continued involvement in the CPUSA and his activism in local New York City politics. These files include drafts of Rubin's 2009 book, <emph render="italic">Can Capitalism Last: A Marxist Update</emph>; outlines, emails, and meeting notes from national, district, and local CPUSA organizing activities; and flyers, correspondence, and photos documenting Rubin's involvement in progressive political campaigns in Brooklyn and New York City. Rubin also saved biographical articles and obituaries honoring prominent Communist Party members. These biographical files include newspaper articles as well as transcripts of speeches honoring deceased Party members that Rubin collected for memorial events, the bulk of which are written about former Communist Party chairman Henry Winston.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_42b3eb2ce889cd007e53d1f56cccaced"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Files in this series are arranged alphabetically by name of organization and topic.</p></arrangement><bioghist id="aspace_e2a767b7157d1d61b0a788639cbbaab7"><head>Biographical / Historical</head><p>Daniel Rubin left the Communist Party in 1991 along with many other Party members following political disagreements presented at the Party's 25th National Convention. Dissenting members formed the Committees of Correspondence, which later named the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. Beginning in 1992, Rubin and several other former Communist Party members were sued by the Communist Party over the wills of Rachel Freidenberg and Rosalind Tratchenberg who had bequeathed money to individual Party members. Party leadership claimed that money bequeathed by Freidenberg and Tratchenberg were intended for Communist Party and disputed Rubin's and other former member's intention to donate funds to the Committees of Correspondence. The cases were eventually settled in the late 1990s. Rubin renewed his membership in the Communist Party in 2000 and remained an active member in the party until his death in 2015.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_183e5a6697696aee4e761af2278debcf" level="file"><did><unittitle>African American Equality</unittitle><unitdate normal="1989/1999" type="inclusive">1989-1999</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
