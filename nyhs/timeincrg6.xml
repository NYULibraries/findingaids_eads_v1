			<head>Historical Note</head>
			<p>The office of Editor-in-Chief did not exist at the formation of Time Inc. since the company initially had only <title render="italic">Time</title> as its major publication. Cofounders Henry R. Luce and Briton Hadden were both listed on the <title render="italic">Time</title> masthead as editors from 1923 through Hadden's death in 1929. Though both were listed, their agreement in practice was to swap positions as the heads of editorial and business. </p>
			<p>After Hadden's death, John S. Martin became the managing editor of <title render="italic">Time</title> with Luce listed above him as editor. According to Robert T. Elson, writer of the authorized history of Time Inc., Luce was using the title of editor-in-chief in 1938 when he resigned as Time Inc.'s president and chief operating officer, but retained his roles as board chairman and editor-in-chief. </p>
			<p>According to Time Inc.'s history on the company intranet, Luce restructured the management of the magazines in 1937, giving each a publisher, a managing editor, and an advertising director. This restructuring established the separation of the business side from the editorial side, respectively referred to as church and state by staff. Luce formalized these roles and the importance of separating them in a 1938 memo entitled "The Principles, Policies, Attitudes Etc. Which Govern and Motivate Time Inc." It is possible this restructuring is when Luce took on the title Editor-in-Chief although he isn't listed as such on magazine mastheads or in the annual reports until the 1940s. According to the intranet, Luce wrote a note to Hedley Donovan, his pick for next editor-in-chief, in 1962 reiterating the necessity of the independence of the office.</p>
			<p>Editor-in-Chief was the top editorial position at Time Inc., overseeing editorial policies and standards for all titles and divisions including magazines, books and newspapers. The entire editorial side reported up to this position, and the editor-in-chief reported directly to the board. The publishing/business side reported up to top business executive which became the chief executive officer around 1960. In 1978, shortly before his retirement, Donovan presented a statement to the board to precisely define the role of editor-in-chief so that the office would be preserved for future holders. This statement was formally adopted as company policy in December 1978. In April 1986, succeeding Editor-in-Chief Henry Grunwald further updated the definition of the title in a statement to the board, a copy of which is in Ray Cave's files. </p>
			<p>After the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications in 1990 when the magazine and books divisions became subsidiaries, the editor-in-chief began reporting to the head of Time Warner blurring the editorial and publishing/business separation. In 2014 when Time Inc. disaffiliated from Time Warner, the editor-in-chief was replaced by the chief content officer reporting to the chief executive officer which removed the separation altogether.</p>

					<head>Biographical Note</head>
					<p>Hedley Donovan was the second editor-in-chief of Time Inc. from 1964 to 1979, a position previously held only by the company's cofounder Henry R. Luce.</p>
					<p> Donovan was a native of Minnesota and after graduating from the University of Minnesota, he spent three years at Oxford University studying history on a Rhodes scholarship. Instead of accepting a Harvard teaching assistant position, after graduation Donovan took the better paying job as a reporter at the Washington <title render="italic">Post</title> working on general and political assignments. During World War II, he served in Naval Intelligence. </p>
					<p>
						<title render="italic">Fortune</title> hired Donovan as a writer in 1945, promoting him to associate managing editor around 1950 and managing editor by 1953. In July 1959, Time Inc. announced Donovan's new position as editorial director, a deputy position to the editor-in-chief. While editorial director, Donovan established the Research and Development unit to conduct studies regarding Time Inc.'s ventures in television programming. In 1962, he was named to the board of directors. When Luce retired in April 1964, he recommended that the board appoint Donovan as his replacement. </p>
					<p> During his tenure as editor-in-chief, Donovan made the decision to suspend publishing of <title render="italic">Life</title> in 1972 for financial reasons and launched the magazines <title render="italic">Money</title> (1972) and <title render="italic">People</title> (1974). Under his supervision, the Magazine Development Group also considered other new magazine ideas: <title render="italic">Well</title>, regarding health topics; <title render="italic">Camera Month</title>; <title render="italic">View</title>, the description of which sounds like a precursor to <title render="italic">People</title>; and a women's magazine. Though the women's magazine received a title (<title render="italic">Woman</title>), and several years of work went into it, it was never realized. Time Inc. also acquired the Washington <title render="italic">Star</title> newspaper near the end of Donovan's tenure. </p>
					<p> In 1978, shortly before his retirement, Donovan presented a statement to the board to precisely define the role of editor-in-chief so that the office would be preserved for future holders. As transcribed in Prendergast and Colvin's book <title render="italic">The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise, 1960-1980</title>, he stated: "[The editor-in-chief] is responsible solely to the board for editorial content." "The board... delegates to the editor-in-chief the continuing appraisal and direction of the company's editorial work." "The editor-in-chief is a member of the board and of its executive committee." "The board does not expect the editor-in-chief to maintain the same immediate authority over the editorial work of Books and the [Washington] <title render="italic">Star</title> as he does over the magazines. He will, however, appoint the managing editor of Books and the editor of the <title render="italic">Star</title>..."</p>
					<p> His statement also defined the relationship of the editorial director as senior deputy to the editor-in-chief. This statement was formally adopted as company policy in December 1978.</p>
					<p> While preparing for retirement, Donovan recommended his replacement be Henry Grunwald with Ralph Graves as the editorial director. Donovan retired as editor-in-chief in June 1979. <title render="italic">F.Y.I.</title>, the Time Inc. staff newsletter published a special issue of articles about Donovan on June 4, 1979. Though officially retired from Time Inc., Donovan remained a consultant until at least 1985.</p>
					<p> After Donovan's retirement, he wanted to take some of his files in order to write his memoirs. Two sets of copies were made, one for the Archives and one for the researchers and writers working on the history of Time Inc. book. The original materials may be in the papers Donovan's family donated to the University Archives at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. </p>
					<p> Beginning in July 1979, Donovan served approximately one year as a White House senior advisor to President Jimmy Carter. In 1981, he was the visiting journalist at Harvard University, and in 1989 Donovan published his memoirs <title render="italic">Right Places, Right Times: Forty Years in Journalism, Not Counting My Paper Route</title>.</p>

						<p>The Appointment Books document Donovan Hedley's schedule, professional and personal, and many of the years contain multiple books. As some are marked "T. Lanz," these are probably the books of his schedule kept by his executive secretary Gertrude "Trudi" Lanz. Some are marked with "Mrs. Donovan" indicating they are his wife Dorothy Donovan's schedule. Books similar in appearance to the marked books are tentatively attributed to her. A few of the books from 1973 were removed from a tax audit accordion folder that also contained expense reports.</p>

						<head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
						<p>The Subject Files contain the majority of Donovan's correspondence and other office files and work product including remarks at board meetings; event invitations; press clippings; internal correspondence and memoranda; correspondent cables; and correspondence from former and future United States presidents along with Congress members, heads of companies, presidents and directors at universities, and other notable people. The Subject Files folders are frequently labeled on the front cover in handwriting which looks like Donovan's. Some of the files contain cross-reference sheets indicating the Time Inc. Archives completed some work.</p>
						<p> The files labeled as "1959-1979" and "1969-1978" are two groups of files that are labeled similarly to the alphabetical Subject Files and found together as folders and loose material. This might be material removed for research purposes, by Donovan or someone else, and not refiled into the original folders. Materials within each group have a loose topical relationship, and similar topics are in the alphabetically organized Subject Files. For "1959-1979" the majority of the materials were loose. The topics cover politics, United States presidents from Kennedy to Carter, and other politicians during this era. For "1969-1978" the majority of the materials were loose, and cover three topical areas: suspension of <title render="italic">Life</title>, research on the press, and speeches or talks. </p>
						<p> The miscellaneous files within the alphabetical run contain primarily correspondence along with article proposals, request for issues of magazines, complaints about facts in articles, thank yous, and memos regarding staff, correspondence with board members such as Sol M. Linowitz and Thomas J. Watson, Jr., and extensive correspondence from several notable people including Malcom Forbes, Gaylord Freeman, Jr., George McGhee, Arthur "Red" Motley, Elmo Roper, Dean Rusk, and John Volpe. Some items of note in the miscellaneous files include a letter from the U.S. Embassy regarding Mrs. Gandhi (in "B-Miscellaneous"); letters from Buckminster Fuller describing "Spaceship Earth"; and a letter from Florida senator Billy Graham regarding <title render="italic">Time</title>'s Black Panther articles. Even when there is a specific file on a person or event, additional records may be in the respective miscellaneous file, such as with Herman Nickel, John Oakes, Carl Solberg, and Cyrus Vance.</p>
						<p> In order to get background information on people or places and to stay apprised of current events and trends, Donovan utilized research assistants to write briefs on various topics. Briefs from <title render="italic">Time</title> reporter Dorothy "Dottie" Ferenbaugh are the most prevalent in Donovan's files. There are extensive research memos from Ferenbaugh in her own file as well as throughout the Subject Files on topics including: number of deaths of Black Panther party members due to encounters with the police; women's magazines; Time Inc. stockholders; summaries of <title render="italic">New York Times</title> articles; <title render="italic">Time</title>'s association with university curriculum; <title render="italic">Time</title>'s coverage of Guatemala; and the publishing industry.</p>
						<p> Other items of interest include the compiled critiques on <title render="italic">Time</title> from throughout the United States and Canada found in "Attitudes", and the specifics on Donovan's business meetings in the "Lunches and Dinners" files which contain attendee and special guest lists, invitations, agenda, and correspondence. </p>
						<p> The duplicate Subject Files may contain material not represented in the original alphabetical files although they include similar topics.</p>
					</scopecontent>
					<arrangement id="aspace_82d89de9b5695b34f86b3232f664827a">
						<head>Arrangement Note</head>
						<p>Organized into four groups: two groups of folders designated by date ranges, one run of original alphabetical folders, and one run of duplicate alphabetical folders. The groups of folders designated by date range are in the same order as they were in the Time Inc. archives, and the group names are from labels on the shelf or drawer where they were housed. The arrangement for the alphabetical files is based on the original order which alphabetized by topic.</p>

					<head>Biographical Note</head>
					<p>Henry Anatole Grunwald began his career at Time Inc. in 1944 as a copy boy and worked to the top editorial position of Editor-in-Chief. </p>
					<p> Grunwald emigrated to the United States from Austria in 1940 at the age of 17. After graduating from New York University in 1944, he began his first job at Time Inc. Grunwald held positions as a foreign correspondent from 1945 to 1951, <title render="italic">Time</title> Senior Editor from 1951 to 1966, <title render="italic">Time</title> Assistant Managing Editor from 1966 to 1968, <title render="italic">Time</title> Managing Editor from 1968 to 1977, Corporate Editor from 1977 to 1979, and finally was appointed as Editor-in-Chief in 1979 by his predecessor Hedley Donovan. He also served on Time Inc.'s board.</p>
					<p> During his tenure as Editor-in-Chief, Grunwald appointed the first woman managing editor of a major Time Inc. magazine when Patricia Ryan took over <title render="italic">People</title> in 1982.</p>
					<p> After retiring from Time Inc. President Ronald Reagan named him U.S. ambassador to Austria. Beginning in 1997, Grunwald published two memoirs, <title render="italic">One Man's America</title>, recounting his experiences as a Jewish refugee from Nazi-controlled Europe and success in his adopted country, and <title render="italic">Twilight: Losing Sight, Gaining Insight</title> about his degenerative loss of eyesight. In 2003, he published the novel <title render="italic">A Saint, More or Less</title>.</p>

					<p>The Henry Anatole Grunwald Files primarily are during his tenures as <title render="italic">Time</title> Managing Editor, Editorial Director, and Editor-in-Chief with some records from earlier in his career. Based on the accompanying archives transfer forms, all of Grunwald's files were transferred by his office while he was Editor-in-Chief. Therefore the records are not separated based on office and title, but kept in the series designated by his office on the transfer forms. Records include his internal and external correspondence, departmental files, files on Newstours he attended, speeches, and travel records.</p>

						<p>General Correspondence is primarily correspondence to and from people outside of the Time Inc. although "General: A-Z" contains a mix of internal and external correspondents and looks like Grunwald's office chron files. "General: Letters" are solely external correspondents. </p>
						<p> External correspondents include former Time Inc. employees such as James Shepley and Hedley Donovan; non-Time Inc. staff members of the board (Sol M. Linowitz and Thomas J. Watson, Jr.); <title render="italic">Time</title> subscribers; freelance journalists; editors from other magazines such as Helen Gurley Brown (Cosmopolitan) and Malcom Forbes; authors; book publishers; current and former government officials such as members of Congress (Patrick Moynihan), state governors, and United States ambassadors, including former Time Inc. employee Herman Nickel, and other Department of State officials; heads of companies such as Armand Hammer (Occidental Petroleum), Katharine Graham (The Washington Post Company), Cornell Capa (International Center for Photography), and John Diebold (The Diebold Group); presidents and professors of universities; and other notable people. There is correspondence of a mixed social and official nature with notable figures who also seem to be personal friends or acquaintances such as Ben Netanyahu, Richard Nixon, Sol Linowitz, Henry Kissinger, and Ronald and Nancy Reagan. </p>
						<p> Records includes comments and complaints on articles from readers or the subjects of the articles such as the Cherokee Nation (1968), the Mayor of San Diego (1969); and Ralph Nadar (1976); internal memoranda regarding these comments or complaints; offers for and discussion of writing assignments; invitations to be a guest speaker; travel arrangements; notifications of notable visitors to Time Inc.; applications to associations such as Chaos Club and Century Club; discussion of recently attended events; and general social correspondence. </p>
						<p> Items of interest include two early letters from Grunwald to Content Peckham during his first job as a copy boy (1944-1952); a thank you letter from Judge Sirica on being named Man of the Year (1974); a very angry letter from Kurt Vonnegut regarding a <title render="italic">People</title> article (1979); a letter from Fidel Castro Ruz (1981); complaints from Accuracy in Media in its early years; slide photographs from a 1977 Irving Lazar party; years-long correspondence with Vladimir Nabokov; an invitation from Diane von Furstenburg for Gloria Steinem's 50th birthday (1984); and several letters between him and the Reagans including handwritten notes from Nancy. </p>
						<p> In 2004, shortly before Grunwald's death, his files were reviewed by a family representative and parts were removed to return to his family. In most instances, photocopies take their place. In some instances, there are notes from Time Inc. librarian C. Weil indicating what was removed. Removals include "items of personal nature, family, real estate on Vineyard."</p>

						<head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
						<p>The Departmental Files are Grunwald's office files on various projects and subjects. Records include topical files of research for articles and essays; essays for the annual reports; magazine development with some market testing and development strategy plans; submissions of essays from others on requested topics (U.S. Woman); opinion surveys (Yanklovich); nominations for and debate over Man of the Year (later Person of the Year); public and other news organization opinions on the Sharon v. Time libel case; letters of congratulations for appointments; research memos from Dorothy Ferenbaugh and others (irredentism, World Press Freedom Committee); meeting agenda and notes along with some meeting transcripts; some speech scripts and presentation print-outs for events such as Edit Staff Dinners and <title render="italic">Life</title>'s 50th Anniversary; and agenda, attendee lists, and planning materials for conferences sponsored by Time Inc. (Western Symposium and <title render="italic">Discover</title> Terrorism Conference) and other programs such as the Distinguished Speakers Program. New magazines in development include: <title render="italic">Together</title>, <title render="italic">Quality</title>, <title render="italic">Yesterday</title>, <title render="italic">Leisure</title>, <title render="italic">Home Office</title>, and <title render="italic">Woman</title>.</p>
						<p> Topics of discussion include new features (What To Do About…, Sex Section); laws affecting the publishing/journalism field (Shield Law, Stanford Supreme Court decision); ideas for articles for special issues ("The Black Issue" and "Southern Issue"), and comment notes on Time Inc.'s magazines and their competitors such as <title render="italic">Newsweek</title>. </p>
						<p> Items of interest include includes remarks from several long-time employees on the history of <title render="italic">Time</title> including Roy Larsen in the 1973 Anniversary Dinner file; letters of congratulations in 1977 include one from President Jimmy Carter; a dummy for "Tempus," the <title render="italic">Time</title> College Supplement in the 1979 Magazine Development file; letters of congratulations in 1979 were received from the Librarian of Congress, National Security Advisor, Lee Iacocca, Rupert Murdoch, George Steinbrenner and Barbara Walters; a schedule of Vice President Mondale's 1979 visit to NYC and Time Inc.; handwritten, possible photocopy, letter from artist Andrew Wyeth in 1983; and a possible Entertainment Weekly precursor proposal in the 1984 Staff Magazine Ideas files. </p>
						<p> Early Files and 1963-1973 make up two groups of files found housed together, respectively, that are not from a single year. They were kept in the found groups, but reorganized chronologically. Some of the files designated as 1973 date from 1970 to 1972. 1974 has two sets of alphabetical files; one was transferred with a form and one was not, but is similar, though not duplicates, to the transferred set of files. The Departmental Files contain some name and memo files similar to Interoffice Correspondence that are not duplicates. Since these files were transferred to the Time Inc. Archives as Departmental Files, they have not been moved to Interoffice Correspondence.</p>

						<p>Trips taken by Grunwald are a mix of professional and personal although the professional aspect is meetings and conferences along with general fact-finding about the area. The trips seem to be separate from the Newstours. Grunwald writes notes about his impressions on his trips specifically for Africa (1966), Portugal (1975), Cuba (1979), and China (1980). Cuba also includes a transcript of Grunwald's and Richard Duncan's interview with Fidel Castro. Other items of interest include personal family correspondence in Paris and Italy (1965), and a signed photo of Julius Nyerere in Africa (1966). Other records include Time Editorial query sheets, travel itineraries, meeting agenda, event ephemera, correspondence arranging travel logistics, non-trip related work correspondence, and receipts.</p>

						<p>The Departmental Files are McManus's office files on various projects and subjects. This is also where McManus collected correspondence sent out by prior editors-in-chief Hedley Donovan and Henry Grunwald. Records include invitations to serve on boards (Boy Scouts); articles on the Time Warner merger; protest letters on advertisements published in Time Inc.'s magazines (Condom Ads and Feminist Complaints); memoranda about the information reference services provided by Edit Services; memoranda and reports reviewing problems or required retooling of the magazines (<title render="italic">Fortune</title>: Bias and <title render="italic">Time</title>: Task Force); the complaint letter from the staff organization Lesbians and Gay Men at Time Warner with annotations by McManus (Gay Complaints); proposals for collaboration with television networks regarding <title render="italic">News on Demand</title>; correspondence about possible book publication (Schwarzkopf); registration materials for the staff softball team; and memoranda discussing the first issue of <title render="italic">Martha Stewart Living</title>. The term "memorabilia" in titles refers to papers, not objects. Two archives transfer forms found stapled to the front of files are at the end.</p>

					<p>Ray Cave started at <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title> as a reporter in 1959 and rose to executive editor of the magazine. After a "stint as Acting Editorial Director of all Time Inc. publications", Editor-in-Chief Hedley Donovan appointed Cave as <title render="italic">Time</title> Assistant Managing Editor in 1976. The next year, he became <title render="italic">Time</title> Managing Editor and served in this role through 1985. While the managing editor, he oversaw the Time-Life News Service and the Newstours, and participated in Newstours. Cave transferred back to the corporate editorial offices as Corporate Editor in 1986 and was promoted to Editorial Director in 1987. According to a memorandum from Cave in 1987, his duties as the corporate editor were "Whatever the Editor in Chief wants me to do" along with reading copy for <title render="italic">People</title> and <title render="italic">Money</title>, overseeing Editorial Services, top-editing the staff newsletter <title render="italic">FYI</title>, and coordinating editorial participation in lunchtime forums.

					<head>Biographical Note</head>
					<p>Richard B. Stolley was the first managing editor of <title render="italic">People</title> when it was founded in 1974. In 1981, Stolley took part in a rotating corporate editorial position while remaining his regular role as <title render="italic">People</title> Managing Editor. </p>
					<p> In 1982 Stolley became the managing editor of <title render="italic">Life</title>. By the summer of 1985, Stolley was working both as the <title render="italic">Life</title> Managing Editor and the managing editor of Magazine Development. By December 1985, he is also the managing editor of a new magazine in development called <title render="italic">Picture Week</title>. In his correspondence, Stolley describes <title render="italic">Picture Week</title> as a weekly black and white news and human interest picture magazine. Development stops by November 1986. </p>
					<p> During the fall of 1987, Stolley became the Director of Special Projects, a corporate position. In 1989, Stolley was promoted to the position of Editorial Director. While working as Editorial Director, he served on the Corporate Contributions Committee. Stolley remained the Editorial Director until his retirement in 1993 when Henry Muller moved into this role. </p>
					<p> After his retirement, Stolley took a position with Time Inc. as a senior editorial adviser and was still in this position as of 2017. Additionally, Stolley worked as an executive producer on the television program "Extra" from 1995 to 1996 and was named to the Hall of Fame of the American Society of Magazine Editors in 1996.</p>

					<head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
					<p>These are a mix of folders from various people who worked in Corporate Editorial serving as Corporate Editor or Editorial Director or both. The files mainly come from Ray Cave with others from Ralph Graves and Jason McManus. Some folders have initials on the label indicating whose files, but most folders do not. Some folders start as the files of one position-holder and transition to the next position-holder. The files from Graves span from 1976 to 1982; the files from McManus span from 1983 to 1985; and the files from Cave span from 1985 to 1988. Perhaps the files were organized or transferred to the archives while Cave was Editorial Director accounting for his files being mainly representation. Because the titles jump from H to N, it is possible some folders are missing or were included in a different set of records.</p>
					<p> Records include discussion of job descriptions; updates to or implementations of company and editorial policies; monthly estimates on income and operating costs from different departments; memoranda and reports on the mid-1980s company-wide hiring and salary freeze and restructuring; and correspondence and memoranda about books Time Inc. published or explored publishing.</p>

					<head>Biographical Note</head>
					<p>Jason McManus started at Time Inc. in 1957 as a summer trainee, and Time Inc. hired him in 1959. He held various writing and editor positions with <title render="italic">Time</title> rising to Executive Editor in 1978. Richard Stolley then McManus temporarily served on a corporate editorial assignment as rotating Assistant Corporate Editor from around June 1981 to November 1982 according to the Department Head Lists in the Time Inc. Reference Files. While serving at the corporate editorial level, McManus retained his regular title as <title render="italic">Time</title> Executive Editor. Since McManus held the temporary assignment after Stolley and also later became the permanent Corporate Editor, it appears that many files from the temporary assignment during this time span were taken over by his office. According to a transfer form, his office sent them to the Time Inc. Archives in 1987 which is when McManus was promoted from Corporate Editor to Editor-in-Chief.</p>

					<p>Gilbert "Gil" Rogin started at Time Inc. in 1955 as <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title> newsmarker at the clipping desk. He worked his way up at <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title> becoming the Managing Editor in 1982. In 1983, Rogin briefly held a corporate editorial position as a special assistant to Editor-in-Chief Henry Grunwald. This may have been part of the rotating program to give various managing editors experience in the corporate editorial office. In 1984, he became the <title render="italic">Discover</title> Managing Editor and stayed in this position until its closure. He took over as Corporate Editor in 1987, replacing Jason McManus.</p>

					<p>Gilbert "Gil" Rogin started at Time Inc. in 1955 as <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title> newsmarker at the clipping desk. He worked his way up at <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title> becoming the Managing Editor in 1982. In 1983, Rogin briefly held a corporate editorial position as a special assistant to Editor-in-Chief Henry Grunwald. This may have been part of the rotating program to give various managing editors experience in the corporate editorial office. In 1984, he became the <title render="italic">Discover</title> Managing Editor and stayed in this position until its closure. He took over as Corporate Editor in 1987, replacing Jason McManus.</p>

					<head>Biographical Note</head>
					<p>Marshall Loeb was a writer and editor at Time Inc. from 1956 to 1994. After holding positions at <title render="italic">Time</title>, Loeb became managing editor at <title render="italic">Money</title> in 1980. While holding this position, Loeb also served as an editor with the corporate Magazine Development Group. A November 5, 1985 letter from Loeb to Fred Gruin in his Miscellaneous file states Loeb is on a temporary assignment acting as assistant to Time Inc. editor-in-chief Henry Grunwald. Loeb's files show that he held these three positions simultaneously from around 1984 to 1986. The contents of the file Descripton of Duties has a list of his responsibilities as the "Third Man" in Corporate Editorial, after Grunwald and corporate editor Jason McManus. In 1986 he became the managing editor of <title render="italic">Fortune</title> where he remained until his retirement in 1994. </p>

					<head>Scope and Contents</head>
					<p>While some of Marshall Loeb's files relate to his positions as managing editor of <title render="italic">Money</title> and editor with the corporate Magazine Development Group, the majority document corporate editorial activities during his tenure as assistant to the editor-in-chief Henry Grunwald. According to the list of duties in his files, some of his reponsibilities which these files reflect were to: evaluate Edit-Publishing projects and proposals; oversee relations with Publishing of the foreign publication Asiaweek; oversee the Time Australia editorial policy agreement; oversee Time Inc. history; arrange a Time Inc. takeover conference; maintain contact with Video Group and keep Grunwald and McManus informed; work with Frank Trippet on his minority writers program; work with Don Wilson on distribution of the Time Inc. history publication by Curt Prendergast; and represent Grunwald at various corporate meetings, budget reviews, and industry conferences. Some records earlier than 1984 look like they were passed down by prior temporary corporate editorial staff.</p>
