    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Chiapas Media Project, founded in 1998 by Alexandra Halkin and Paco Vazquez, facilitated the production and distribution of media through four regional media centers built and equipped in collaboration with the Zapatista communities in Chiapas, Mexico. The Chiapas Media Project collaboratively produced 32 documentaries for international distribution, largely authored by community members themselves. The films, which focus on issues such as indigenous sovereignty, indigenous cultural practices, environmental sustainability, sustainable food practices, and autonomous education, have been screened at over 120 film festivals in 20 countries between 1998 and 2010, as well as many college and university campuses and other locations across the globe. The Chiapas Media Project is now known as Promedios de Comunicación Comunitaria, and has been a part of the Americas Media Initiative since 2010. Promedios continues to work with indigenous and non-indigenous communities in Southern Mexico providing audiovisual training and technical support.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>At the time of accessioning, audiovisual materials were separated from the archival collection for bibliographic management. The remaining collection was rehoused in archival boxes and described on the collection-level with a box-level inventory.</p><p>In July of 2022, the collection was arranged and described by an archivist. The collection was divided into Series based on record type and material was arranged intellectually within these Series. Wherever possible, record titles were taken directly from inventories or labels provided by the donor. Physically, audiovisual items are stored together with others of the same format.</p><p>One VHS tape (774_237) had a cracked cartridge, which was repaired by the Media Preservation Unit in July, 2022. </p><p>Born-digital items were identified, physically separated, and forensically imaged, analyzed, and described.
