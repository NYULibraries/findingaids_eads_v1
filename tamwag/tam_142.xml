            <p>James S. Allen (1906-1986), an organizer, Marxist scholar, writer and editor for the Communist Party, USA, was born Sol Auerbach in Philadelphia in 1906, the year his parents, Jacob and Luba, who were Russian Jewish radicals, came to the U.S. A doctoral candidate in philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, he traveled in 1927 with the first American student delegation to the Soviet Union. In 1928 he was expelled from college for his radical activities, joined the Communist Party and began writing for the 
                <title render="italic">Daily Worker</title>, and edited the 
                <title render="italic">Labor Defender</title>. In 1930, he took the pen name by which he became known and, with his wife Isabelle, founded and edited the 
                <title render="italic">Southern Worker</title>, the first Communist weekly published in the South, which was circulated on an underground basis. As a member of the Party's Southern District committee, Allen played a prominent role in all of the CPUSA's major regional activities during the early 1930s; the organizing of Alabama sharecroppers, the Harlan, Kentucky miners' strike and the Scottsboro case.</p>
            <p>Three books by Allen, 
                <title render="italic">The Negro Question in the United States</title> (1936), 
                <title render="italic">Reconstruction: The Battle for Democracy</title> (1937), and 
                <title render="italic">American Communism and Black Americans</title> (with Philip Foner, 1987), reflect his political concerns and southern experiences. By 1931, the strain of underground political work caused Allen to leave the South. In the late 1930s he was CPUSA representative in the Philippines, and a correspondent for The Nation (per a letter by editor Max Lerner), where he helped obtain the release of Communist prisoners and helped achieve the merger of the Communist and Socialist Parties. He served as foreign editor of the 
                <title render="italic">Daily Worker</title> until being drafted in 1944.</p>
            <p>During the Cold War years, he served as foreign editor of the Sunday Worker and was compelled to appear as a witness before the House Un-American Activities Committee. During the years 1958-1966, Allen was the secretary of the Party's National Program Committee, which was charged with developing a new program for the CPUSA, and he authored the initial drafts of the program, which was not published until 1970, and corresponded with prominent communists including Herbert Aptheker, William Z. Foster, John Howard Lawson, Pettis Perry and Al Richmond. From 1962 to 1972 Allen headed International Publishers, the CPUSA publishing house, having assisted his predecessor Alexander Trachtenberg, over the previous decades. He later served as U.S. editor of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels, a joint undertaking with English and Soviet publishers, corresponding with the British Marxist philosopher Maurice Cornforth. Allen also wrote several polemical books and pamphlets, including 
                <title render="italic">Atomic Energy and Society</title> (1949), which elicited a signed letter from Albert Einstein, and several unpublished manuscripts, including a memoir titled "Visions and Revisions," a portion of which was posthumously published as

            <p>The collection documents James Allen's life-long involvement in the Communist Party, particularly his leadership of the National Program Committee and his work in the Philippines, in the form of correspondence, notes, research materials, photographs, minutes, drafts, and other materials. Manuscripts and typescripts document Allen's writing career, especially in regards to his autobiography and his works on politics and race relations in the South. The collection also includes biographical information on Allen and materials related to his early and personal life. A small amount of material was created or collected by Allen's wife, Isabelle Auerbach, and reflects her involvement with the Communist Party and other political causes.</p>

                    <p>The Biographical and Correspondence series is divided into two subseries, alphabetical and chronological, and principally consists of correspondence. Notable are a file of 1938 correspondence between Allen and his wife, Isabelle Auerbach, much of it written during his trip to the Philippines; correspondence with William Z. Foster, who sought Allen's advice regarding his writings; a polemical exchange with Hyman Lumer, regarding his War Economy and Crisis (1954); correspondence with Japanese Marxist publisher Takeshi "Fred" Haga; some of Allen's student writings; and a file on his dismissal in 1928 from his position as a philosophy instructor at the University of Pennsylvania. Also included is some of Isabelle Auerbach's later correspondence, mostly pertaining to her work with International Publishers.</p>

                    <p>The Subject files contain notes, journals and other materials from Allen's trips to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (1960-61), and various documents, ephemera, research materials and notes, mostly on post-WWII economic and political topics, although there is some material from Allen's time in the South. The file on the Cuban Revolution contains a lengthy report by Allen dated November, 1957. A notable file, Agrarian Commission (CPUSA), contains letters (including several from sharecroppers), minutes (attendees included Puro, Haywood, Ware), position statements, reports, and other internal documents describing local farm organizing conditions in the South and the Midwest in the early 1930s.</p>

                        <p>Subseries D: Other Writings contains numerous brief, mostly unpublished typescripts from the late 1920s through the early 1980s. Many deal with the debates over Party policy and theory in the 1945-1960 era (critiques of Earl Browder and John Gates); others cover various topics including current events, political economy, the Soviet Union, and the developing countries, including an interview with the former leader of the Cuban Communist Party, Blas Roca (1978). There are also book contracts and reviews, memorial portraits of prominent communists, and publishing correspondence for
