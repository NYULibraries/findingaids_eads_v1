    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>In his relatively short lifetime (1871-1912), William Mailly became known as one of the leading figures in the formative period of modern American socialism. Following a common school education and a brief work experience as a coal miner, Mailly served as an editor on several labor newspapers in the South. Mailly also worked as a relentless editor and organizer for the Social Democratic Party and the Socialist Party. During the height of his involvement in various socialist activities, Mailly was the editor of the <title render="italic">Haverhill</title>(mass.) <title render="italic">Social Democrat</title>(1898), associate editor of <title render="italic">The Worker</title>in New York (1901, 1906-1907), and managing editor of the <title render="italic">New York Evening Call</title>(1908-1909). Besides his journalistic accomplishments, Mailly helped organize the Social Democratic Party in 1898, served as the National Secretary of the Socialist Party from 1903 to 1905, and was a member of the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party from 1905 to 1906.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The William Mailly Papers, 1907-1913, consist of the following 12 subject files (some containing more than one folder): articles, play reviews and theatre critiques, newspaper stories, poetry, plays, short stories, notes, miscellaneous, scrapbook, correspondence, resignation from the Ladies' Waist and Dressmakers Union, and letters of condolence to his widow, Bertha Howell Mailly. Each file has been given a microfilm frame number (i.e., XVIII:6, where the roman numeral indicates that the Mailly Papers are the 18th collection within the microfilm publication: <title render="italic">Socialist Collections in the Tamiment Library, 1872-1956</title>). The frame number and a citation for each file and its contents can be found in the complete reel list.</p><p>The items in the files pertaining to articles, play reviews and theatre critiques, poetry, plays, and short stories are arranged in alphabetical order according to the title of the item. The remaining subject files are arranged in chronological order.</p><p>Of special interest in this collection are the articles, play reviews, newspaper stories, and short stories which Mailly wrote for various socialist and non socialist publications. The articles (XVIII:l) and newspaper stories (XVIII:3) cover a wide range of subjects such as Australian elections, national defense, "slavery" in Alabama, Irish nationalism, strikes, drama, Socialist Party events, and theatre censorship. The numerous play reviews (XVIII:2) offer a unique insight into the realm of socialist theater criticism and the "new theater" movement of the early 20th century. Mailly's most creative literary works in this collection are located in the short stories file (XVIII:6). The relationship between socialist theory and complex human emotions is best revealed in "The Courtship of Hughey Carey", "The Cry of a Child", "The Home Coming of Katie Dublin", "Mary Cullen", and "The Price They Pay</p><p>Other items of note in the Mailly Papers include Mailly's resignation letters from the Ladies' Waist and Dressmakers Union and the letters of condolence sent to Mailly's wife, Bertha Howell Mailly, following his death. Among the correspondents writing to Mrs. Mailly were Eugene V. Debs, Morris Hillquit, Charles Edward Russell, James H. Maurer, and James Oneal.</p>  </scopecontent>
