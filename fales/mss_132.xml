    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Heather Lewis was born in Bedford, New York and attended Sarah Lawrence College. She is the author of three published novels. The first, <emph render="italic">House Rules</emph> (1994), details the experiences of a fifteen year old girl working as a show rider of horses-an experience the author herself had in her teenage years. Lewis's second novel, <emph render="italic">The Second Suspect</emph> (1998), follows the struggles of a female police investigator trying to prove the guilt of a powerful and influential businessman responsible for the rape and murder of several young women. The third, posthumously published novel, <emph render="italic">Notice</emph> (2004), describes the experiences of a young prostitute, Nina and her involvement with a sadist and his wife. Her works explore aspects of American culture, such as the connections between power, drugs, sex, violence, love and justice. Through these themes, Heather Lewis draws the reader into questioning the nature of love and relationships, the character of human nature or motivation and, most challengingly, the boundary between pleasure and pain. Significantly, the novels present strong, yet vulnerable female characters offering an alternative to more typical American narrative constructions driven by male protagonists within male-dominated scenes.</p><p>Heather Lewis taught at the Writer's Voice and contributed to various anthologies of literature including <emph render="italic">Best Lesbian Erotica</emph> (1996, 1997), <emph render="italic">Once Upon a Time: Erotic Fairy Tales for Women</emph> (1996), and <emph render="italic">A Woman Like That: Lesbian and Bisexual Writers Tell Their Coming Out Stories</emph> (1999). The collection also includes work by Allan Gurganus, Dale Peck, Mike Corrigan, Margaret Au, as well as shorter pieces by Sarah Schulman, Meg Daly, and others. Heather Lewis returned to New York in the fall of 2001, after a year in Arizona. She ended her life in May of 2002, in New York.</p><p> Sources:</p><p>Memorial service program: St. Mark's Church, New York, NY, June 12, 2002.</p><p>"Pain and Perfection" (Anonymous). <emph render="italic">The Advocate</emph>; Los Angeles, June 11, 2002.</p>  </bioghist>

It is important to note that this project underwent several name changes. Initially Lewis called the project "Gambler's Choice" and "60-40" before changing the novel's title to "House Rules". With this in mind, the series is divided into five subseries. Subseries A consists of "Gambler's Choice" manuscripts. Subseries B includes "Sixty-Forty" manuscripts and plot synoposis. Subseries C includes "House Rules" manuscripts, outlines and summaries. Subseries D contains publishing information such as cover art. Subseries E includes publicity materials including advertisements, interviews and book reviews. Materials are organized alphabetically in each subseries.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref131" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries A: Gambler's Choice Manuscript</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref132" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Gambler's Choice"</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_ea932ab9c9aa68384f25122ffa1d98c3" label="Mixed Materials (31142042232127)" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_ea932ab9c9aa68384f25122ffa1d98c3" type="Folder">114</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref133" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>To do list "fixing" Gambler's Choice, uses all three titles: Gambler's Choice, 60-40 and House Rules.</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_3af5cfba271b5f26d5fedb861a9c7b54" label="Mixed Materials (31142042232127)" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_3af5cfba271b5f26d5fedb861a9c7b54" type="Folder">115</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref134" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries B: "Sixty-Forty" Manuscript</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref135" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Plot synopsis "Sixty-Forty" or "House Rules"</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_61b2774cbc7cc4de2b957b873eeefe6c" label="Mixed Materials (31142042232127)" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_61b2774cbc7cc4de2b957b873eeefe6c" type="Folder">116</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref136" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Sixty-Forty Current" Draft with annotations.</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_5258b7953d88643929aa59c1b8f6b33a" label="Mixed Materials (31142042232127)" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_5258b7953d88643929aa59c1b8f6b33a" type="Folder">117</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref137" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"60-40 - Early Drafts" with annotations and drawings</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_f239c4d03c5ca2dca50e9e623094a1a3" label="Mixed Materials (31142042232127)" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_f239c4d03c5ca2dca50e9e623094a1a3" type="Folder">118</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref138" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries C: House Rules Manuscripts</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref139" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Acknowledgements</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_26c03a070b1800bd4144ba5f45bdf0ba" label="Mixed Materials (31142042232127)" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_26c03a070b1800bd4144ba5f45bdf0ba" type="Folder">119</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref140" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Allan's Comments"</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_768e1f1585ec484b136248a4e4ac2f3c" label="Mixed Materials (31142042232127)" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_768e1f1585ec484b136248a4e4ac2f3c" type="Folder">120</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref141" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Draft, Chapter 3</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_834617a35e66ee156473cf6ee200263d" label="Mixed Materials (31142042232127)" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_834617a35e66ee156473cf6ee200263d" type="Folder">121</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref142" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>House Rules Draft, chapter 5, with annotations.</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_df84d8d7b6babc06213f6fdbb19dcfb3" label="Mixed Materials (31142042232127)" type="Box">6</container><container parent="aspace_df84d8d7b6babc06213f6fdbb19dcfb3" type="Folder">122</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref143" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>House Rules Draft.
