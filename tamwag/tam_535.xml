Shaheen (1935-2017) was a professor, author, and consultant who dedicated his career to identifying and contesting stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in American media. The Jack G. Shaheen Papers date from 1943 to 2012 and document Shaheen's scholarly and popular writing and research in media analysis; his media accountability activism through the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC); and his consultation work on legal cases as well as the entertainment industry. The collection includes printed and born-digital draft and revised writings, speeches, notes, research and subject files, reports, correspondence, and sound and video recordings of Shaheen's speeches. The collection also contains material collected by Shaheen, including comic books; editorial cartoons; recordings of movies, television shows, and cartoons; magazines; posters; advertisements; toys; games; and other ephemera, which depict Arabs and Muslims in American popular culture and mass media from the late 19th to the 21st centuries.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Dr. Jack G. Shaheen (1935-2017) was a professor, author, and consultant who dedicated his career to identifying and contesting stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in American media.  His research analyzes the origins of these stereotypes, their persistence, the ways in which they affect perceptions of Arabs and Muslims in society, and presents solutions to counter them effectively.  He was a professor emeritus of Mass Communications at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, Illinois where he taught between 1969 and 1994, and was a Fulbright lecturer in Mass Communications at the American University of Beirut in 1974 and 1975 and at the University of Jordan in 1982.  </p><p>Shaheen began his research into Arab stereotypes in 1974 and collected materials which contained Arab stereotypes, both negative and positive.  He wrote books, popular and scholarly articles, and op-eds, and lectured at colleges and universities, private institutions, and at conferences and conventions.  After the events of September 11, 2011, he documented and fought stereotypes of Muslims as well.  His books include <emph render="italic">The TV Arab</emph> (1984), <emph render="italic">Guilty: Hollywood's Verdict on Arabs after 9/11</emph> (2008), and <emph render="italic">Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People</emph> (2001), which was produced as a documentary in 2006.  Shaheen worked as a consultant on legal cases and in the entertainment industry, most notably on the films <emph render="italic">Three Kings</emph> (1999) and <emph render="italic">Syriana</emph> (2005).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>Roughly 73 linear feet of video recordings (VHS cassettes and DVDs) and films were separated from the paper materials in 2011 and a video collection (VIDEOS.015) was created for these materials.  In 2015, the VHS cassettes and DVDs were deaccessioned from the collection and sent to the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and the Asian/Pacific/American Institute at NYU.  Commercially available titles were returned to the Tamiment Library and reincorporated into the collection in June 2017.   In October 2017 two boxes of material were sent to the Tamiment Library from the Asian/Pacific/American Institute containing sound recordings, commercial video recordings, and paper material.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Between 2013 and 2014, the paper portion of the collection was surveyed by a graduate student assistant who completed partial processing of the collection.  Several linear feet of materials were removed from their original order and housing.  They were arranged into series and subseries according to the current arrangement of the collection.  </p><p>In July 2015, the entire collection was surveyed by an archivist and a processing plan was created with the current arrangement scheme.  The arrangement scheme reflects what was determined to be the collection's original order from the material that had not been processed in 2013 and 2014, and the order of materials that were arranged at that time.  </p><p>In May 2017, the entire collection was resurveyed by an archivist and arranged into the current arrangement scheme.  Material previously separated from the collection was reviewed by the archivist and reincorporated intellectually and physically into the appropriate series and/or subseries.  An inventory was created for Series V and an existing inventory of Series VI was updated.</p><p>Material was rehoused in acid-free folders and boxes.  Interleaving paper was placed between newspaper clippings and other papers.  Thermal fax paper was photocopied to preserve fading information on the paper.  </p><p>Some material in Series III was determined to be protected under attorney work-product doctrine.  This was removed from the collection and returned to the donor in June 2017.</p><p>Two floppy disks were forensically imaged and the files were transferred into New York University storage.  One 8GB flash drive containing two video files was included in the collection but is damaged and inaccessible.  New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p><p>In October 2017, material was sent to the Tamiment Library from the Asian/Pacific/American Institute at NYU that was not included in the original shipment of material.  This material was integrated into the collection were appropriate.</p><p>In 2018, accretions to the collection were received. These materials were rehoused in archival boxes and folders, and described as part of Series VII. 2018 Accretions.</p>  </processinfo>

The series contains VHS cassettes, DVDs, and 16 mm film reels of movies (feature length and shorts), cartoons, music videos, television series, and a television commercial.  The titles span from <emph render="italic">She</emph> (1911) to <emph render="italic">Disney: Treasure Buddies</emph> (2012) and include American and foreign films, Disney and Warner Brothers cartoons, pro-wrestling videos, and music videos.  The feature films cover almost every genre of film, with romance, comedies, action/adventure, sci-fi, horror, and children/family being the best represented.  The most prominent stereotypes in this series are depictions of Arabs as sheikhs and terrorists, with movies featuring tales of Sinbad, Aladdin, and mummies also well represented.
