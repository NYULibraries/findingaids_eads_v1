<p>No physical re-arrangement or other processing has been done with the collection; it remains as received by two donors in the 1950s. Description of the collection in this finding aid and a catalog record, based on a skim of the content, was done in January 2022 by archivist Larry Weimer.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes matchbook covers received from two donors in the 1950s. The more extensive and well-organized of the two is the Harvey J. Hess Collection, which holds matchbook covers from hotels/motels and dining establishments from across the United States, its territories, and other locales, as well as military posts, universities, United States ships (USS), hospitals, and other institutions. The smaller H. Maxson Holloway Collection holds covers from restaurants and other dining establishments as well, but seems to be less diversified in its geographic and institutional scope.</p>  </scopecontent>

Most of these are from states of the United States, and were arranged accordingly by Hess, with some from locations outside the U.S., though closely related to the U.S., such as Alaska and Hawaii (still territories when the covers were collected), and Puerto Rico. Two albums hold covers from military ships, military posts, airfields, hospitals, college campuses, and other such institutions. </p><p>The bulk are about 1.5 inches in width.
