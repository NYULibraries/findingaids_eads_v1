    <abstract id="aspace_acd4e9e1fb5f13588d0ddf9d9376f805">A small collection of documents primarily related to the annual reunions of the Lost Battalion Survivors. The Lost Battalion refers to about 550 American soldiers who found themselves trapped behind enemy lines during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive during World War I. A member of that unit, David Tulchin, compiled this collection, which includes the original field message ordering the men to advance. Newsletters, photographs, survivor lists, clippings, and other documents are also in the collection.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>On October 2, 1918, during the Allied Forces' Meuse-Argonne Offensive in France during World War I, various companies from four battalions of the 77th Division were ordered to advance against German lines as part of a larger movement. In total these companies added up to about 550 men, which was battalion strength. Under the command of Major Charles W. Whittlesey, the battalion successfully advanced, but other elements of the attack stalled or retreated. Consequently, as the Germans regrouped from the attacks, by the next day, October 3, Whittlesey and his men were surrounded and cut-off from escape. Over the next several days, the Germans laid siege to the battalion, which refused to surrender.  American forces attempted to break through to rescue the "lost battalion" but were unable to do so. Eventually, one of the battalion's men was able to slip through the German lines and establish contact with the Allied forces, which enabled the creation of an escape route for the trapped men by October 8. Of the 545 or so men that started the advance, only 194 walked out without casualty; 107 men had been killed.  </p><p>Among the companies in the Lost Battalion was Company C of the 77th Division, 154th Infantry Brigade, 1st Battalion, 308th Infantry Regiment. That company included Russian immigrant David Tulchin (born approximately 1895), who survived the event and accumulated the documents in this collection. Tulchin would, in later years, be active in the organization and annual reunions of the Lost Battalion Survivors. The first reunion of the survivors was held in 1938 and continued into at least the early 1970s. Tulchin was elected as Secretary of the group in 1965. Tulchin died in 1972.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes documents concerning the "Lost Battalion" and the Lost Battalion Survivors compiled by David Tulchin, particularly in his capacity as Secretary for the group in the late 1960s-early 1970s. An especially significant document inof the collection is the original message of October 2, 1918, ordering Company C's advance. There are several newsletters from the 1960s-1970s, a program from 1949 listing the Lost Battalion survivors as of that year, various other lists of survivors, clippings, three photographs, and other documents. Documents specific to David Tulchin in the collection include his military record, American Legion membership cards, ribbon from the 1968 reunion, and Lost Battalion survivor identification cards.</p>  </scopecontent>
