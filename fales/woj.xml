    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>David Michael Wojnarowicz was an openly gay artist, writer, and activist who chronicled a late-twentieth century New York ravaged by AIDS. His multi-media work is notable for combining elements of personal narrative with erotic, often confrontational imagery.</p><p>Wojnarowicz was born on September 14, 1954 in Red Bank, New Jersey. Following his parents' divorce, Wojnarowicz moved with his mother to New York City, where he claims he began hustling at age eleven. He attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan for a time, although he never graduated. Wojnarowicz left his mother's apartment at age sixteen to live on the streets, where for two years he was a victim of numerous assaults, before seeking shelter at a halfway house.</p><p>In the ensuing years, Wojnarowicz traveled, often by hopping trains and hitchhiking. He lived in San Francisco, as well as in France with his sister, before eventually returning to New York, where he worked as a busboy or janitor to support himself and his art. His activities at this time included performing in a band (Three Teens Kill 4 - No Motive) featuring children's instruments and tape recordings of found sounds, and documenting the Lower West Side's marginal characters through his film, writing and photography. His well-known series Arthur Rimbaud in New York, featuring images of the artist wearing a photographic mask of the symbolist poet, was created in 1978-79.</p><p>In the early 80s Wojnarowicz became known in the East Village art scene for making use of re-contextualized stencils, found maps, and grocery-store price signs to produce stark tableaux. By the mid-80s, after the death of his lover, the photographer Peter Hujar, and his own diagnosis with the disease, AIDS became a constant undercurrent in his work. The artist continued to work with images of decay, disaster and sexuality, adopting a militant stance against what he perceived as the complacency and ignorance surrounding the disease. An iconic image of the Wojnarowicz from this time appears in the film Silence = Death, where he appears with his mouth sewn shut in a reference to ACT-UP slogan.</p><p>At this controversial point in his career he was drafted in the "culture wars": the NEA rescinded and finally restored funding for an exhibition catalog in which he attacked various public figures, and he was criticized by both a member of Congress and the American Family Association. His book Close to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration was published in 1991. He continued to produce work until his death in 1992 at age 37.</p><p><emph render="bold">SOURCES:</emph></p><p>"David Michael Wojnarowicz."The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, Volume 3: 1991-1993.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The David Wojnarowicz Papers are a part of the Downtown Collection at the Fales Library, New York University. The Fales Library is the primary special collections division of the NYU libraries, housing nearly 200,000 volumes of English and American literature from 1700 to the present. Strengths of the collection include the development of the English and American novel, with an emphasis on the Gothic and the Victorian novel. The Downtown Collection, of which the Wojnarowicz Papers are a part, is a comprehensive collection of printed materials, archives, and other materials related to the Downtown New York scene from ca. 1975 to the present. 

The David Wojnarowicz Papers are comprised of journals, correspondence, manuscripts, ephemera, photography, artwork, film, video and audio works. 

The film, video and audio series (Series VIII, IX and X) of the David Wojnarowicz Papers contain audio, film and video works by David Wojnarowicz, as well as an extensive collection of film, video and audio source materials produced by Wojnarowicz. The collection of source and production materials reflects his interest in documenting environments through visual and audio recording media, as well as his tendency to reuse imagery from various media. The source materials include recorded journal entries, ambient recordings and interviews with friends and colleagues. Works by other downtown NYC artists and collaborators, such as Ben Neill, Richard Kern, Charles Atlas, Phil Zwickler, and Rosa von Praunheim are included in the collection as well as commercial works representing David Wojnarowicz's personal videotape library. Also included in the collection are taped radio interviews which document the NEA and Donald Wildmon/ American Family Association controversies. The collection also includes phone message tapes from David Wojnarowicz's personal answering machine. These tapes document significant events in his life such as the death of Peter Hujar. Descriptive information for items in these series is taken from any descriptive information provided by the artist on the object or its packaging. 

The photography series (Series IX) contains multiple formats of photographs taken by David Wojnarowicz, mainly during the 1980s and early 1990s. Negatives, contact sheets, prints, and slides offer different media in which to examine Wojnarowicz's camera style, subject matter, and photographic collages. Contact sheets often have Wojnarowicz's notation on them as to which frames to reprint or enlarge, allowing a glimpse into his artistic choices. In addition, the envelopes which originally housed the contact sheets and negatives are full of Wojnarowicz's descriptions of the images inside, and sometimes his thoughts about their artistic merit. Negatives of important Wojnarowicz photographic work, such as the Rimbaud series, diorama shots, and photographs of Peter Hujar's death, are included. These negatives are not open to researchers. Wojnarowicz's many trips to Paris, Berlin and Mexico are well documented; inspirations gained on these trips can be traced throughout Wojnarowicz's work. The prints, which range in size from 3 x 5 in. to 16 x 20 in., often show a variety of exposures and darkroom techniques on the same image, detailing the options from which the final choice was made. Wojnarowicz's collection of commercial pornographic images is included here, and contains images which were later incorporated into several of the Sex series works. Many prints of the Rimbaud series, as well as many copies of a source photograph of a meteor crater, are contained in this series. A numbered run of slides contains most of Wojnarowicz's completed art works and documents, along with the prints and contact sheets, of many of his installation pieces.</p>

<emph render="bold">SERIES IX: PHOTOGRAPHY </emph>

<list><item>This series includes photographs taken by David Wojnarowicz, photographs taken by other artists, photographs of Wojnarowicz' artwork, and source photographs Wojnarowicz was inspired by or incorporated into larger works. The majority of the contact sheets and negatives correspond to each other, and comprehensive indexing exists between the two subseries. Negatives can be found for most of the Wojnarowicz prints in this series, but have not been indexed in this way. A large numbered run of slides of completed artwork is accompanied by a list of each artwork's date and media; these seem to be pieces represented by Gracie Mansion Gallery.</item><item>Subseries A: Contact Sheets </item><item>Subseries B: Negatives </item><item>The provenance of subseries A and B is complex, and needs to be understood in order to understand the two subseries. In 1994, Aperture acquired many negatives and contact sheets from Wojnarowicz in order to use some of them in the production of the book David Wojnarowicz: Brush Fires in the Social Landscape. Aperture received 58 manila envelopes containing negatives and contact sheets, which they numbered. Other contact sheets or negatives arrived in "box 108," "box 109," "paper bag 111" etc. This original housing forms the basis for Aperture's system of organization. They organized and rehoused all the negatives, leaving contact sheets in the original envelope or box housing. Aperture also created a list of what they received, transcribing Wojnarowicz' notes, and listing the numbers of contact sheets and negatives in each folder. An abridged version of this list appears in the Container listing, and the original is attached to the finding aid as <extref href="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales/appendixa_aperturecontactsheets.pdf">Appendix A</extref>. All other contact sheets and negatives arrived at Fales Library also in manila envelopes. About half of these were numbered in red pen with numbers ranging from 2 - 41. The remaining envelopes were not numbered, but, as do all the envelopes, contain Wojnarowicz's notes about the negatives inside. A list similar to that created by Aperture was generated for these envelopes, and while much of it also appears in the Container listing below, it also is attached as <extref href="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales/appendixb_contactsheets.pdf">Appendix B</extref>. </item><item>All contact sheets are currently housed in Boxes 30 - 44, in numerical order following photocopies of any notes on the original housing. Negatives are housed correspondingly in Boxes 45 - 55, and are labeled with the number or title of the envelope in which they originated. In this way, negatives can be found based on the number of the envelope in front of the contact sheet. There are some gaps in the contact sheet-negative match. For example, Aperture's "Box 108" has no batch of corresponding negatives; negatives to these contact sheets mainly occur in the "unnumbered envelopes." In order to make these discrepancies less complex, each contact sheet is marked with the Box number in which the corresponding negative appears. Aperture-numbered envelopes are marked as such. The non-numbered envelopes are titled based on Wojnarowicz' notes and ordered as they were originally in the box in which they arrived at Fales. "Order" of these photographs, however, matters little, as Wojnarowicz himself did not order or number any of the envelopes. Original housings or notations are housed at the end of the series. </item><item>Rimbaud series. Box 44 contains an almost complete set of what appear to be original Rimbaud series contact sheets. However, the negatives for these photos were in disarray when Aperture acquired them, and new contact sheets were created. These appear in Box 37. They contain strips of negatives from different rolls of film printed onto the same contact sheet. The majority of the Rimbaud negatives appear in Box 49, with others scattered throughout the collection. A list of where the Rimbaud negatives can be found, based on the original contact sheets in Box 44, follows as <extref href="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales/appendixc_rimbaud.pdf">Appendix C</extref>. </item><item>Subseries C: Prints of Wojnarowicz Art Photographs </item><item>These prints are organized into known photographic series (such as Arthur Rimbaud in New York and the Sex Series) and then loosely by the subjects "Animals and Insects," "People," and "Things." The oversize prints are grouped together by series when known, or by photograph (including multiples from the same negative), and are described at the item level. The multiple versions reflect different contrast and exposure choices made while printing, and some of the photographs have been printed with alternative processes such as solarization or by painting directly on the print surface with chemistry. The oversize prints include the photographic series of Peter Hujar on his deathbed. </item><item>Subseries D: Prints of Source Photographs </item><item>Contains Wojnarowicz' collection of mid-20th century pornographic cards. Also included are Wojnarowicz photographs which were later used in larger collages, or were not used as part of any artwork. These are organized loosely by subjects as in Subseries C: "Animals and Insects," "People," and "Things," as well as by more specific subjects, such as "Statues," "Sex Pics," and "Paris." </item><item>Subseries E: Other People's Photographs. Composed of a 16 x 20 in. Nan Goldin photographic print (of Nan Goldin). </item><item>Subseries F: Slides. As with the contact sheets and negatives, many of these slides were acquired by Aperture in 1994 and organized and described based on letters or numbers given to the original boxes. Many of these works are reprints of photographs, some are entire rolls of color film (many of Mexico) which do not exist in print form in this collection. The majority of the slides have been housed according to this lettering and numbering system given by Aperture (A-Z, AA-ZZ, 1 - 106). An index to the topics covered in each box/sheet follows as <extref href="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales/appendixd_slides.pdf">Appendix D</extref>. These groups of slides are housed following photocopies of the notation on their original boxes, much as the contact sheets above. </item><item>A numbered list of over 300 completed artworks accompanied the slides; many of the corresponding numbered slides are scattered throughout the groupings by original slide boxes. An index to the location of these slides follows as <extref href="http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales/appendixe_numberedslides.pdf">Appendix E</extref>. In general, however, slides of completed Wojnarowicz artwork can be found in Boxes 80 - 86. </item><item>Slides not grouped or numbered in this way include documentation of Wojnarowicz installation pieces, photographs of Mexican mummies, additional numbered slides of Wojnarowicz artwork, as well as loose slides found throughout the collection. These are housed following any information which was attached to them, such as their original location or dates taken. Original housings or notations are housed at the end of the series.</item></list>

<emph render="bold">SERIES XIII: OBJECTS AND ARTIFACTS</emph>

<list><item>Subseries A: General Objects and Artifacts. The objects in this series include religious objects, figurines, jewelry, toys, textiles, and artworks. While some of the objects are artworks made by Wojnarowicz, they also include artworks made by others, ritual objects, natural artifacts and commercial objects that he collected. Some of the objects figured as props in Wojnarowicz's photography and film works. </item><item>Subseries B: The Magic Box. The Magic Box is a group of fifty-nine small objects collected by Wojnarowicz and stored by him in a pine fruit box labeled "Magic Box." According to Tom Rauffenbart, Wojnarowicz kept the box under his bed and never discussed its function or significance. The objects range from organic materials such as stones and dried flowers, to commercial products like jewelry and plastic toys. To preserve the contextual and artifactual integrity of the box as a work, Fales has kept it in the same general arrangement it was in when it came to the Fales Library in 1997. This means the objects have not been physically separated from each other, but remain piled loosely in the box, and no steps have been taken to preserve their physical condition. However, scholar Mysoon Rizk cataloged the objects before they came to Fales, and some of them remain grouped in the plastic or tissue housings she used to organize and protect them. These items are generally wrapped in tape that has been marked with her initials. </item><item>Subseries C: Personal Items. These personal effects were part of a 2001 accretion of materials from Tom Rauffenbart. The inlcude Wojnarowicz's wallet, eyeglasses, and identification cards. </item></list>

While some of the objects are artworks made by Wojnarowicz, they also include artworks made by others, ritual objects, natural artifacts and commercial objects that he collected. Some of the objects figured as props in Wojnarowicz's photography and film works. </p><p><emph render="bold">Subseries B: The Magic Box</emph>. The Magic Box is a group of fifty-nine small objects collected by Wojnarowicz and stored by him in a pine fruit box labeled "Magic Box." According to Tom Rauffenbart, Wojnarowicz kept the box under his bed and never discussed its function or significance. The objects range from organic materials such as stones and dried flowers, to commercial products like jewelry and plastic toys. To preserve the contextual and artifactual integrity of the box as a work, Fales has kept it in the same general arrangement it was in when it came to the Fales Library in 1997. This means the objects have not been physically separated from each other, but remain piled loosely in the box, and no steps have been taken to preserve their physical condition. However, scholar Mysoon Rizk cataloged the objects before they came to Fales, and some of them remain grouped in the plastic or tissue housings she used to organize and protect them. These items are generally wrapped in tape that has been marked with her initials. </p><p><emph render="bold">Subseries C: Personal Items</emph>. These personal effects were part of a 2001 accretion of materials from Tom Rauffenbart. The items include Wojnarowicz's wallet, eyeglasses, and identification cards. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref3092" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries A: General Objects and
