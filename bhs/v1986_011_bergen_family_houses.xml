    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>The Bergen family that settled and proliferated throughout New York and New Jersey beginning in the 17th century is descended from the common ancestor, Hans Hansen Bergen, a native of Bergen, Norway.  A ship's carpenter by trade, Bergen moved to Holland as a young man, and subsequently immigrated to the colony of New Amsterdam (now New York City) in 1633. His name appeared in land and church records in different forms, including Hans de Boer, Hans Noorman, Hans Hanszen Van Bergen, Hans Hansen, and Hans Hansen Bergen. It was not until the late 17th or early 18th century that his descendants formally adopted the surname, Bergen.  </p><p>In 1639, Hans Hansen Bergen married Sara Rapalje and they had eight children. Among them was Michael Hansen Bergen (baptized November 4, 1646), who held civil office for several years and was one of the patentees named in Governor Thomas Dongan's patent of May 13, 1686, which provided the land grant that established the village of Breuklen in the colony of New York. He and his wife, Femmetje Bergen (nee Theunis) had five children.  </p><p>Michael Hansen Bergen's son, Hans Michielzse Bergen (baptized March 11, 1689) was a baker who resided near Brooklyn Ferry with his wife, Rachel (nee Bensing or Benson). They had seven children, among them Tunis Bergen (baptized October 15, 1730), who held civil and military office in Brooklyn. Tunis and his wife, Johanna (nee Stoothoff) had nine children, including their son, Garret Bergen.</p><p>Garret Bergen (born January 11, 1772) held civil and church office in Brooklyn, and was married to Jane Wyckoff on January 6, 1806. Together they had 11 children, including their first born, Teunis G. Bergen, who was born on October 6, 1806 in the town of New Utrecht (later annexed to the City of Brooklyn in 1894, several years before Brooklyn's consolidation into the City of New York in 1898). </p><p>Teunis G. Bergen was a surveyor, farmer, civic leader, member of the 241st regiment of the New York State Militia, as well as an avid historical researcher, genealogist, and published author. His published works include <emph render="italic">The Register of the Early Settlers and Freeholders of Kings County, NY, from its First Settlement by Europeans, to 1700, with Biographical Notices and Family Genealogies</emph>; <emph render="italic">Genealogy of the Van Brunt Family, 1653-1867</emph>; <emph render="italic">The Bergen Family; or, the descendants of Hans Hansen Bergen, One of the Early Settlers of New York and Brooklyn, L.I., with Notes on the Genealogy of Some of the Branches of the Cowenhoven, Voorhees, Eldert, Stoothoof, Cortelyou, Stryker, Suydam, Lott, Wyckoff, Barkeloo, Lefferts, Martense, Hubbard, Van Brunt, Vanderbilt, Vanderveer, Van Nuyse, and Other Long Island Families</emph>; <emph render="italic">Genealogy of the Lefferts Family, 1650-1878</emph>; and his seven volume <emph render="italic">A History of New Utrecht, Long Island</emph>.  Additionally, he contributed frequently to the <emph render="italic">New York Genealogical and Biographical Record</emph>. Teunis G. Bergen died of pneumonia at his residence in New Utrecht at the age of 74, and was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.</p>  </bioghist>
