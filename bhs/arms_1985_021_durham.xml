He attended Adelphi Academy in Brooklyn, graduating in 1897, and then Columbia University, graduating in 1901. He was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He completed law school, also at Columbia, in 1905. He enlisted in the army in 1912 and served in the first World War. In 1925, he married Pauline Crook Peck. Her son, Robert, became his stepson, but the couple never had children of their own.</p><p>Knowlton's father Caleb Durham was born to Alpha Durham (1805-1851) and Elizabeth Riggs.

<p>Accession 1985.021 was originally minimally processed to the collection level. In May 2023, Dee Bowers added accession 2015.037 and reprocessed the collection, including photocopying newsclippings and discarding the originals.</p>  </processinfo>
  <scopecontent id="aspace_99ed660f8a8b000012b52ea5b586e034">
    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Papers mainly relate to the Durham family's ancestry and genealogical record and contain information stretching back to at least 1273, though the majority of the genealogy materials concern individuals living in the 18th through 20th centuries. Other items relate to the professional accomplishments and personal lives of certain Durham family members living in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These latter papers place particular emphasis on Knowlton Durham (b. 1880), a New York City lawyer. Materials in the collection include genealogical research notes and lists, correspondence among members of the Durham family, press releases, obituaries and marriage announcements, newspaper and magazine clippings, and other ephemera. Also included are Knowlton Durham's application to the Sons of the Revolution, including extensive details on his personal ancestry and its connection to the Revolutionary War; the Durham family's coat of arms; and one oversize volume containing records of Fire Prevention at Hook and Ladder Company No. 118 for the period 1938 to 1950, including records of incoming and outgoing documents and daily statistical and inspection records relating to fire prevention in Brooklyn. It is unknown whether the materials in this collection were compiled by a single researcher or multiple individuals, but it is presumed that the compiler(s) were related to the Durham family.</p>  </scopecontent>
