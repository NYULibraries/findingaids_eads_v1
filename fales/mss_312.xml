    <abstract id="aspace_ef016fd7c28887fef139babaa7a67900">Launched in 1986 by Paper Tiger Television, Deep Dish Television was a distribution network committed to exploring new and democratic ways of promoting video artwork and reporting.

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Launched in 1986 by Paper Tiger Television, Deep Dish Television was a distribution network committed to exploring new and democratic ways of promoting video artwork and reporting. As the first grassroots satellite network in the United States, Deep Dish produced and distributed television series on a variety of personal and political topics. Their programs linked the work of artists, independent videomakers, programmers and social activists and reached millions of people through public access channels.</p><p>Starting with their <emph render="italic">Opening Series</emph> in 1986 and increasing in momentum throughout the 1990s, Deep Dish TV produced and distributed programs on a wide variety of issues. Their programs investigated labor and immigration (<emph render="italic">Beyond the Browning of America</emph>, <emph render="italic">Siempre Trabajando: Latinos and Labor</emph>), environmental justice (<emph render="italic">Green Screen: Grassroots Views of the Environmental Crisis</emph>), censorship (<emph render="italic">Writers Uncensored</emph> and <emph render="italic">Behind Censorship: The Assault on Civil Liberties</emph>), the prison industrial complex (<emph render="italic">Emergency Programming: Mumia Abu-Jamal</emph>, <emph render="italic">America Behind Bars</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Lock Down USA</emph>), the U.S. healthcare system (<emph render="italic">Sick and Tired of Being Sick and Tired</emph>) and the Gulf War (<emph render="italic">The Gulf Crisis TV Project</emph>). They also explored international video activism with the programs <emph render="italic">…Will Be Televised: Video Documents from Asia</emph>, "Caribbean Voices," and "Hands Off Cuba!" among others.</p><p>From 2003-2005, Deep Dish TV broadcasted the series <emph render="italic">Shocking and Awful: A Grassroots Response to War and Occupation</emph> investigating the impact of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The series was later featured at the Whitney Museum of American Art's 2006 Biennial Exhibition and the Museum of Modern Art's "Theater of Operations: Gulf Wars 1991-2011" exhibition from 2019-2020. Deep Dish TV became known for their criticism of the Iraq War, and later produced extensive coverage of the World Tribunal on Iraq (Istanbul, 2005), the International Commission of Inquiry on Crimes Against Humanity of the Bush Administration (New York City, 2005-2006), and the Winter Soldier Eyewitness Accounts of the Iraq and Afghanistan Occupations (organized by the Iraq Veterans Against the War, 2008). They also criticized the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina and highlighted resistance in New Orleans with the series <emph render="italic">Trouble the Water</emph> (2006). </p><p>Throughout the 2000s, Deep Dish TV covered the Israeli occupations of Palestine ("Imperial Geography," c. 2005) and Lebanon (<emph render="italic">Nothing is Safe,</emph> 2007). In the 2010s, they focused on social movements in the United States with <emph render="italic">DIY Media: Movement Perspectives on Critical Moments</emph> (2011), <emph render="italic">Uprooted: A Grassroots Examination of the Politics of Migration</emph> (2011), <emph render="italic">An American Nightmare: Black Labor and Liberation</emph> (2015), and <emph render="italic">We Interrupt This Program</emph> (2018). They also highlighted community media around the world in the interactive series <emph render="italic">Waves of Change: The Many Voices of a Global Village (2011)</emph>.</p><p>In addition to their television programming, Deep Dish TV frequently organized and participated in film festivals, conferences, screenings, panel discussions, and exhibitions. They organized speaking tours across the United States to promote <emph render="italic">Not Channel Zero</emph> (1993-1995), "Iraqi Women Speak Out" (2006), and "Environmental Justice for All" (2006). They also organized a conference in 2010 titled "Re-Igniting the Network: Video and New Technology in the Service of Social Movements."</p><p>Deep Dish TV had a history of collaboration with other independent media organizations and advocacy for public access media. Deep Dish TV produced the first year of the television version of <emph render="italic">Democracy Now!</emph> with Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez; they played a large role in founding the Indymedia Center in Seattle, and have worked to expand that network in Africa, Asia, and Latin America; they had a close working relationship with Free Speech TV and LinkTV; and they collaborated with numerous independent media organizations within their television programming, including the series <emph render="italic">DIVA TV: Collections from this Activist Collective</emph> (broadcasted in the Spring of 1990), Black Planet Productions' <emph render="italic">Not Channel Zero</emph> (broadcasted in 1992), Seattle Independent Media Center's <emph render="italic">Showdown in Seattle</emph> (broadcasted in 1999), and Washington DC's Independent Media Center's <emph render="italic">Breaking the Bank</emph> (broadcasted in 1999). Deep Dish TV was also active in the Access for All coalition in the mid 1990s, composed of individuals and organizations working to educate and organize New Yorkers on the topic of universal, equitable, and affordable telecommunications systems. Fiscally sponsored by Media Network, the coalition conducted media literacy workshops throughout New York City.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>This collection was donated to Fales by Deep Dish TV in 2011, 2016, and 2018. Upon reception of donations in 2016 and 2018, materials were rehoused in order to adhere to preservation standards. Boxes were consolidated as possible, however original order was maintained. During offsite prep by Winthrop Group in May 2022, audiovisual items were moved between boxes for stabilization.</p><p>In 2019, the archived websites were added to the finding aid. Additional websites were added in 2021.</p><p>In 2023, this collection was processed by an archivist. The collection was divided into series based on the records' contents and arranged intellectually within these series. Audiovisual and digital items were physically arranged by format and lightly cleaned. Log sheets and notes stored within video cases were removed and stored with other paper materials.</p><p>In the Spring of 2023, 7 U-matic tapes were identified as moldy by the Media Preservation Unit. These items are currently isolated from other items by housing them in polyethylene bags with desiccated boards and RH monitor strips. If this strip indicates an RH greater than 50%, the Preservation department should be contacted ASAP. Do not open this packaging without contacting the Preservation Department. 9 MiniDV tapes were cleaned by Preservation due to pest damage. 18 1" open reels were inspected and cleaned due to their dirty condition.</p><p>In the Summer of 2023, paper materials in two boxes were treated by Preservation for rodent damage.</p><p>23 hard drives, 12 floppy disks, and 180 optical discs were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged. New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p>  </processinfo>
