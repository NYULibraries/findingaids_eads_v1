    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The School of Global Public Health grew out of a Master of Public Health program at School of Education, Health, Nursing and Arts Professions (SEHNAP) starting in 1987. In 2006, a University-wide master of public health (MPH) degree program was founded. In 2008, the Steinhardt School established a Bachelor of Science in Public Health. In 2011, the University-wide MPH and Steinhardt's MPH consolidated into the Global Institute of Public Health (GIPH) and established the Epidemiology; Biostatistics; Environmental Public Health Sciences; Public Health Policy &amp; Management; and Social and Behavioral Sciences departments and Center for Bioethics transferred from Arts and Sciences from 2013-2016. By 2015, the College of Global Public Health was formally established. In late 2019, it changed its name to the School of Global Public Health. In 2017, they started a podcast entitled I AM GPH.</p>  </bioghist>
