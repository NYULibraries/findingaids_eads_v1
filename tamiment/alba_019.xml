            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">The organization Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) was founded in 1939 to provide aid and support for American veterans and Spanish refugees of the Spanish Civil War, and to advocate for democracy in Spain. Over the years, VALB provided a mechanism for veterans and their families and friends to maintain contact with each other, and also provided a public voice for the veterans and a focal point for political action. Eventually VALB devoted itself more and more to the preservation and dissemination of the veterans' history; the group sponsored publications and public events, cooperated in oral history projects and documentary films, and gathered the letters, photographs, memorabilia and other historical records that became the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archive. These records document the lives of individual veterans and the administrative and public activity of VALB from the organization's inception to the beginning of the twenty-first century.</abstract>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The origins of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) can be traced to a meeting that Steve Nelson, David McKelvy White and William Lawrence organized for veterans of the Spanish Civil War in New York City in December 1937. The Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade was officially formed two years later in December of 1939 when a constitution for VALB was adopted at the third National Convention of veterans. The Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (FALB), which had been the principal U.S. advocate for the American volunteers and Spanish Republicans during the Spanish Civil War, was disbanded at this time.</p>
            <p>The "objects" of the organization, as stated in VALB's 1939 constitution, were to "keep alive the principles for which the Lincoln Brigade fought in Spain"; to assist in the medical and occupational rehabilitation of its members; to aid and advocate for all International Brigade prisoners still in Spain; to advocate for amnesty for "Republicans in Spain" and aid refugees of the Spanish Civil War; "to cooperate with all organizations and groups interested in promoting peace, democracy and civil liberties"; and finally "to maintain fraternal relations with organizations of veterans of the Spanish Republican Army in other countries."</p>
            <p>From the end of World War II through the early 1960s, the leadership of VALB was often prevented from focusing solely on the organization's stated goals by the need to defend the organization from government charges of subversion. Dr. Edward Barsky, leader of the American medical volunteers in Spain during the Civil War and national chairman of the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, was subpoenaed in 1946 to appear before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). When he and his board refused to surrender financial records or to turn over the names of contributors and recipients of aid, Barsky was charged with contempt of Congress, convicted, and imprisoned. Veteran Steve Nelson was arrested in 1950 and put on trial for sedition. It would be six years before Nelson's legal woes ended. In the meantime, both Nelson and Irving Weissman were arrested under the anti-Communist Smith Act and charged with subversion. Several veterans arrested under the Smith-McCarran Immigration Act in the 1950s faced deportation. A number of veterans were subpoenaed by HUAC, and ordered to testify as to whether or not they were or had been Communists. In 1953 VALB came under the scrutiny of the Subversive Activities Control Board (SACB), and two years later it was ordered to register with the United States Justice Department as a Communist-front organization. VALB refused and took the case all the way to the Supreme Court. Although the Court decided in VALB's favor in 1968, it was not until 1971 that VALB was removed from the Attorney General's list of subversive organizations.</p>
            <p>Threats from the Subversive Activities Control Board waned considerably by the mid-sixties and thus freed from the costs, in time and money, spent on hearings and trials VALB expanded its reach. Although advocacy for Spanish refugees and political prisoners, and support for democratic reforms in Spain continued to be a primary interest, members of VALB pushed the organization to face other issues as well. The Civil Rights movement, Vietnam War protests, opposition to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and support for the Sandinista rebels of Nicaragua were among the many issues and causes which VALB embraced.</p>
            <p>From the 1960s and onward, the preservation and commemoration of the history of the Spanish Civil War also became increasingly important to VALB. Members of VALB took part in reunions of the International Brigades in the German Democratic Republic, in Italy, and finally, after the death of Francisco Franco in 1975, in Spain. Members of VALB wrote memoirs and histories, gave interviews and recorded their reminiscences, lectured, took part in college symposiums, supported exhibits, and participated in film and television documentaries. The organization kept in touch with its multi-generational constituency through frequent mailings and through its newsletter, published in the early years under the title, 
                <emph render="italic">The Volunteer for Liberty</emph>, and from 1957 as 
                <emph render="italic">The Volunteer</emph>. In 1979 two archives for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade were established, a major one held at Brandeis University and administered by a knowledgeable and dedicated archivist, Victor Berch, and a smaller one at the University of California at Berkeley. The Brandeis collections were transferred to the Tamiment Library at New York University in 2001 and have since grown substantially through new donations. For many years VALB maintained an office at 799 Broadway in New York City; its last Secretary was Lincoln Brigade veteran Moe Fishman.</p>

                <emph render="bold">Series I: Spanish Civil War Era Materials, 1933-1940.</emph></p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Sub-series A: Volunteers and Participants</emph>. Correspondence, writings and ephemera of nearly eighty volunteers and participants in the Spanish Civil War comprise this sub-series. Of special note is a typescript of Eslanda Robeson's diary. Robeson kept this diary from January to February of 1938 when she accompanied her husband, Paul Robeson, on his tour to entertain the troops in Spain.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Sub-series B. General Files</emph>. This sub-series includes articles, drafts and translations of articles, and news bulletins that were used to publicize the plight of the Spanish people and build support for the Republican cause; appeals and bulletins of several organizations that provided aid for the Spanish people and awareness of the Republican cause in Spain including the Medical Bureau and North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy and the Spanish Refugee Relief Campaign; and extensive files of the Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (FALB) that contain correspondence, minutes and information regarding FALB's efforts to support the American volunteers, veterans and the Spanish people. Letters to and from Eleanor Roosevelt are included in the FALB files; documents regarding the efforts of Gypsy Rose Lee and Helen Hayes to aid the Spanish Refugees are also in this sub-series. Also of note are correspondence and reports regarding soldiers in the field and prisoners. Reports from the field include summaries of meetings, write-ups of individual soldiers, and notes regarding supplies, hospital conditions and transportation networks.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series II: General Files, 1940-2006; undated</emph>. This series contains correspondence, subject files, writings, office files, clippings and ephemera that document the lives of individual veterans, the activities of VALB Posts, and the myriad causes and concerns of VALB membership over the years. The correspondence files, which include official VALB correspondence as well as announcements and appeals, and the office files provide an overview of the activities and concerns of the veterans from 1950-2000. Subjects with especially rich documentation include anniversary celebrations, commemorations and reunions; anti-Franco protests; political movements and political prisoners in Spain; and VALB's struggles with the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC).</p>
            <p>Of special note are the Alvah Bessie, Heart of Spain correspondence files (1949-1953). Although ostensibly this correspondence is about the preparation and publication of a VALB anthology, Bessie's letters, especially those to and from Moe Fishman, are a rich source, full of news and commentary on politics and on the trials and tribulations of various veterans.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series III: Scrapbooks, 1939-1953; undated</emph>. This series consists of two scrapbooks. One scrapbook contains official correspondence dating from 1939 to 1953. Included are fundraising letters signed by Lillian Hellman, Paul Robeson, Vincent Sheean, and David McKelvy White, among others. The second scrapbook contains broadsides, invitations, tickets, stamps, and brochures for dances, rallies, fundraisers and other VALB events. These scrapbooks provide an overview of VALB’s early years.</p>
