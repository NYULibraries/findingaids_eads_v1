            <p>The New-York Historical Society Pictorial Archive (NYHS-RG 5) primarily includes images of N-YHS’s buildings, galleries and other interior spaces, exhibitions, collection objects, programs, and people, such as trustees, officers, and staff. The bulk of the images date roughly from the early 1900s into the 1970s, though there are images from earlier and later periods. Most of the record group includes black and white photographic prints, but there are also negatives, color slides, and some color prints. There are also a relatively small number of non-photographic formats, including drawings, posters, and architectural plans for building renovations after 1965.</p>
            <p>Many of the photographic prints found in the record group have a control number noted on the back; this number corresponds to negatives, many of which are still extant and found in Series XI. The envelopes holding the negatives often include descriptive information that goes beyond that found with the print.</p>
            <p>There are many highlights in the record group. The Buildings series includes rich sets of photographs documenting the construction of the Central Park West building in the early 1900s and the major expansion of 1937-1938. There are many photographs of galleries, the library, and other spaces in both the Central Park West building and N-YHS’s earlier home on 2nd Avenue and 11th Street. The Exhibitions series includes installation and related object and publicity photographs. Photographs for exhibitions and programs also include the opening receptions and other events held at N-YHS, such as the annual Strawberry and St. Nicholas festivals, Eleanor Roosevelt attending the 1952 
                <emph render="italic">Votes for Women</emph> exhibition, and noted clown Emmett Kelly attending the 1968 exhibition 
                <emph render="italic">Circus Posters from the Days of the Big Top</emph>. The Staff Events and Trustees, Officers and Staff series provide glimpses of some of the people from N-YHS over the years.</p>

                <emph render="bold">History of N-YHS:</emph></p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">“For without the aid of historic records and authentic documents, history would be nothing more than a well-combined series of ingenious conjectures and amusing fables.”</emph> From an 1805 address of the New-York Historical Society</p>
            <p>The New-York Historical Society is New York’s oldest museum. At the time of the Society’s founding in 1804, only 75,000 people lived in New York City, Alexander Hamilton had just been killed in a duel with Aaron Burr, and New York still spelled its name with a hyphen (thus the hyphen in the museum’s name). On November 20, 1804, merchant John Pintard met with ten other New Yorkers to create an organization that would, according to its Constitution, “collect and preserve whatever may relate to the natural, civil, or ecclesiastical History of the United States in general and of this State in particular.” This was a broad mission statement but since there were very few museums at the time, and only one other historical society in the nation, the founders decided it was imperative to collect an inclusive range of materials before they were lost.</p>
            <p>The first meetings of the Society were held rent free in City Hall because New York City’s mayor, DeWitt Clinton, was a founding member. The Society’s library grew significantly in 1809 when Pintard sold his own book and manuscript collection to the New-York Historical Society. As the library and museum continued to grow, its members soon realized that it needed a home. Unable to find a permanent space, the Society moved five times between 1809 and 1857, until it was able to construct its own building on Second Avenue and Eleventh Street.</p>
            <p>In the mid-19th century, the Society’s membership increased along with its library and art collections. Between 1858-1867, the Society acquired the collection of the New York Gallery of Fine Arts, the Abbott collection of Egyptian Artifacts (now at the Brooklyn Museum), and 433 watercolor paintings of John James Audubon. Soon the art and the library were competing for space and it became apparent that the Society had once again outgrown its home. In 1908, N-YHS moved into a newly constructed building at its present location at 77th Street and Central Park West. Renovations in the 1930’s added two new wings and a fifteen-story stack area to the building. Today, the museum and library continue to provide access to collections relating to the political, legal, cultural, mercantile, and social history of the United States and New York in particular.</p>

                <emph render="bold">Administrative History of the Pictorial Archive</emph></p>
            <p>The specific source of the pictorial archive is uncertain, but the bulk of it appears to have been compiled from various sources, mostly N-YHS in-house photographers, but also outside sources. The archive was likely compiled by the staff of N-YHS’s Department of Prints, Photographs and Architectural Collections, known as the Print Room. The pictorial archive as it existed in 1998 was documented in Helena Zinkham 
                <emph render="italic">A Guide to Print, Photograph, Architecture &amp; Ephemera Collections</emph>; it is recorded as PR 46 at page 114.</p>
            <p>Since 1998, the Pictorial Archive was transferred into N-YHS’s institutional archive, and assigned a new call number (NYHS-RG 5). Although the core content of the Pictorial Archive appears to have remained consistent over recent decades, the arrangement and description of the content has changed somewhat over time. Also, additional material has continued to be integrated into the Pictorial Archive, while some material, especially architectural plans and Field Exploration Committee negatives, have been moved to other record groups within N-YHS’s institutional archive. Going forward from 2015, the Pictorial Archive is expected to continue to accrue additional images, but not in a centralized manner as in the past. Most images collected in the future are expected to be archived with their department or other such contextual records.</p>

            <p>A large number of deteriorating negatives documenting the 1937-1938 expansion and renovation of Central Park West were digitized in 2015 by Eleanor Gillers. Information about the digital versions can be found in the Series I (Buildings) description, specifically at the folders concerning the expansion. Other than the digital versions, Series I (Buildings) holds prints of many, though not all, of the original negatives.</p>

            <head>Processing Information Note</head>
            <p>Until the early 2000s, the Pictorial Archive was maintained as a Print Room collection (PR). In the early 2000s, it was transferred to the institutional archive. Many of the photographic prints were processed by Maurita Baldock in 2005. In 2007, Project Archivist Celia Hartmann integrated a substantial amount of additional prints and made some changes and additions to the organization of the material. In 2015, Project Archivist Larry Weimer added a new series for the related negatives from the Print Room files, removed architectural plans into two new record groups (NYHS-RG 3 and NYHS-RG 4), integrated additional prints, and made other, minor changes to the arrangement and description.</p>

There are photographs of the Central Park West building from both before and after the major expansion and renovation of the building in 1937-1938. Both the early twentieth century and 1930s construction projects at Central Park West are documented. The series includes both interior and exterior views.</p>
                    <p>The series also includes a small number of images of N-YHS's various homes from 1804 to 1857. And the series includes images of Richard Morris Hunt's proposals of the 1860s for a building in Central Park for N-YHS and of the summer museum N-YHS maintained at the Thompson homestead on Long Island from 1942-1946.</p>

                        <p>The bulk of the acetate negatives for the photographs in the above five folders were in a deteriorated condition and all but about 24 were discarded in 2016. Prior to discard, all the negatives were scanned. This folder includes the inventory of the digitized negatives and the related filename for the images. There were negatives for which there is no print in the above folders and only the digital image remains. Some of the negatives having a prefix of BU were enclosed in envelopes that had descriptive captions recorded on them; this folder also includes those envelopes. Envelopes with no captions or other information were discarded.</p>

A few snapshots of an N-YHS gallery under construction, and a photograph of George Zabriskie in England dated August 1937, suggest that these might be images compiled by Alexander Wall and Zabriskie during their summer 1937 inquiry into state of the art lighting practices for museums.</p>

                    <p>This series includes images related to various exhibitions that N-YHS held, mostly from the 1940s until the early 1990s. The images primarily include specific objects used in the exhibitions and installation views. There are some images of opening receptions and other events tied to the exhibition. The content is uneven across the series as some exhibitions are heavily represented with images, while others, especially in the earliest years, include fewer images, sometimes only signage. Most of the images are undated and unidentified and so are associated with particular exhibitions often only through their folder labeling, which has been retained as found.</p>
                    <p>The bulk of the images in the series are black and white photographic prints. Some of the files also include other formats, especially negatives and color slides, which are noted at the folder level. Some of the files also include press releases, captions, and other such textual matter. The series includes some non-photographic pictorial matter, including exhibition publicity posters.</p>

                    <p>The Exhibitions series is arranged chronologically and by title of the exhibition. References to months in the date range are to the exhibition opening. Some folders include material from more than one exhibition. A few folders of material related to exhibitions installed in venues other than the N-YHS building are at the end of the series, as are folders of oversize posters.</p>

                        <p>Some of the photographs in this folder appear to be misfiled as they likely relate to a 1968 circus poster exhibition instead. On the other hand, the 1968 exhibition folder includes photographs from this 1953 exhibition. See the folder "Circus Posters from the Days of the Big Top" below at March 1968.</p>

                        <p>Some of the photographs in this folder appear to be misfiled as they likely relate to a 1953 circus exhibition instead. On the other hand, the 1953 exhibition folder likely includes photographs from this 1968 exhibition. See the folder "Circus Time" above at April 1953.</p>

                    <p>This series includes images related to programs held at N-YHS that were generally open to the public, such as concerts, lectures, theatrical works, film series, etc. (Programs limited to particular audiences are found in other series, especially the School Programs and Events &amp; Publicity series.) Images include photographs of the program itself, a reception or related event, and stock publicity photographs of performers, though the specific content for any particular program varies. The series also includes copies of posters and signage for the 1864 public “Lectures on Egypt” sponsored by N-YHS.</p>

                    <p>This series includes photographs of events held by N-YHS that involved public audiences, though sometimes only to a limited or invited extent, or were of a publicity nature. These events included N-YHS’s Strawberry Festival, an annual springtime affair for members, and the St. Nicholas Festival, a longtime tradition of jointly celebrating the December holiday from a Netherlands and New Netherlands perspective and N-YHS’s anniversary. Other events include presentations of donated objects, N-YHS’s sesquicentennial anniversary dinner and reception; commercial photo shoots using N-YHS galleries and objects as backdrop; medal awards; and the History Maker's Gala fundraisers of the 1980s, among others. The series also holds a small number of posters, signage, and other such graphic materials related to N-YHS sponsored events.</p>

                    <p>The Object Images series includes photographs of objects, primarily from N-YHS’s museum collection, though items from the prints and manuscript collections are also included. The bulk of the photographs include only one particular object, but some photographs include multiple objects or N-YHS staff and others displaying, demonstrating or otherwise interacting with an object. Many of the objects are unidentified and the photographs undated.</p>
                    <p>Many of the photographs are of objects not from N-YHS’s collections, and these were likely used in exhibition or other research, such as found in the set of folders with New York City views. Also along these lines are a number of photographs taken in 1949 of the Prentis Murphy home in Connecticut that show the New England furnishings that would be installed at N-YHS in 1951.</p>

                    <p>The series is arranged in alphabetical order by subject matter of the photographs. Most of these subjects were presumably taken from original folders. Additional photographs integrated in 2015 were given subject titles by the processing archivist. A small number of miscellaneous oversize items are found at the end of the container list.</p>

                    <p>The Negatives series includes the negatives for many of the photographic prints found in the other series of the Pictorial Archive record group. It also likely includes some images for which there are not prints. Images include those of exhibitions, buildings (interior and exterior), programs and events, objects, and staff. Formats are both glass and film of various sizes (8x10, 5x7, 4x5, and 35 mm strips). Further information on the subject matter of negatives and the approximate number of related negatives for each subject is included in the container list below. Each negative is individually enclosed in an envelope that often includes descriptive information that is not always noted on the prints , such as date, event, and names of people in the image.</p>
                    <p>Negatives included in this series are only those that were held in the N-YHS Print Room’s negative files. Other negatives were found in some of the folders of prints and were left in those folders; see the above series descriptions for those negatives.</p>

                    <head>Arrangement Note</head>
                    <p>For conservation purposes, the negatives were arranged and housed in boxes by format and by size. Glass slides are boxed separately from film. Within each format, 8x10, 5x7, and 4x5 size envelopes are boxed separately. Generally, the envelope size corresponds with the size of the negative, but some envelopes hold smaller negatives. Most notably, the small 35 mm strips are held in 8x10 sheets/envelopes.</p>
                    <p>Each negative (or 35 mm roll) has a unique control number, which is noted on the envelope housing the negative. Within each box, the negatives are arranged in control number order. This number was often written on the back of a related print thereby linking the print and negative. Accordingly, to facilitate finding a particular negative regardless of format or size, the container list is arranged in control number order. Each entry in the container list indicates a range of control numbers, the format and size of the negatives common to the range (which also indicates the size of the box they are in), and the box number in which the negative will be found.</p>
                    <p>There is not necessarily a negative for every control number in the ranges shown in the container list. Gaps are very common because of the designation of a control number to a negative other than one in the institutional archive, lost or destroyed negatives, or other reason. Because of the gaps, there is often a sharp discrepancy between the actual number of negatives and the number implied by the range. To correct for this, each entry in the container list includes a note concerning the subject matter of the negatives in the range with a parenthetical indicator of the approximate number of actual negatives, for example: “Exhibitions: Early American Toys (4).”</p>

                        <p>In 2016, over 200 acetate negatives related to the 1937-38 building expansion were removed from the collection because of their severely deteriorated condition. Only 24 negatives were in sufficiently good condition to retain. This folder holds those 24, the report on the disposition of the other negatives, and the list of negatives scanned prior to disposition.
