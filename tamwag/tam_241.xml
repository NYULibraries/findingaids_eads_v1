            <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@library.nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Born in Dolina, Poland, on July 1, 1909, Sam Wallach came to the United States with his parents when he was about 10 months old. He grew up in Brooklyn, the oldest of four children. After attending Brooklyn Technical High School, he studied at City College of the City of New York, graduating in 1929. He was a playground director in Brooklyn and then a high school teacher of economics and history. He joined the Teachers' Union and became one if its leaders, serving as President from 1945 until 1948.</p>
            <p>In 1948, Wallach was called by the Hartley Congressional Labor Committee in its investigation of the Teachers Union. He repeatedly asserted that the Committee had no right to investigate personal or political beliefs. His statement, published in 
                <emph render="italic">The New York Times</emph>, was defended by sixty notable thinkers and educators, including Albert Einstein.</p>
            <p>In 1949 The New York State Legislature passed the Feinberg Law, which demanded that the Board of Education seek out subversives and Communists and bar them from teaching. From 1951 to 1956, dozens of city school teachers were dismissed and blacklisted; Sam Wallach was one of the first.</p>
            <p>He worked in a variety of jobs after his dismissal, including creating educational filmstrips for National Teaching Aids, and then took a position at Maimonides Developmental Center advocating for mentally retarded children. He helped formulate strategy for "mainstreaming" students and for establishing residential group homes for the retarded.</p>
            <p>In December, 1976, as he was about to retire from Maimonides, he and nine of the other teachers who had been dismissed in the 1950s, were reinstated and awarded pension benefits by the New York City Board of Education.</p>
            <p>Sam Wallach was married for 56 years to Lottie Tanenbaum. They had two daughters, Joan Wallach Scott and Ruth Wallach Frankel. Wallach died on February 14, 2001, at the age of 91.</p>

                    <p>The bulk of this series is correspondence, much of it in the form of tributes to Rose Russell on celebrating the tenth and twentieth anniversaries of her association with the Teachers' Union. Tenth anniversary tributes (1954) come from union representatives, university professors, attorneys, politicians and religious leaders; correspondents include such well-known individuals as W. E. B. DuBois, Joseph P. Selly, Morris Schappes, Cedric Belfrage and Scott Nearing. In 1964, at the twentieth anniversary celebration, Russell was presented with several leather binders full of tributes. Among them are letters and telegrams from notables such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and his wife, Coretta Scott King, Langston Hughes, Abraham Beame, Frederic Ewen, I. F. Stone, Irving Adler, Linus Pauling, Alexander Meiklejohn, Corliss Lamont, and a host of state senators and assemblymen, journalists, Board of Education members and staff, union members, court officers, representatives of a wide variety of organizations and personal friends. The Irish playwright Sean O'Casey corresponded with Ms. Russell for a number of years. One of his letters in the collection, a moving condolence written on November 20, 1963, after the assassination of President Kennedy, was subsequently published in The New York Times.</p>

                    <p>Approximately 225 black and white mostly 8 x 10 photographs and 13 black and white slides separated from the Sam Wallach Papers. Most of the images document the activities of Rose Russell in the Teachers Union, and its successor organization, the United Federation of Teachers. Many of them were shot by the photographer and Teacher’s Union member, Mildred Grossman. Dates appear range from 1940s to the 1960s.</p>
