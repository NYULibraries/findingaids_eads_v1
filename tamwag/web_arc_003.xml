    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Tamiment Library Web Collection on Organizations, first began by Tamiment in 2007, contains webpages of organizations and other entities concerned with issues related to economic, civil, and social justice from a left and/or progressive perspective. This is an assembled collection, the websites were selected by the archivists. These entities focus on issues ranging from corporate accountability, immigrant rights, unemployment, homelessness, urban justice, healthcare reform, wealth redistribution, and other issues. The collection also contains websites related to environmental and green movements, prisoner rights, the Jewish American Left, peace movements, art and cultural organizations, education and youth movements, animal rights, feminism, housing rights, and other websites related to the Left movement. Tamiment also archives political websites, focusing on Marxian inspired entities, including political parties that identify with or are inspired by Communist, Socialist, or Trotskyist perspectives. </p><p>In addition, there is a huge focus in this collection on the Occupy Wall Street Movement, established in September 2011. Occupy Wall Street is a social movement, started in New York City, that works to reform both the private and public sector. The websites in the collection focus on different aspects and working groups of the movement. Another huge focus of the collection contains websites of those critical of U.S. policy in relation to Guantanamo Detention Camp and its representation governing enemy combatants, prisoner interrogation, the related legal processes and issues, the global detention system established by the Bush administration, including efforts to secure civil and human rights for detainees. Contents include prisoners' testimony and documents from attorneys defending them. </p><p>These websites contain a huge variety of media, which include videos, pdfs, blog postings (including Tumblr and Wordpress blogs), petitions, news feeds, message boards (or forums), and audio. These websites often act to document and update upon the organizations' activities, schedule upcoming events, build awareness of their cause or organization, information on projects the organizations are working on, writings and articles by members of the organization or party, or other activities. </p><p>The web collection documents the publicly available content of the web page, it does not archive material that is password protected or blocked due to robot txt exclusions. Although Tamiment attempts to archive the entirety of a website, certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. This can include videos (Youtube, Vimeo, or otherwise), pdfs (including Scribd or another pdf reader), rss feeds/plug-ins (including twitter), commenting platforms (disqus, facebook), presi, images, or anything that is not native to the site. </p>  </scopecontent>

<p>Tamiment Library, New York University began web archiving in 2007 as part of a grant given by the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIPP) of the Library of Congress. As most unions, left movements, progressive organizations, and others stop creating ephemeral material and paper based collections and move most of their administrative and informational material to the web, Tamiment continued to document the changing face of the labor and left movement into the web era. Tamiment uses the California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service (WAS) as their tool to capture and preserve websites. WAS was created in 2007 and Tamiment is one of its earliest partners. The California Digital Library provides the storage and infrastructure for the project.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Tamiment Library uses the California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service (WAS) to capture websites for historical purposes. Tamiment archivists select websites for capture based on Tamiment's collecting policy. After the site is added, the title of the site is sometimes changed to better reflect the name of the organization/project/event/site.</p><p>Sites are copied by what are commonly known as spiders, robots, or crawlers to index the website. WAS uses the Heritrix web crawler to copy (or capture) the website at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy of the website. In general, the host page of website is captured for up to 36 hours. The initial capture of a website often includes the archived version of websites that have been linked to by the host website. Websites are crawled quarterly, unless contemporary events cause rapid change to content on a website.</p><p>The archivist describes each site using subject headings, a brief description of the site and its contents, and tags. WAS arranges the websites alphabetically and preserves the websites.</p><p>In 2014, finding aids were created from the 23 original projects. Original projects were collected by topic and continue to be maintained by the archivists. Three finding aids were created based on Tamiment Library's Printed Ephemera collection categories, to provide better access across websites and collections in Tamiment Library. These finding aids were created using the XML export tool in WAS and manipulated to create DACS-compliant EAD finding aids. </p>  </processinfo>

Witness Against Torture announces a campaign to close the U.S. detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and end torture and rendition by the U.S. within the first 100 days of the new administration.

The Committees on Correspondence sought to reach out to others on the left outside the Party, and held conferences in 1992 and 1994 to formally establish the new organization.

The CPUSA played a pivotal role in many significant political and social movements of the 20th century. Its Party platform focused largely on working class issues such as fair wages and unemployment, civil rights for racial and ethnic minorities, civil liberties for politically persecuted communities, economic justice for the poor, the unemployed and for immigrants, and international peace efforts. The Party's work left an indelible mark in the arena of progressive politics and made it an influential force in the labor movement, particularly from the 1920s to the 1940s. Its varied political, social, and cultural initiatives attracted the support of a number of prominent artists, intellectuals, and activists, including Woody Guthrie, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Angela Davis. Though the CPUSA's strength and size declined sharply following World War II and the advent of the Cold War and McCarthyism, it remains committed to socialism, peace, economic and social justice, and civil rights and liberties. Today, the CPUSA continues its struggle for socialism, peace, and social and economic justice, and publishes a newspaper, the People's Weekly World (http://webarchives.cdlib.org/site/sw11834j9g), a monthly journal, Political Affairs (http://webarchives.cdlib.org/site/sw1r49hs90), and through its Labor Commission, the online periodical Labor Upfront (captured here: http://webarchives.cdlib.org/site/spec:0000000z7).

The Five were allegedly in the United States to observe and infiltrate the Cuban-American groups Alpha 66, the F4 Commandos, the Cuban American National Foundation, and Brothers to the Rescue. The Five appealed their convictions and the alleged lack of fairness in their trial. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned their convictions in 2005, citing the "prejudices" of Miami's anti-Castro Cubans, but the full court later reversed the five's bid for a new trial and reinstated the original convictions. In June 2009 the US Supreme Court declined to review the case. In Cuba, the Five are viewed as national heroes and portrayed as having sacrificed their liberty in the defense of their country. The main objective of the website is to raise awareness about the Cuban Five and work for their freedom.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Terrorists -- United States -- Florida.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Cuban Americans |z Florida |x Politics and government.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Espionage, Cuban.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref1023" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="website"><did><unittitle>National Committee to Reopen The Rosenberg Case Archived Website</unittitle><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="naf">National Committee to Reopen the Rosenberg Case</corpname></origination><unitdate>Jul 26, 2009- ongoing</unitdate></did><dao ns2:actuate="onLoad" ns2:href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/6338/*/http://ncrrc.org/" ns2:role="translation missing: en.enumerations.file_version_use_statement.service" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="National Committee to Reopen The Rosenberg Case Archived Website" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>National Committee to Reopen The Rosenberg Case Archived Website: January 2011-November 2014</p></daodesc></dao><scopecontent id="aspace_2f1b98795bb955d0515e422615fdc6e7"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>After the trial, "The Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case" was formed. This committee was led by David and Emily Alman. After the executions, the same committee became "The Committee to Secure Justice for Morton Sobell", a codefendant with the Rosenbergs. Sobell was also convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage and was sentenced to 30 years in jail. Approximately ten years later, the National Committee to Reopen the Rosenberg Case (NCRRC) was formed and has continuously been in existence ever since. Aaron Katz, a member of the original committee, served as director for 42 years, until his retirement in 2005. The current co-directors are Leonard Lehrman and Richard Corey. The Committee seeks to have the Rosenbergs and Sobell exonerated and to have the government publicly address and own up to its complicity in the terrible miscarriage of justice that took place in this case. The NCRRC also supports campaigns to redress the unjust incarceration and excessive punishment of prisoners; including the imposition of the death penalty on Mumia Abu-Jamal. The NCRRC deplores the dismal failure of our judicial system and calls for its review and reform.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Rosenberg, Ethel, 1915-1953 |x Trials, litigation, etc. </subject><subject source="lcsh">Rosenberg, Julius, 1918-1953 |x Trials, litigation, etc. </subject><subject source="lcsh">Jewish communists -- United States.</subject><persname source="naf">Rosenberg, Julius, 1918-1953</persname><persname source="naf">Rosenberg, Ethel, 1915-1953</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref1029" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="website"><did><unittitle>National Housing Law Project Archived Website</unittitle><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="naf">National Housing Law Project</corpname></origination><unitdate>Mar 5, 2012 - ongoing</unitdate></did><dao ns2:actuate="onLoad" ns2:href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/6347/*/http://nhlp.org/" ns2:role="translation missing: en.enumerations.file_version_use_statement.service" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="National Housing Law Project" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>National Housing Law Project</p></daodesc></dao><scopecontent id="aspace_6f8379daf85827d408f94b1b5ba2eb3f"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>The National Housing Law Project is a nonprofit national housing and legal advocacy center established in 1968.

The goal of the Torture Archive is to become the online institutional memory for essential evidence on torture in U.S. policy. Many of these documents are available in multiple locations on the Internet and in numerous private collections, thanks to landmark Freedom of Information Act and habeas litigation, leaks from whistleblowers, public relations releases from government, investigative reporting by journalists including the Torturing Democracy team, and Congressional investigations. But the disparate locations, enormous volume of documents, and lack of indexing or standard cataloging have presented real difficulties for users. With support from the Open Society Institute and the JEHT Foundation since 2006, the National Security Archive has undertaken to bring together all these materials in digital formats, organize and catalog them for maximum utility and access, and publish them online in multiple packages including a comprehensive searchable database. By combining released executive branch policy memoranda, legal documents from U.S. and foreign courts, and on-the-ground information about actual practices by the U.S. military and intelligence personnel, the Torture Archive presents a comprehensive view of the war on terrorism, its foundations and its implications. This initial launch of the Torture Archive includes the complete set of declassified Combatant Status Review Tribunal and Administrative Review Board files from the Pentagon, and thousands of documents resulting from FOIA litigation brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Archive and other plaintiffs. The Torture Archive will continue to add documents as they are released through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation or Executive discretion.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Iraq War, 2003-2011 -- Moral and ethical aspects -- United States.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Torture |z United States.</subject><corpname source="naf">Guantánamo Bay Detention Camp</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref2314" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="website"><did><unittitle>National Organization for Women, NYC Archived Website</unittitle><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="naf">National Organization for Women.

Organized as the Workingmen's Party in 1876, the Party was renamed in 1877.Its longtime leader was Daniel De Leon (1852-1914), Marxist author and editor of The People, the SLP newspaper. As the only nationally organized party of socialism in America until 1900, the SLP attracted Socialists of all tendencies to its ranks. However, the Marxist element became dominant by 1890, when the Party was reorganized on a Marxist basis. The SLP has played a prominent role in the economic and political life of the United States. It ran the first socialist presidential campaign in 1892, and fielded national tickets in every presidential campaign through 1976. The SLP's goal is a classless society based on collective ownership and control of the industries and social services, these to be administered in the interests of all society through a Socialist Industrial Union government composed of democratically elected representatives from all the industries and services of the land. Production would be carried on for use instead of profit. The SLP program for achieving this revolutionary change from capitalism to socialism is based on the Marxist tenet that socialism can be achieved only through the classconscious action "of the working class itself." The Socialist Industrial Union program, as the SLP program is known, developed by Daniel De Leon (1852-1914), is a continuation of Karl Marx's ideas on a workers' government. In all essentials--political and economic classwide organization, the breakup of the state, workers' democracy, the seizure of social power by the organized producers and their socialist reorganization of the economy--the SIU program of the SLP conforms to the democratic premises underlying Marx's concept of socialism.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Socialism -- United States.</subject><persname source="naf">De Leon, Daniel, 1852-1914</persname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref1747" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="website"><did><unittitle>Socialist Party of New York City Archived Website</unittitle><origination label="Creator"><corpname source="naf">Socialist Party of New York</corpname></origination><unitdate normal="2009/2014" type="inclusive">Aug 10, 2009-Aug 14, 2014</unitdate></did><dao ns2:actuate="onLoad" ns2:href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/6338/*/http://spnyc.org/home/" ns2:role="translation missing: en.enumerations.file_version_use_statement.service" ns2:show="new" ns2:title="Socialist Party of New York City" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Socialist Party of New York City: Aug 10, 2009-Aug 14, 2014</p></daodesc></dao><scopecontent id="aspace_a6a3d5697823084392310ac2e8f7586a"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>The website of the NYC Local of the Socialist Party USA.

The primary focus is the complex relationship between trade unionism and progressive politics and how this evolved over time. Archival, print, photograph, film, and oral history collections describe the history of the labor movement and how it related to the broader struggle for economic, social, and political change. In 1977 the Robert F. Wagner Archives was established as a joint program of the New York City Central Labor Council and the Tamiment Library. The Wagner is the designated repository for the records of the Council's more than 200 member unions. Today the Library has an extraordinary research collection documenting the history of organized labor in New York and the workers who built the City. Tamiment has one of the finest research collections in the country documenting the history of radical politics: socialism, communism, anarchism, utopian experiments, the cultural left, the New Left, and the struggle for civil rights and civil liberties.
