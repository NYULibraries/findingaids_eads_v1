            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>George Breitman (1916-1986) was born in a working-class neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey in 1916. After graduating from high school, Breitman found work in the Civilian Conservation Corps, and later in the Works Progress Administration. By 1935, he had joined the Trotskyist movement as a member of the Spartacus Youth League, and then as a member of the Workers Party. He also became a leading activist and officer in the New Jersey Workers Alliance, an organization of the unemployed.</p>
            <p>Breitman was a founding member of the Socialist Workers Party in 1938. In 1941 he assumed editorship of the SWP's weekly paper, 
                <title render="italic">The Militant</title>. Drafted and sent to France in 1943, he was able to establish contact with a number of European Trotskyists and to help in the rebuilding of the war-battered Fourth International. After his return to the United States, he was again editor of 
                <title render="italic">The Militant</title>in the late 1940s and early 1950s. From the mid-1950s to the late 1960s, Breitman worked as a proofreader and was a member of the International Typographical Union. In this period he was also the leader of the Detroit branch of the SWP. With his wife Dorothea, and Frank and Sarah Lovell, he initiated the Friday Night Socialist Forum (later called the Militant Forum), a weekly series that attracted a broad range of activists from the labor, left, student and African-American movements. Through this period, Breitman used several pseudonyms, including Albert Parker, Philip Blake, Anthony Massini, John F. Petrone, and Chester Hofla. Returning to New York in the late 1960s, Breitman assumed responsibility for the SWP's Pathfinder Press and was best-known for editing the 14-volume Writings of Leon Trotsky, 1929-1940 (1969-1979), for his work on various collections of the writings of James P. Cannon, and for his pioneering work on Malcolm X, including his Malcolm X Speaks (1965). In the course of these activities Breitman corresponded with leading scholars and added to his already substantial collection of Trotskyist documentation.</p>
            <p>In the late 1970s Breitman opposed the growing trend among the SWP leadership toward what he viewed as a politics focused on the Castroist leadership of the Cuban Communist Party. Among the hundreds expelled from the SWP in the early 1980s, he played a leading role (despite an accumulation of serious illnesses) in establishing the Fourth Internationalist Tendency, which sought to unify U.S. supporters of the Fourth International. Breitman died of a heart attack in 1986.</p>

            <p>The collection contains correspondence, published and unpublished writings, files on various political organizations and activities, bibliographical materials relating to the history of socialism, communism, Trotskyism and other topics, and biographical materials. 
                <emph render="bold">NOTE: This collection (except for the unprocessed Addendum) is housed offsite and advance notice is required for use.</emph></p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I</emph>. Biographical, arranged chronologically, contains an autobiographical sketch, memorabilia from the 1930s and from Breitman's WWII military service, and materials pertaining to several memorial services.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series II</emph>. Correspondence, arranged chronologically, contains the bulk of Breitman's correspondence, and is principally concerned with his political activities as a member of the Socialist Workers Party and later the Fourth Internationalist Tendency. Principal and/or prominent correspondents include: Betsy Barnes, Pierre Broue, James Cannon, Eldridge Cleaver, Farrell Dobbs, Al Glotzer, Daniel Guerin, Joseph Hansen, Gerry Healy, James Kutcher, Walter Lippman, Frank Lovell, Vanessa Redgrave, Ed Shaw, Robert Williams, Murry Weiss, William Worthy. There is also some Breitman correspondence in series III, and throughout series IV.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series III</emph>. Political Organizations &amp; Activities, arranged chronologically, is divided into two subseries, subdivided as follows: A. Socialist Workers Party : 1. General records and activities, 2. Educational Activities, 3. Publications Committee, 4. FBI Files - General, 5. FBI Files - James Kutcher, and B. Other Trotskyist Organizations, arranged alphabetically, which contains files on U.S. organizations preceding the SWP, on the Fourth International, and on those organizations in which Breitman participated after his expulsion from the SWP.</p>
            <p>This rich series contains proceedings, minutes, reports, memos, pre-convention and other discussion and position papers, including those representing minority and/or dissenting viewpoints, as well as some correspondence of Breitman and others, and FBI files. There is coverage of the SWP from its inception, although the greatest concentration of material is from the 1950s-60s and from 1982-85, the period leading up to, and immediately after Breitman's expulsion. For the Newark and Detroit clubs, there are minutes, typescripts of Breitman's talks and lectures, and documentation of Breitman's several runs for public office. Many files deal with views of the USSR, the Shachtman/Workers Party split, Pabloism, and the Cochranite split, including: "Toward Brass Tacks," by James Burnham, 1939; W. Roark (Trotsky) Letters re Opposition, 1940; "Shamefaced Defensism," by Dwight MacDonald, 1940; "Russian Theses," by E. R. Frank, 1948-49; "Pabloism revisited" by Peng, 1955; and an account of a (confidential) interview with Louis Adamic, 1950. Significant files on African Americans include: resolutions written by R. Kirk, 1953; "Why white radicals are incapable of understanding black nationalism," by R. Vernon, 1963; the SWP Black Fraction, 1967-68; and various Breitman lectures and resolutions. Files from the late 1970s - early 1980s document Breitman's political differences with the SWP line, his expulsion and the aftermath. The James Kutcher FBI files pertain to the case of this legless World War II veteran who in 1948 was dismissed from his job as a Veterans Administration clerk in Newark, NJ because of his SWP membership. The other FBI files document the Detroit Friday Night Forum, and the case of the SWP vs the U.S. Attorney General (1980s). (Note: the "Club Executive" is a national SWP committee).</p>
            <p>The bulk of the non-SWP material is from the Fourth Internationalist Tendency, 1984-86. Earlier materials include an extensive file of Communist League of America minutes and other documents, 1929-32, Workers Party minutes/documents, and a history of the New Jersey Workers Alliance, 1935-39. The Socialist Party files focus on the period of the "French Turn" (1936-38), and include minutes of the Left Wing and the Appeal Association.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series IV</emph>: Writings, is divided into eleven subseries: A. Writings, General; B. Party History; C. Malcolm X; D. African-Americans; E. James P. Cannon; F. Leon Trotsky; G. Carl Skoglund; H. Alan Wald correspondence; I. Louis Sinclair Correspondence; J. General Correspondence.; K. Writings by Others.</p>
            <p>Breitman followed closely, and wrote extensively about Malcolm X and African-American struggles. Subseries B &amp; C contain typescripts, including that of a proposed book, Racism in World War II, and The SWP and the Negro Question; a 1939 typescript by J. R. Johnson (aka C. L. R. James) "Preliminary notes on the Negro Question;" ephemera documenting the Black Liberation movements of the late 1950s - early 1970s, notably the Freedom Now Party; transcripts of numerous speeches, interviews and radio broadcasts by Malcolm X; correspondence, including Eldridge Cleaver (see also series I) and James Shabazz; and lists of relevant articles in Trotskyist periodicals.</p>
            <p>Subseries D contains extensive Cannon correspondence, writings and interviews, and Breitman's correspondence re the editing and publication of Cannon's writings. Subseries E contains a selection of Trotsky correspondence and writings (most are photocopies of archival and published materials), including several letters by leading U.S. Trotskyists, sent from Prinkipo to their American comrades, one small file of Natalia Trotsky correspondence, another of Hansen-Trotsky correspondence, and Breitman's correspondence re his editing and publication of the works of Trotsky.</p>
            <p>Breitman corresponded with Carl Skoglund, Minneapolis Trotskyist and Teamster leader, re what appears to have been a biography, and the files contain fragmentary portions of the unpublished typescript. Breitman also corresponded with historian Alan Wald, with Trotsky bibliographer Louis Sinclair and others, including Pierre Broue, Trotsky's grandson (four files covering the years 1972-1983). Breitman also accumulated a number of typescripts by other Trotskyists.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series V</emph>. Lists and Indexes, contains general and special topic contents lists and indexes for the Trotskyist press, principally that of the SWP, and several lists of pseudonyms.</p>
