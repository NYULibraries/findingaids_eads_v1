            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">This collection contains a number of photograph collections, mostly donated by veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, that were deemed too small to catalogue individually. All of the photographs were separated from corresponding Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA) manuscript collections at the Tamiment Library. The images include scenes of the battlefield and daily life in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, Spanish civilians and locales during the War, portraits and group shots of American volunteers in Spain and in the pre- and post-Spanish Civil War years, and images of Dolores Ibarruri, among other subjects.</abstract>

            <p>The sequence of series follows the sequence of ALBA Collection numbers for the corresponding manuscript collections, with a few collections added out of sequence at the end. Folders are arranged alphabetically by topic within each series. The photographic prints are identified by four numbers separated by colons. The first number refers to the collection number, the second to the box number, the third to the folder number, and the fourth to the individual print. For example, the first print in this collection is labeled 36:1:1:1. Negatives are numbered in the same fashion and if there is a matching print, the print number is listed below the negative number.</p>
