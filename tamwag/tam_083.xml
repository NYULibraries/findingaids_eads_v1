    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Jay Leyda (1910-1988) was a leading film historian, best known for his work on Soviet cinema and director Sergei Eisenstein, and on Chinese cinema. He was also a film maker, photographer, archivist, translator, professor of cinema studies at New York University, and was also noted for his Emily Dickinson and Herman Melville scholarship. His wife, Si Lan Chen Leyda (1909- ) was a modern dancer who pioneered the use of Chinese dance elements.</p><p>Jay Leyda was born on February 12, 1910 in Detroit, Michigan, and was adopted and raised by his grandmother in Dayton, Ohio, after his mother's early divorce. In 1930 Jay moved to New York City to work for photographer Ralph Steiner. Leyda was published in <title render="italic">Arts Weekly</title>, exhibited at the Julien Levy gallery, worked for the Workers Film and Photo League, was a founding member of the Film Society and the Film Forum, and arranged music to be played during silent films. At this time he formed a liaison with the activist attorney Carol King and may have joined the Communist Party USA. In 1932 Leyda made his first film <title render="italic">A Bronx Morning</title>, which led to his September 1933 acceptance to the Moscow State Film School, where he studied directing with Sergei Eisenstein. Leyda became a correspondent for <title render="italic">Theatre Arts Monthly</title>and <title render="italic">New Theatre</title>, and using the pen name James Lincoln, was an art critic for the <title render="italic">Moscow News</title>. In 1934 Leyda married Si Lan Chen, whose sister Yolanda worked as a camera operator for Mosfilms. In 1934-35 Leyda worked for Eisenstein as photographer and archivist during the making of <title render="italic">Bezhin Meadow.</title></p><p>In 1936 the Museum of Modern Art offered Leyda the position of Assistant Curator of Films, and he brought to New York a rare print of <title render="italic">Potemkin</title>and other films collected throughout Europe. Leyda expanded MOMA's film collection and wrote pamphlets on the history of film. A 1940 newspaper article alleged he was a subversive agent and his resignation was requested. In 1941 Eisenstein commissioned Leyda to translate and edit a group of essays which became <title render="italic">The Film Sense</title>(1942). Leyda moved to Hollywood in 1942 where he was a technical advisor on films on Russian subjects, including <title render="italic">Mission to Moscow</title>. At this time Leyda began his work on Herman Melville documents (planned as a birthday present for Eisenstein) which led to <title render="italic">The Melville Log: a documentary life of Herman Melville</title>(1951), as well as the <title render="italic">Complete Stories of Melville</title>(1949) and the <title render="italic">Portable Melville</title>(1952). In 1943 he was drafted into the Army but was discharged shortly thereafter. A translation project begun at this time was <title render="italic">The Musorgsky Reader</title>, a 1947 collaboration with Sergei Bertensson, with whom Leyda later co-authored <title render="italic">Sergei Rachmaninoff: A Lifetime in Music</title>, (1956). Highlights of Leyda's continuing work on Soviet cinema include <title render="italic">Film Form: Essays in Film Theory</title>(1949), his 1954 study film from the negative of Eisenstein's unfinished <title render="italic">Que Viva Mexico, Kino, a History of the Russian and Soviet film</title>(1960), and <title render="italic">Eisenstein at Work</title>(1980).</p><p>In 1954 Leyda left Los Angeles and for the next twenty years traveled widely, living abroad much of the time with London as a home base. From 1959-1964, Leyda spent much of his time in Peking at the China Film Archive, resulting in <title render="italic">Dianying (Electric Shadows): an Account of Films and the Film Audience in China</title>(1972). From 1964-1969, Leyda spent much of his time working at the Staatliches Filmarchiv in East Berlin in the German Democratic Republic, and in 1964 he published his <title render="italic">Films Beget Films: a Study of the Compilation Film</title>. Non-film undertakings included <title render="italic">The Years and Hours of Emily Dickinson</title>(1960), and the 1964 performance of the opera <title render="italic">Bartelby the Scrivener</title>, for which Leyda wrote the libretto. In 1973, after brief teaching jobs at Yale and York Universities, Leyda became professor of Cinema Studies at NYU. He published <title render="italic">Voices of Film Experience: 1894-to the Present</title>(1977), regularly visited the USSR and published several collections of Eisenstein materials, and continued to write, lecture, curate, and consult widely on film and other topics. Leyda died on February 15, 1988.</p><p>BIOGRAPHY: SI-LAN CHEN LEYDA</p><p>Si-Lan Chen was born in Trinidad and moved to London in 1912 where she studied dance at the Stedman Academy. In 1926 she joined her father, who had become secretary for Sun Yat-sen and Foreign Minister of the Canton government. In 1927, after Chiang Kai-shek took power, the family fled to Moscow. Chen enrolled in the Bolshoi Ballet School but disliked the discipline and switched to Vera Maya's school. She gave her first important recital in 1930 at the Moscow Conservatory. After adapting her style to reflect a proletarian ideology, she was proclaimed the first modern Soviet dancer. Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s she toured the U.S., Mexico and the West Indies performing in benefits for China relief. In the mid-1940s Chen worked in Hollywood as a choreographer, dance instructor and occasionally appeared on film. Her career was complicated by her long struggle to obtain U.S. citizenship. Chen's biography, Footnote to History, was published in 1984.</p><p><emph render="bold">JAY LEYDA: SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY</emph> </p><p><emph render="bold">I.

Leyda's earliest professional mentors Ralph Steiner and Julian Levy are included with his Dayton friends, dancer Josephine Schwarz and artist Jack Rau. Lincoln Kirstein is a lifelong correspondent of Leyda's along with his sister Mina Curtiss. Leyda's connection with the Museum of Modern Art began long before he was hired there, and is evidenced in his correspondence with Alfred Barr and members of the Rockefeller family. There is also a thick MOMA correspondence file. His early liaison with activist attorney Carol King brought him in contact with the likes of Joseph and Charmian Freeman, and his involvement in founding the Film and Photo League introduced him to Romana Javitz of the New York Public Library's circulating picture collection. Most of the era's literary and film world personalities corresponded with Jay at one time or another. Important and/or frequent correspondents include: James Agee, Walter Benjamin, Paul Bowles, Luis Bunuel, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Aaron Copeland, Joseph Cornell, Walker Evans, Helga Greene, Langston Hughes, Joris Ivens, Paul Jarrico, Elia Kazan, Carol King, Naum Kleiman, Fritz Lang, Joseph Losey, Albert Maltz, Ivor Montagu, Man Ray, Satyajit Ray, Abby Rockefeller, Muriel Rukeyser, Georges Sadoul, Gilbert Seldes, Marie Seton, Lee Strasberg, Thornton Wilder, and Edmund Wilson. Also included is Leyda's correspondence with his family, including his mother, Margaret Smith, grandmother Margaret Leyda, maternal aunts Mary and Josephine Leyda, and his half sister Jane Smith and her family.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref37" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Sub-subseries 1: Alphabetical</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref38" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Abbott, Bernice</unittitle><unitdate normal="1970/1970" type="inclusive">1970</unitdate><container id="aspace_118a459f94b95834c9494821c3135605" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_118a459f94b95834c9494821c3135605" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref39" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Adams, Ansel</unittitle><unitdate normal="1913/1987" type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_bea66dbc6a14f0821f87ecc545340cd4" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_bea66dbc6a14f0821f87ecc545340cd4" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref40" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Adler, Stella</unittitle><unitdate normal="1934/1934" type="inclusive">1934</unitdate><container id="aspace_426935cdfdcd175f9390b42a21daa3f9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_426935cdfdcd175f9390b42a21daa3f9" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref41" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Agee, James</unittitle><unitdate normal="1941/1979" type="inclusive">1941-1979</unitdate><container id="aspace_3efa6da85cba8651161652584dbd34f7" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_3efa6da85cba8651161652584dbd34f7" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref42" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Agha, Dr. M.

clippings, reviews, and some correspondence documenting Leyda's lifelong interest in Soviet cinema and the work of his mentor and sometime collaborator, Sergei Eisenstein. Some are in Russian. There are articles written under the pseudonym James Lincoln for the Moscow News, 1932-36, other articles on Soviet cinema and on Sergei Eisenstein, and letters to Eisenstein. For The Film Sense there are reviews and correspondence. For Kino, there are partial typescripts, reviews, and research notes. There is an unpublished book-length typescript "Letters from Russia" consisting of a selection of letters spanning several centuries. Also included are the research and lecture notes for his reconstruction of Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico. Shorter Leyda writings include book introductions and reviews, film festival and exhibition catalogs, including an early MOMA film festival, and an editing proposal for Potemkin.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref415" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Articles by James Lincoln (aka Jay Leyda)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1932/1936" type="inclusive">1932-1936</unitdate><container id="aspace_5cd21275cb2a0301b76de7332191b588" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">18</container><container parent="aspace_5cd21275cb2a0301b76de7332191b588" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref416" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Articles on Russian Film by Jay Leyda (published and unpublished);

The file on A Bronx Morning contains a partial list of film shots. There are Leyda scripts for unproduced movies, including World Unity (1940s) and Conquistador (1943). The file on Bartelby the Scrivener includes scripts, and there is also some correspondence and publications relating to Leyda's work on Melville and Dickinson. There are several files which contain "Germinations," i.e., various project proposals, and several typescripts by novelist and poet Ben Maddow.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref486" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"A Bronx Morning" (Leyda's first film)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1931/1979" type="inclusive">1931-1979</unitdate><container id="aspace_965fc154c5b25e1b84712697ec05df68" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_965fc154c5b25e1b84712697ec05df68" type="Folder">21</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref487" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>African-Americans in American Film (film list)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1945/1973" type="inclusive">1945-1973</unitdate><container id="aspace_76d421119ff41053fddf6879bd5abeab" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_76d421119ff41053fddf6879bd5abeab" type="Folder">22</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref488" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"American Night" WWII Projects (typescripts)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1913/1987" type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_36720bde5060f50a453045dd9ee69fd3" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_36720bde5060f50a453045dd9ee69fd3" type="Folder">23</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref489" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Armstrong Gallery;

several stages in the lives of Jay Leyda and Si-Lan Chen. It is particularly strong in childhood and family snapshots of each including a small photograph album from each family. There are portraits and snapshots of the pair in the 1930s when they first met. Other highlights in the collection are a series of photoprints by Jack Chen, Si-Lan's brother, taken in China, probably during the mid-40's; an article with photographs in the <emph render="italic">War Worker</emph> (May 1944, Los Angeles) about Si-Lan Chen's dancing; photoprints of the 1964 "Bartelby" production at Oberlin (Leyda wrote the libretto for Aschaffenburg's opera); studio performance and movie production shots of Si-Lan; a snapshot of Luis Bunuel and his sister, Conchita in 1969 at a cottage near Madrid; and a group of graphics and photoprints collected for "Dianyang."</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref655" level="file"><did><unittitle>Art Photographs (Photographed by Jay Leyda)</unittitle><unitdate normal="1929/1930" type="inclusive">1929-circa
