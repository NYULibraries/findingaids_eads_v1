            <p>The third son of John and Francis (Frye) Duer, William Duer was born in Devonshire, England, on March 18, 1747. After a brief stint as aide-de-camp to Lord Clive in India and a few years of work on the family plantations in the Caribbean, Duer moved to the colony of New York in 1773. Duer had, on a previous trip to the area, purchased tracts of land on the North (Hudson) River near Albany. The area, known as Fort Miller, served both as Duer's first residence and as the site of his early financial ventures. Duer set up sawmills, warehouses, and a store, and, by 1776, had built a moderately successful mercantile business based primarily on lumber production.</p>
            <p>A supporter of independence, Duer was an active member of the New York State Convention and went on to serve in the Continental Congress. Duer's public career ended in 1790 when he resigned from the Treasury Department where he had served as assistant secretary under his friend Alexander Hamilton.</p>
            <p>Duer, however, gained much more notoriety from his financial dealings than from his contributions as a public servant. One of his first large-scale projects was to supply Continental troops with food during the Revolutionary War. Duer gained real economic stature, however, in the 1780s with his large land and stock speculations. Prominent among them was the Scioto speculation, through which Duer and his associates secured the right to purchase from the United States a large tract of western lands, which they in turn decided to sell chiefly to capitalists abroad, particularly in France and Holland.</p>
            <p>Duer found himself severely overextended in the 1790s and he faced financial ruin when a suit was brought against him by the government regarding two unbalanced charges while he was with the treasury board. Unable to satisfy his creditors, Duer was arrested on March 23, 1792, and sent to debtors' prison. Duer's economic ties were so wide in the area that his financial collapse set off the first financial panic in New York City.</p>
            <p>Duer remained in prison until his death on May 7, 1799.</p>
            <p>He was married to the former Catherine Alexander, daughter of William Alexander, Lord Stirling, a general in the Revolutionary War. They had one son, William Alexander Duer (1780-1858), who later served as president of Columbia College.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The William Duer Papers consist largely of correspondence (in English, with a few letters in French), accounts, contracts, financial documents and legal manuscripts. They are the products of William Duer, his family, and his associates. The bulk relate to financial activities, with far smaller amounts related to Duer's government work, his Revolutionary correspondence, and his personal life.</p>
            <p>Parts of the collection have been microfilmed onto four reels; those portions of the collection will be brought to the researcher in microfilm format. In the container list below, folders that have been microfilmed are identified by a three-digit number separated by a hypen (e.g., 1-21), which denotes the reel and folder number where the material can be found. Because the physical collection has been rehoused since it was microfilmed, the physical folder and microfilm folder numbers do not always correspond.</p>

                    <p>This series contains letters between Tench Tilghman, aide-de-camp to General Washington, and the Committee of Correspondence of the New York State Convention. The purpose of the Committee was to obtain and communicate war intelligence. Duer was a member of this Committee and was the primary writer of letters to Tilghman. The letters from Tilghman contain comprehensive reports on the status of the American troops, the British troops and the progress of the war. Duer's letters contain questions and observations as well as advice on the war. Note: The letters are 1881 copies of 1776 transcripts.</p>

                    <p>The majority of the correspondence of Duer's son, William Alexander Duer, consists of letters to Hugh Peebles about his financial affairs. The one letter not addressed to Peebles is to John Rutherfurd concerning a speech Duer was to give at the New-York Historical Society on federal and state constitutions.</p>

                    <p>The bulk of these cases were heard in the chancery court of New York during the 1790s. Also included are a few cases from other states. In the majority of cases the direct relationship to Duer is unclear. The New York cases were presided over by Chancellor Robert B. Livingston, Esq. All cases in the collection are incomplete; materials are arranged alphabetically by plaintiff.</p>

                    <p>Duer was held in debtors' prison from 1792 until his death in 1799. In order to preserve order and harmony there, some of the prisoners established a "court" to hear disputes between prisoners. Certain prisoners were elected "judges." Duer was elected a "judge" in 1797. These papers consist of documents of that court, including the facts in various cases, judgments rendered, court attendance records, and records of the elections of the court officers.</p>

                    <p>The two volumes of correspondence include letters received by Duer related mostly to supplying the American Army during the Revolution, the Scioto Land Company, and the settlement of Illinois. They are numbered in pencil from 1-138 (volume 1) and 139-257 (volume 2). The timber contracts pertain to agreements with the governments of Spain and France to supply timber for ship masts and spars. Silas Deane, James Wilson, and Mark Bird were also associated with this enterprise. The remainder of this volume appears to have been used for penmanship practice and casual use.</p>
                    <p>Volumes 1 and 2 are available on reel 3 of the microfilm.</p>
