            <p>The majority of this collection consists of materials created and collected by Charles Laverty through the course of his travel and research intended for a biographical website of Irish Americans. His primary areas of focus were indentured Irish in the American colonies, Irish and Irish Americans in the American Civil War, and members of the United Irishmen involved in the 1798 and 1803 rebellions who later emigrated to the United States. Much of this research material derives from rare 18th and 19th century books and periodicals. In addition to the research files, the collection also includes photographs, ephemera, family materials, and materials documenting Laverty’s involvement in Clan na Gael and the Irish Brigade Association.</p>
