      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Milton (Milt) Wolff (1915-2008) was born in Brooklyn, NY to a working -class family. He
        left school at fifteen and worked in the New Deal 's Civilian Conservation Corps, 1933-1934.
        He later found work in a Manhattan garment factory and became politically active through
        membership in the Young Communist League. When the Civil War broke out in Spain he responded
        to a YCL appeal for volunteers and sailed for Europe, aged 21, in March 1937. He initially
        served as a medic and then saw action in a machine-gun unit of the Washington Battalion in
        the Battle of Brunete in July 1937. The depleted U.S. forces were merged with the Lincoln
        battalion and Wolf rose quickly through the ranks. He led his unit at Belchite and in the
        unsuccessful assault at Fuentes del Ebro, and was promoted to captain during the battle of
        Teruel in January 1938. As the Loyalist forces retreated across the Ebro, and regrouped for
        a final offensive, Wolff, aged 22, became commander of the Lincoln Battalion. </p>
      <p>Wolff met Ernest Hemingway while on leave after Brunete, and forged with him an intense,
        lasting, and sometimes contentious friendship. Hemingway once described Wolff as being "as
        brave and as good a soldier as any that commanded battalions at Gettysburg." On his return
        from Spain Wolff immediately became active in organizing support for Loyalist refugees and
        opposition to the Franco regime. He served as National Commander of the Veterans of the
        Abraham Lincoln Brigade (1939-41 and 1942-54), and worked closely over many years with the
        Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, the Action Committee to Free Spain Now, the U.S.
        Committee for a Democratic Spain, the Civil Rights Congress, and the Smith Trials Bail Fund.
        He campaigned for the integration of the Brooklyn Dodgers, organized aid to Cuba,
        demonstrated against the Vietnam War, and joined with other Lincoln veterans to send
        ambulances to Nicaragua.</p>
      <p>During World War II he worked with the British Special Services before the U.S. entry into
        the War. He volunteered as a private in the U.S. Army infantry in June 1942 and saw action
        in Burma, served under General "Wild Bill" Donovan in the OSS building an intelligence
        network with Communist partisans in Italy, was a liaison to the Spanish Maquis in southern
        France, and served in India. He received a field commission as a lieutenant in Burma.</p>
      <p>After the War he found a variety of jobs, and developed his talents as a writer, painter,
        and photographer. Among his published works are many articles in the <emph render="italic"
          >Daily Worker</emph>, the <emph render="italic">New Masses</emph>, and other left
        periodicals, and an autobiographical novel, <emph render="italic">Another Hill</emph>
        (1994), and a volume of memoirs, <emph render="italic">Member of the Working Class</emph>
        (2005).</p>
