Housed with each letter is a transcript provided by the donor that has been photocopied onto archival quality paper. The reader is cautioned against editorial mistakes in the transcripts.

            <p>David Ludlow Thompson was born in Windham, Ohio on August 28, 1837 and was educated at the Flushing Institute in Flushing, Long Island, where he became a faculty member.</p>
            <p>In August of 1862, he enlisted in the Ninth New York Volunteer Infantry, Company G (also known as Hawkins' Zouaves), and was later transferred to the Third New York Volunteer Infantry, Company B. During his war service, Thompson saw action in the Peninsular Campaign, the Battle of Antietam, and the siege of Charleston. He was taken as a prisoner of war by the Confederate troops after Antietam and was held at Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia for 18 days before being exchanged. In 1863, he spent time in an army hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia.</p>
            <p>David Ludlow Thompson was honorably discharged from military service on June 17, 1865 and died on March 31, 1926.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The David Ludlow Thompson papers consist primarily of letters that Thompson wrote to his mother, Keturah Sayre Thompson, and his friend, Elias A. Fairchild, describing army life, relating his experiences in battle, inquiring about friends and relations at home, and asking to be sent clothing, food, and reading materials. His letters also include detailed descriptions of the weather, the inedible rations, the ill-fitting garments provided by the U.S. Sanitary Commission, his poor attempts to mend his clothing, his bout with scurvy, and having to share his quarters with rodents and insects. His advanced education is evident in his frequent references to the literary canon, using quotes from Milton, Chaucer, and Tennyson to illustrate different situations.</p>
            <p>Most notably, the letters include a description of the Battle at Antietam and a letter sent to Elias A. Fairchild, declaring that David Ludlow Thompson had been declared a prisoner of war after Antietam.</p>
            <p>Also included in the collection are photocopies of articles written by Thompson regarding his experiences during the American Civil War, biographical information, and a wooden spoon that Thompson carved while being held at Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia.</p>

                    <p>Series 3 consists of letters addressed jointly to Keturah Sayre Thompson, Elias Fairchild, and occasionally other family members, including Thompson's sister. While Thompson again asks for news of home and describes the daily ritual of army life in these letters, he also describes his own bout with scurvy near the end of the war. Most notably, this series includes a letter written in August of 1863 from a military hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia describing his experiences there.</p>
