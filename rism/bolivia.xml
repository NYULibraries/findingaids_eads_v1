Rubin, founder and director of RISM, and Dr. Lambros Comitas, assistant director of RISM, anthropological and epidemiological teams studied six ecologically distinct communities in order to identify major health problems and to assess the implications of rural social organization to facilitate the work of development agencies. The Bolivia Project generated thousands of documents, including correspondence, accounting records, indexed field notes, laboratory processing records, surveys and questionnaires, epidemiological data, maps, photographs, microfiche and microfilm. The collection also includes appended items from an exhibition,

            <p>The Bolivia Project (1964-1967) consists of 200 linear feet of materials, including correspondence, accounting records, biographical index cards, indexed field notes, epidemiological and ethnographic studies and reports, laboratory processing records and results, blood typing cards, health questionnaires, computer generated charts, questionnaires and surveys that focus on household sanitation data and investigation of infant feeding habits, community censuses, maps, oversized charts, microfiche, microfilm, articles, unpublished manuscripts and accounting records, photographs, and videotapes. Material from a 1997 exhibit,

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>In 1964, at the request of the U.S. Peace Corps, the Research Institute for the Study of Man (RISM) initiated a three-year epidemiological and ethnograpic research project in Bolivia.</p>
            <p>Headed by Dr. Vera Rubin, RISM's founder and director, and Lambros Comitas, assistant director, the Project employed more than eighty social and medical scientists and assistants. Organized as teams, researchers lived in six rural communities. Each community represented a major organizational type, ranging from minimally stratified and nonpolitical to complex stratification and politically revolutionized. Four of the communities were situated in the rural towns of Villa Abecia, Coroico, Reyes and Sorata, and two were in the Indian pueblos of Compi and San Miguel (see map).</p>
            <p>The region had been impacted by major social reform in 1952 when the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR) took power. New, politically mobilized campesinos from the rural Aymara and Quechua populations redistributed part of the country's national resources. The MNR made a number of efforts to integrate the society, which was stratified yet culturally heterogeneous and regionally oriented. Some of these most important efforts involved land reform, nationalization of the tin mines, establishment of institutional supports for the working population, and the dramatic expansion of rural education.</p>
            <p>The project had two interrelated research objectives. The epidemiological team attempted to define the major problems of health and disease in rural Bolivian communities, taking into account the different ecological regions of the country. The ethnographic team delineated the major social features of each community by conducting a comparative study of social relations and social processes. Numerous volumes of ethnographic and sociological data were generated and subsequently used in comparative studies that included an extensive social survey of heads of households. This epidemiological and ethnographic research became fundamental to the planning of future community development programs and provided insight into the dynamics of community problems and community change.</p>
            <p>However, the complexity of the research and analysis, as well as the interest in the application of scientific knowledge, resulted in more than a third of total project funding being provided by RISM. The methodological and theoretical development of the Project, as well as the research findings, were detailed in a report developed during the period of study. Quarterly reports, describing the work and the course of research, were filed with the Peace Corps. The epidemiological teams systematically sampled each community, and the results were entered into a database. The material was subsequently organized, analyzed, and used to prepare the final epidemiological report and summary of findings on health levels and health behavior. The final publication, 
                <title render="italic">Epidemiological Studies in Bolivia</title>, was published in November 1967 and translated into Spanish (
                <title render="italic">Estudios Epidemiologicos en Bolivia</title>) by the epidemiological research team.</p>
            <p>The ethnographic report was published in 1969 as 
                <title render="italic">Changing Rural Bolivia </title>and in
                <title render="italic"> </title> 1971 by Oxford University Press as 
                <title render="italic">Changing Rural Society</title>. In addition, a number of articles, reports, theses and doctoral dissertations resulted from the project research.</p>

The CSO is an outline that was used to standardize and index the information recorded in the field notes generated by each anthropologist. The one exception is Compi, where the anthropologists were already present in the community conducting their own research. For Compi, only Biographical Index and Member of Household Number designations exist. These forms document geographic environment, population demographics, history and development, institutional systems, the sociopolitical system, community and private health, and the Peace Corps program.</p>

                    <p>Partly as a result of the RISM Bolivia Project (1964-1967), the United States Office of Education in 1968 and 1969 sponsored a study of rural education in Argentina, Bolivia, and Jamaica. The principal investigator of this study was Lambros Comitas, then Professor of Anthropology and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, and Associate Director of the Research Institute for the Study of Man.</p>
                    <p>The Bolivia CV Recordings, an integral part of this comparative study, were taped by Lambros Comitas in 1969 using a Sony Videocorder and CV reel-to-reel videotape for helican scan video recorders.</p>
