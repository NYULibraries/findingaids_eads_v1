        the American Medical Bureau for Spanish Democracy during the Spanish Civil War. The Rose
        Weiner Papers (dated 1920-1995) contain photographs, correspondence, and personal items
        related to Rose Weiner’s life and her work as a nurse during the Spanish Civil War. The bulk
        of these materials were contained in Weiner’s personal scrapbook, which contained
        photographs of Weiner in her youth, Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers during the Spanish
        Civil War, and Weiner’s family later in life. Also included in these materials are nursing
        certificates, a small amount of personal correspondence, and letters from the American Red
        Cross and War Manpower Commission regarding her application to serve as a nurse during World
        War II.</abstract>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Rose Weiner (1908-1995) was born in Lyubar, Russia into a Jewish family. As a child Rose
        experienced the harsh conditions of the Russian Revolution and counter-revolution while she,
        her mother and siblings awaited word from her father who had migrated to the United States.
        On September 25, 1921, Rose and her family arrived at the Port of New York before moving to
        Milwaukee. Weiner moved back to New York for school and attended the Montefiore Hospital
        School of Nursing from 1929-1932. After graduation, Weiner accepted a position at Montefiore
        Hospital. In March 1937 she sailed to Spain as an American medical volunteer in support of
        the Loyalist forces in the Spanish Civil War. Weiner worked as a floor nurse in a
        convalescent hospital, of which she was soon given charge. She spent several months working
        on the front lines before taking charge of a surgical hospital. During her last six months
        in Spain, she served as chief nurse of a 1,500-bed surgical and medical hospital. Weiner
        returned to New York in 1939 and continued work at Montefiore Hospital. Although she applied
        for nursing positions in the American Red Cross, Army Nurse Corps and War Manpower
        Commission during WWII, Weiner was never granted any of these positions, on the grounds that
        she did not meet physical requirements. Soon after her attempts to serve in the war, Weiner
        left Montefiore and began work for New York City as a Public Health Nurse. Meanwhile, she
        worked toward her Bachelor of Science degree at Hunter College. Weiner later worked as a
        school nurse until she retired in the 1970s.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Rose Weiner Papers (dated 1920-1995) contain photographs, correspondence, and personal
        items related to Rose Weiner’s life and her work as a nurse during the Spanish Civil War.
        The bulk of the materials in this collection were originally housed in a scrapbook. The
        scrapbook was dismantled, but photocopies of the intact scrapbook are included in the
        collection. Items contained in the scrapbook largely consisted of photographs of Weiner in
        her youth, Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers during the Spanish Civil War, and Weiner’s
        family later in life. It also contained nursing certificates, a small amount of personal
        correspondence, and letters from the American Red Cross and War Manpower Commission
        regarding her application to serve as a nurse during World War II. Materials added to the
        collection in 2017 include collected publications related to Abraham Lincoln Brigade
        volunteers and medical staff in Spain during the civil war. They also include photocopies of
        correspondence between Weiner and Fredericka Martin (dated 1969), and a photograph of Weiner
        in a white nursing uniform (dated circa 1928).</p>

      <head>Processing Information</head>
      <p>Materials in this collection were originally housed in a scrapbook that has been
        dismantled. Materials contained in the scrapbook were separated into series by format.
        Photographs from the scrapbook were initially established as a separate collection, the Rose
        Weiner Photographs (ALBA PHOTO 116). In 2017, the photograph collection was reintegrated
        into the Rose Weiner Papers (ALBA 116) as Series III: Photographs, 1920s-1990s. An accretion
        of publications related to the Abraham Lincoln Brigades and a photograph of Rose Weiner was
        also added to the collection in 2017 and integrated into the existing arrangement.
        Publications were added to Series II: Subject Files, while the photograph was added to
        Series III: Photographs in the folder “Weiner, Rose: American Medical Bureau.”</p>

          <p>Series III: Photographs, 1920-1995 contains photographs from Rose Weiner’s scrapbook
            including images of her childhood, family, and as a student at Montefiore Hospital
            School of Nursing. There is one image of Weiner’s father in the United States prior to
            the family’s arrival in the United States, an image of mother Eva Rubenstein with Rose,
            Dora, Milton, Sam and Florence in Lyubar, Russia, and an image of the Weiner’s neighbors
            and cousins visiting the grave of Alexi Weiner, who was killed in a Russian pogrom.
            Additional photographs document the American Medical Bureau’s work during the Spanish
            Civil War including images of Jaime de Guzman, Captain T. Blin, medical personnel, and
            unidentified troops fighting for the Spanish Republican Army.</p>
