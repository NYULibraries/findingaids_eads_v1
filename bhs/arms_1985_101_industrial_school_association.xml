    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Industrial School Association and Home for Destitute Children Annual Reports collection comprises 0.4 linear feet of materials and spans the dates 1859 to 1910, with the following date gaps: 1854-1858, 1862, 1872, 1897, 1899, 1903, 1904, and 1960. It consists almost entirely of annual reports, which feature financial statements, summaries of activities and accomplishments for each year, lists of donations and donors, as well as the Association's constitution and by-laws. These reports do not feature the names or adoption records of any residents of the Home for Destitute Children. A particular strength of the collection is its insight into society's attitudes regarding poverty during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, specifically the perceived relationship between poverty and moral depravity. There is also one folder of typed and handwritten documents.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Brooklyn Industrial School Association was founded in 1854 and formally incorporated in 1857 to provide education, food, and shelter to orphaned, abandoned, and otherwise impoverished children in Brooklyn. It operated schools throughout Brooklyn that enrolled several hundred students per year, as well as the Home for Destitute Children, built in 1862 on Butler Street (now Sterling Place) near Flatbush Avenue. The Association's approach to its work was expressly religious in nature, with a strong emphasis placed on Christian moral principles. It was founded by female members of several Brooklyn churches, and thereafter its staff and Board of Managers was comprised entirely of women representing the different Christian denominations of Brooklyn.</p>  </bioghist>
