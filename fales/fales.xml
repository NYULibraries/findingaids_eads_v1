    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Fales family can claim ancestry back to the Puritan settlers who arrived in New England on the Mayflower. Eventually, the family became centered in Bristol, Rhode Island. Descendants of the Fales family have been variously involved in politics (Andrew Dunlap, 1796-1835), aviation, yachting, philanthropy and other assorted businesses and interests. DeCoursey Fales (1888–1966) collected rare books and manuscripts. In 1957, he donated his collection to NYU in memory of his father, Haliburton Fales. An in-depth description of the family and its history up to 1919 can be found in De Coursey Fales's 'The Fales Family of Bristol, Rhode Island' (Series III, box 6 and 7 of this collection).</p><p>Sources:

    <head>Provenance</head>
<p>The Fales Family Papers were acquired between 1957-1997 through generous contributions made by DeCoursey Fales and Haliburton Fales, II. The original portion of the collection, relating to DeCoursey Fales, was acquired sometime after the founding of the Fales Library in 1957. The first donation by Haliburton (December 1996), consisted of the R.B. Taney letter to Benjamin Stone (1836) and three copy books of the late Haliburton Fales Jr. The second donation (March 1997), included three boxes of archival materials from the Fales Family. Subsequent donations were made in 2000, 2001, and 2003. These materials are described at the end of the collection as accretions.</p>  </custodhist>
