            <abstract id="ref4103" label="Abstract">The original goal of Artists Space was to support young, emerging artists, specifically those who had not yet had a solo show in New York City. Artists Space became one of the most influential alternative non-profit arts spaces in the Downtown New York Scene, hosting a variety of prominent exhibitions including Adrian Piper’s "It’s Just Art" (1981), Nan Goldin’s "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing" (1989), Douglas Crimp’s "Pictures" (1977), and Michael Asher’s "Untitled" (1988). The bulk of the material is exhibition files, and includes research files, coordination, opening, reception, sales, touring, and dismantling. This collection also preserves artists' materials (CVs, catalogues, photographic elements), correspondence, drafts of published works, financial records, gallery floorplans and maps, grant applications, loan and legal documentation, and promotional matter in the form of brochures, postcard announcements, newsletters, posters, and press releases.</abstract>

            <p>Materials in the Artists Space Archive document the workings of this late-twentieth-century art organization and all its attendant functions. Because exhibitions are at the core of Artists Space programming, the bulk of this material includes files that record exhibition research, coordination, opening, reception, sales, touring, and dismantling. This collection also preserves artists' materials (CVs, catalogues, photographic elements), correspondence, drafts of published works, financial records, gallery floorplans and maps, grant applications, loan and legal documentation, and promotional matter in the form of brochures, postcard announcements, newsletters, posters, and press releases. Documentation of Artists Space events and exhibition programming are also preserved in the form of images: slides and prints, drawings, paintings and collages, floppy disks, zip disks, cd-roms, and other digital media containing images, films, and audio. The research materials for the Artists Space 15th and 25th Anniversary publications also provide an instructive history of the organization.</p>

            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>Artists Space was founded in 1972 by arts administrator Trudie Grace and critic Irving Sandler as a pilot project for the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA), with the goal of assisting young, emerging artists, and was originally called the Committee on Visual Arts, Inc. The original goal of the Committee was to support young, emerging artists, specifically those who had not yet had a solo show in New York City. Quickly thereafter, Artists Space became financially independent of the State Council and over the years became one of the most influential alternative non-profit arts spaces in the Downtown New York Scene. Artists Space’s original guidelines stipulated that well-known artists would select other artists to exhibit. Throughout the years, the gallery discarded this model, but retained the 
                <title render="doublequote">Artists Select Artists</title> model for one show a year. Throughout the years, Artists Space, as a non-profit arts organization, has retained its commitment to exhibiting new and experimental artworks, and has expanded its scope to include readings, panel discussions, film programs, and special series, including the International Projects Program, Selections from the Artists File, and others. Artists Space moved from its original location at 155 Wooster Street to 105 Hudson Street in 1977, to 223 West Broadway in 1984, and to its current location at 38 Greene Street in 1993.</p>
            <p>Provocative programming has been the hallmark of Artists Space throughout its history, and a variety of prominent exhibitions are well-represented in the collection, including Adrian Piper’s "It’s Just Art" (1981), Nan Goldin’s "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing" (1989), Douglas Crimp’s "Pictures" (1977), and Michael Asher’s "Untitled" (1988). "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing" sparked controversy, when, due to an objection to an essay by David Wojnarowicz in the catalogue, the National Endowment for the Arts pulled its funding in the wake of Newt Gingrich’s moral crusade in Congress. The attendant controversy is well-documented in the collection. Artists Space has also given many artists their first chance at the spotlight, amongst them: Joan Jonas, Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons, Sherrie Levine, Louise Lawler, Laurie Anderson, Barbara Bloom, John Miller, John Baldessari, Jack Smith, Andrea Fraser, Haim Steinbach, Tim Rollins, Lyle Ashton Harris, Ashley Bickerton, Peter Halley, Lari Pittman, Group Material, Stuart Sherman, Barbara Kruger, Laurie Simmons, Anthony McCall, Fred Wilson, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Mike Kelly, Judith Barry, Michael Smith, Robert Longo, and Jenny Holzer.</p>

            <head>Arrangement</head>
            <p>All efforts were made to preserve the original arrangement of the collection. The collection has been divided into eight series reflecting this arrangement. Within each series, items are arranged chronologically by event or exhibition opening date. The Book Files series is an exception, and is arranged alphabetically, then chronologically. The Media series is also an exception in which items are arranged alphabetically. The archivist transcribed folder titles exactly from original folder titles given by the organization. When they were changed, due to error or omission, they are denoted with brackets. The researcher should expect to find overlapping of materials throughout all series. Oversized archival materials from the various series are listed at the end of the finding aid. The first seven series are available for research while access copies of the media originals are not available. This collection is arranged into the following series:</p>
            <p>Series I: Exhibition Files
                <lb/></p>
            <p>Series II: Promotional Materials

                    <p>This series consists of a sampling of Artists Space newspapers, sent out as exhibition announcements, as well as a small number of production materials for these newspapers, documenting the process of their creation. In addition, there is a sampling of postcards and brochures, most of which come from the Film Series program, and span the years from 1986 to 1992. The brochures and postcards are duplicated in Series I: Exhibition Files.</p>

                    <p>These materials are arranged alphabetically, then chronologically. This series includes documentation generated by the research, fundraising, and production of the never-produced 15th anniversary book, intended to be published in 1988. In addition, this series preserves materials generated by the production of the 25th anniversary book published in 1998, 
                        <emph render="italic">5000 Artists Return to Artists Space: 25 Years</emph>. This book is available at Fales. It is clear that the 25th anniversary book relied heavily on research materials originally generated by the production of the 15th anniversary book. The materials in this series include drafts, budgets, correspondence, notes, images, funding sources, brochures, catalogs, slides, interview typescripts, chronology, notes, and other research materials.</p>

                    <p>This series consists of materials generated by the Independent Project Grant program administered by Artists Space. These grants were provided to artists to stage exhibitions, either solo or in groups. These were available to unrepresented New York artists to put on shows in non-commercial spaces in the New York area. The material consists of grant proposals, work samples, correspondence, and documentation of grant spending, budgeting and planning.</p>
