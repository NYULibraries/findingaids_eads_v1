    <head>Processing Information note</head>
<p>The collection was arranged and described by archivist John Zarrillo, 2013-2014. </p><p>Acquisitions and processing intern Deborah Marks assisted in assembling the finding aid.</p><p>The collection was originally stored in record cartons loosely organized in rough chronological order. Each box typically contained files dating from a single year (e.g., 1898) or a consecutive range of dates (e.g., 1906-1910). While some records relating to individual case files were grouped together (bound with string), others were separate; material related to the same case was frequently scattered across multiple record cartons.</p><p>Folder titles were typically created by the processing archivist as described in the arrangement note for each series. Most records in the collection directly relate to individual cases and are grouped into the Case Files series. Other series were created to reflect the function or form of the records (e.g., correspondence not related to specific cases comprises the Correspondence series and records related to the opening of city streets comprise the Streets series). Date ranges for the collection and each series are derived from the contents of the records.</p><p>Some oversized materials within each series have been separated and stored in flat boxes.</p><p>Certain fragile materials in the collection have been replaced with photocopies for preservation purposes.</p><p>Please note that the following abbreviations are utilized: Ave. for avenue; Blvd. for boulevard; Pl. for place; Rd. for road; St. for street;</p><p>Numbered streets are expressed numerically [example: 1st Pl., 7th Ave., 59th St., etc.]</p><p>Many street names have changed since the 19th century. These changes are explained in the notes field for each folder when possible. Please note that the streets that run parallel to the East River in Williamsburg (Kent Ave., Wythe Ave., Berry St., etc.) were originally numbered (1st St., 2nd St., 3rd St., etc.).</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection consists of the records of the office of the Corporation Counsel of the City of Brooklyn and, following the 1898 consolidation of the Greater City of New York, the records of the Brooklyn office of the Corporation Counsel of the City of New York. The collection spans the years 1843 to 1920 (bulk dates 1850 to 1905) and measures 113 linear feet. The bulk of the collection comprises legal documents related to complaints filed against the city. Common complaints include personal injury claims, property damage claims (mostly related to the city's sewer system), assessment disputes, and civil service grievances. The Corporation Counsel was also responsible for overseeing the opening of city streets and the collection includes a series of records related to this activity. The collection also includes correspondence with various city departments (Water Supply, Finance, Police, etc.) that sought legal advice.</p><p>While the majority of the collection is Brooklyn specific, portions of the collection deal with other nearby areas, especially Queens County and Long Island. Specifically, from 1896 to 1899, there are several complaints related to Long Island City. There are also a number of files related to property acquired by the City of Brooklyn (and later the City of New York) in the Towns of Jamaica and Hempstead on Long Island relating to the expansion of the city's water supply.</p><p>On the whole, the collection documents the activities of the Brooklyn Corporation Counsel as well as the day-to-day legal issues that the citizens of Brooklyn faced in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It also documents the rapid expansion of Brooklyn's infrastructure, especially its streets and water supply.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>The charter for the City of Brooklyn that consolidated the Village of Brooklyn with the Town of Brooklyn was approved in 1834. The charter established the city's municipal government which consisted of a mayor and a common council. The common council was granted the power to appoint various positions, including a separate Attorney and Counsel. These positions were typically occupied by a single appointee, except from 1847 to 1850 when they were held by two separate appointees. The 1873 charter of the City of Brooklyn established a single Attorney and Counsel as head of the city's Law Department. The charter specified that the Attorney and Counsel would serve as chief legal advisor for the mayor, the common council, and the various city departments established over the years. The Attorney and Counsel was also charged with managing the proceedings necessary for opening, closing, or otherwise improving city streets. By 1885, the position title was changed from Attorney and Counsel to Corporation Counsel. In 1898, the City of Brooklyn was consolidated into the Greater City of New York. The Brooklyn office of the Corporation Counsel subsequently reported to the Corporation Counsel of the City of New York and was headed by an Assistant Corporation Counsel. The Brooklyn office handled all legal matters that affected the Borough of Brooklyn and Kings County.</p>  </bioghist>

Records that relate to the same case have been grouped together by the processing archivist into individual folders.</p><p>Folder titles are formatted as follows:</p><p>Individual (Surname, Forename) or Corporate Name – Description of the case</p><p>Example: Samuels, Esther - Hudson Ave. sidewalk injury</p><p>The location with respect to the case is included in the folder title if known.</p><p>Please see the Processing Information note for additional general information regarding the arrangement of the series in this collection.</p></arrangement><scopecontent id="aspace_588b05f4d3ab968a3d49ac8e4b9eb231"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This series is comprised of case files documenting legal complaints filed against the City of Brooklyn (and after 1897, the City of New York) for a variety of matters including personal injuries, property damage, compensation for goods and services, civil service disputes, and assessment and tax disputes. The series also includes a smaller number of complaints filed by the city against individuals and corporations for legal violations or property foreclosures.</p><p>The records span the years 1849 to 1920 (bulk dates 1894 to 1905).</p><p>The files were compiled by the office of the Corporation Counsel and contain legal documents including, but not limited to, affidavits, briefs, complaints, examination transcripts, and various notices. The files may include related correspondence, legal notes, and other supporting documents.</p><p>The majority of the personal injury cases involve injuries that occurred on city streets and sidewalks although a smaller number involve other city property such as parks and bridges (including the Brooklyn Bridge). Some cases name local railroad companies as co-defendants. The files sometimes include reports from police and/or doctors.</p><p>Property damage claims primarily relate to overflowing sewers. Neighborhoods that were especially prone to flooding include Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, Fort Greene, and Boerum Hill/Gowanus. These files sometimes include lists of household or commercial goods and their values. The series includes some claims for property damage in areas outside of Brooklyn, especially the Town of Hempstead on Long Island, for damage related to Brooklyn's water supply such as flooding from pumping stations and the diversion of creeks and other waterways.</p><p>There are a number of claims for unpaid goods and services provided to the city. These complaints are sometimes related to contract disputes between the plaintiffs, the city and other contractors. Claims related to construction or alterations of city buildings (such as schools and police stations) sometimes include specifications for the work.</p><p>The series also includes disputes related to civil service employment, typically dismissals or claims for unpaid salaries.</p><p>Another large component of the series comprises complaints related to assessments and other property matters. These files may include documents providing details about property ownership such as deeds and property searches. A small number of complaints include property maps.</p><p>Other matters addressed in the series include railroad company disputes, gas and electric utility disputes, election disputes, license disputes (especially liquor licenses and licenses to hold athletic contests), building and health violations, county jail discharges, estate disputes, and a small number of criminal matters.</p><p>While the majority of the series is Brooklyn specific, from 1896 to 1899, there are a number of complaints relating to Long Island City that concern assessments, civil service, or claims for goods and services.</p><p>The legal repercussions of the consolidation of the Greater City of New York are also evident in the series. Civil service complaints about disparate pay for similar positions in the former municipal governments resulted in litigation. Also of note is a dispute arising from the debt apportionment of Queens County.</p><p>Additionally, this series includes a small number of complaints arising from other areas of New York City, such as Manhattan and Staten Island.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref16_y6x" level="file"><did><unittitle>Spooner, Edwin B. against Samuel B.
