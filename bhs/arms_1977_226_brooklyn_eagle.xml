    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph> was a daily newspaper that was published in Brooklyn for over 114 years. Founded in 1841 by Isaac van Anden and Henry Cruse Murphy, the newspaper was originally named the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle and King's County Democrat</emph>. In 1850, the name was changed to the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph>. By the early 1860s, the newspaper had become one of the most widely read papers in the United States. Over the years the newspaper persevered through both good and bad times, experiencing declines in readership and circulation but also winning accolades such as receiving four Pulitzer Prizes. </p><p>In 1938, the newspaper underwent another name change when it became the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph>. Frank D. Schroth bought the paper in 1940 and continued to publish it until 1955 when the <emph render="italic">Eagle </emph>ceased publication during a lengthy strike by the New York Newspaper Guild. Bankruptcy followed. Between 1960 and 1963, the <emph render="italic">Eagle </emph>once again resumed publication, this time as a weekly paper (though for a short time as a daily). The run was short-lived and the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph> office closed in December 1963. In 1996, J. Dozier Hasty, the owner and publisher of Brooklyn Heights Press, purchased the Eagle's name and logo and began to publish the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle &amp; Daily Bulletin</emph>. As of 2011, the <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle &amp; Daily Bulletin</emph> remains a daily newspaper, published five days per week.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
