            <p>Carl Marzani (1912-1994), an Italian-American immigrant radical, was a writer, editor, publisher, and also produced political documentary films. During the late 1930s he received a degree at Oxford University, joined the anarchist Durruti Column during the Spanish Civil War to fight against the fascists, hitch-hiked around the world with his first wife, Edith, and then served briefly as a Communist Party, USA, organizer on New York City's Lower East Side. During World War II, he worked in the United States government's Office of Strategic Services; he also worked for the State Department in 1945 and 1946. He served almost three years in prison, from 1947-1950, for concealing his prewar Party membership during the period of his government employment. He lived and worked in New York City most of his life.</p>
