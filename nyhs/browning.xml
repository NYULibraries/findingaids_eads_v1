            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Irving Browning (1895-1961), a self-taught photographer and cinematographer, was born in New York City. Browning opened a commercial photograph studio at 110 West 40th Street in 1922 or 1923; his younger brother, Sam, occasionally worked with him as a photographer. A former silent film actor and comedian of the 1910s, New Yorker Irving Browning photographed both exteriors and interiors of skyscrapers, art deco theaters, hotels, apartment buildings, and suburban residences, and documented the lifestyles of New Yorkers during the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
            <p>The Irving Browning Studio received commissions from architectural firms, advertising agencies, and magazines to photographically illustrate both the realistic and idealistic urban environment of Depression-era New York City. As construction in Manhattan flourished despite the Depression, Browning was hired to document such new architectural landmarks as the Chrysler Building, the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, the RKO Roxy and Earl Carroll theaters, and the towering Empire State Building.</p>
            <p>Through both his professional and personal work, Browning also captured some of the more intimate daily experiences of city residents. Many of his photographs from the 1930s meditate on the contrasts of poverty and wealth; they focus on poor Lower East Side peddlers, former businessmen selling apples in the aftermath of the stock market crash, and shantytowns as well as on such things as well-heeled shoppers perusing fashionable window displays and the leisure activities and lifestyles of the wealthy.</p>
            <p>Browning was an innovator who took an avid interest in the technical aspects of photography. His correspondence hints at his interest in the evolution of color film, in advances in motion picture technologies, and in expanding the ability of still photographs to communicate. Browning's creative and sometimes frenetic photomontages were popular among magazine advertising clients. His novel circular reflection, bas-relief, and expansive architectural views graced the pages of The New York Times. Browning's technical interests also extended to the history of photography and cinematography. He amassed a large collection of vintage cameras, projectors, lenses, stereoscopic viewers, and motion picture equipment. Browning lectured on and exhibited his collection at colleges, schools, and professional organizations throughout the New York area.</p>
            <p>In later years, Browning focused his career on creating motion pictures. He worked in a variety of capacities in the film industry, from his early work as an actor to his later work in the 1930s and 1940s as a director, producer, and cameraman. A few of his short films gained a measure of notice, including the documentary 
                <title render="italic" type="simple">City of Contrasts</title> (1931), and the short biopic 
                <title render="italic" type="simple">Women in Photography</title> (1941) which focused on the careers of Ruth Alexander Nichols, Toni Frissel, Bernice Abbott, and Margaret Bourke-White.</p>
            <p>Browning was a member of a number of professional organizations, including the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, the American Television Society, and the Master Photo Dealers' &amp; Finishers' Association. His photographs were exhibited jointly with such well-regarded contemporaries as Margaret Bourke-White, Ralph Steiner, and Bernice Abbott. By 1940, Browning had founded and was serving as president of the Camera Mart, Inc., a photographic and motion picture equipment store which he owned until his death in 1961.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
                    <p>Series I consists of 1,885 gelatin silver photographs measuring 8 x 10 inches or smaller, depicting a wide range of New York buildings, institutions, parks and squares, theaters, signs, and street scenes. Photographs are arranged alphabetically into the following subject-based subseries: Advertising; Aircraft and Aeronautics; Apartment Buildings; Banks and Financial Institutions; Browning, Irving; Chinatown; Churchs and Synagogues; Construction and Construction Workers; Depression, the Great; Eagles; Factories and Industry; Harbor and Waterfront Views; Hospitals; Hotels; Lower East Side; Monuments and Statues; Night Views; Occupations; Office Buildings; Parks and Squares; Photomontages; Police Stations; Portraits; Public Buildings and Institutions; Rain Views; Residences; Restaurants; Roofs and Roof Gardens; Ships, Boats and Ferries; Shoes; Shops and Shopping; Skylines and Cityscapes; Sports and Recreation; Streets and Avenues; Television and Radio; Theaters; Tourists; Transportation; Utilities; Winter Views; and Miscellaneous/Unidentified. This series contains architectural photographs taken for clients, such as construction progress photographs of art-deco theaters and skyscrapers, as well as more documentary photographs that portray with a touching grace the lives of New Yorkers during the Great Depression. Browning's photographs depict the city in an era that began with a prosperous postwar economy, struggled through the Depression, and ended in the second World War; they document both the glamorous and the destitute environments that existed simultaneously in the city during this era.</p>
                    <p>Most photographs have been briefly labeled and bear one or more of several Irving Browning studio stamps; some photographs also have "Browning" and a negative number printed into the photograph. It is unclear which of the photographs may have been taken by Sam Browning or other photographers in Browning's employ; all credits refer to "Irving Browning" or the "Studio of Irving Browning." The majority of the photographs bear no dates. Approximate dates for buildings in this finding aid were researched during processing and are generally related to dates of building construction as established by the American Institute of Architects in the AIA Guide to New York City, 4th edition (New York: Three Rivers Press, 2000). Photographs in this collection bear only very brief descriptions on the verso or no description at all; descriptions listed in this finding aid were generally assigned or expanded by N-YHS staff and are not titles assigned by the Browning Studio.</p>
                    <p>The Advertising subseries primarily focuses on billboards and other large signs, many of which were taken around the Times Square area. Several of these advertising photographs also appear in Browning's photomontages.</p>
                    <p>Aircraft and Aeronautics includes mostly unidentified photographs of early aviators, airplanes, airships (blimps), and members of high society posing with aircraft at small airfields in the greater New York area. Included are portraits of several society women posing near airplanes; several of these were taken were at private aviation clubs such as the Aviation Country Club in on Long Island.

A large series of photographs focuses on a group of young, well-dressed, wealthy New Yorkers traveling on a cruise aboard the Queen of Bermuda. A few spectator scenes and swimming and diving or beach scenes depict participants across a broader economic spectrum.</p>
                    <p>Streets and Avenues consists of views of New York Streets in a variety of neighborhoods, from the signs and theaters of Broadway to shops along Fifth Avenue to the streets of Harlem. Streets and Avenue views are arranged into the follow subdivisions: Named Streets and Avenues, Numbered Avenues, and Numbered Streets; thereunder they are arranged alphabetically or numerically accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Television and Radio consists of photographs of microphones, equipment, studios and broadcasters from the early days of radio and television.</p>
                    <p>Theaters includes a few grand Broadway theaters of the era, but focuses heavily on the great movie palaces of the late 1920s and the 1930s, such as the Earl Carroll and the RKO Roxy Theatre. A heavy focus on interiors, and especially art-deco design elements, is evident. Also included are some views of burlesque and less legitimate venues, such as the Salon des Arts. Several theaters in this subseries were heavily documented by Browning, probably working on commission; some construction progress views are included.</p>
                    <p>Tourists consists of photographs of crowds looking through telescopes, gathered on the streets, and standing on viewing platforms.</p>
                    <p>Transportation contains a variety of views of public transportation in the New York area, including buses, elevated railroads, railroad stations, street railroads, and subway station entrances. Especially notable are Browning's photographs of Grand Central Terminal and McKim, Mead &amp; White's Pennsylvania Station.</p>
                    <p>Utilities consists of photographs of power lines, power plants, electric transformers, ash shoots, and gas tanks. Included are Consolidated Edison facilities, but most of the photographs in this series do not bear specific descriptions.</p>
                    <p>Winter Views depict a snow-covered Central Park framed by the towers of Fifth Avenue and Central Park South and West. They are mostly quiet, unpopulated landscapes; the few people in view are a man and child holding hands as they walk down a snowy path, a group of men gazing at the scenery from a horse-drawn carriage, and distant figures walking along a white-on-white horizon. Also included are a few night views that contrast the gleaming snow against a darkened sky.</p>
                    <p>Miscellaneous and Unidentified Views includes a traffic light, unidentified gravestones, unidentified landscapes and buildings, a man exhaling smoke profiled in a doorway, and some unidentified architectural details.</p>
                    <p>Two boxes at the end of the collection contain duplicate vintage prints of photographs from Series I which are being held in reserve.</p>

                    <p>Series II dates from consists of the contents of a scrapbook compiled by Irving Browning including ephemera and correspondence relating to Browning's career as a photographer and cinematographer. During processing, items were removed from acidic scrapbook pages, and the former page number was written on the verso of each item so that the original arrangement could be reconstructed if necessary. Materials are arranged alphabetically by format or genre, as described below.</p>
                    <p>Advertisements includes posters for events in which Irving Browning was involved, including an exhibition of his photographs at the First Annual Motion Picture and Costume Ball of the Film and Photo League on April 27th, 1934 and speaking engagements at DeWitt Clinton High School and the Film and Photo League.</p>
                    <p>Clippings includes items related to Irving Browning's exhibitions, a clipping of his published photograph of an elevated railroad, and a news photograph of Browning directing child actors in a film.</p>
                    <p>Correspondence includes several letters from Browning's colleague Lars Moën, regarding experiments with color film, a few letters regarding membership in professional societies such as the American Television Society and the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, as well as correspondence from the Film and Photo League, the manager of The Film Daily, Carl Louis Gregory, and S. Barret McCormick of RKO Radio Pictures. Also included is a correspondence from RKO Radio concerning details of construction and equipment for the RKO Roxy Theatre.</p>
                    <p>Identification Cards and Membership Cards are primarily from professional organizations and conferences in the 1940s and 1950s. These include several Universal Newsreel Field Cameraman identification cards (which include most of the few photographs of Irving Browning in this collection), union membership cards for the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators, a New York State drivers license from 1946, and other miscellaneous cards.</p>
                    <p>Pamphlets includes a Code of Ethics for the Society of Photographic Illustrators and an pamphlet about the New Film Alliance. Ribbons includes several exhibitor's ribbons from the Third Annual Exhibit of Professional Photography held in Rochester, New York.
