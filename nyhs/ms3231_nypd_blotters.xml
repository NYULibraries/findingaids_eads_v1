    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of 4 New York City Police Department blotters from 3 different police precincts in Manhattan dating from 1861 to 1899. One blotter is from the 1st Precinct, 2 are from the 2nd Precinct, and 1 is from the 25th Precinct.</p><p>
The blotters document the day to day workings of the police stations, including officer roll calls, changes in official duty rosters, police patrol post coverage and changes. They note the locations of open doors and windows, and any accidents or sudden deaths in the precinct. Entries detailing civil and criminal complaints include  the time of arrest, the name, race, age, place of birth, occupation, marital status, and ability to read and write of each offender, along with a list of their possessions at the time of arrest, and a brief description of the charges. Some indicate  the sentence as well. The blotters also include records of police surgeon's visits, "lodgers" (people seeking night shelter in the police station), and lost children.</p>  </scopecontent>
