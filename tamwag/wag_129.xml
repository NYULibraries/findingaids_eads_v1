            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>A native of New York City, James McNamara grew up in a working-class family. His father worked for the MTA as a motorman and was a member of the Transport Workers Union. Young McNamara attended Cooperstown Academy, in Cooperstown, New York, but was expelled from the Academy after organizing a student protest. McNamara worked at Yankee Stadium where he operated the turnstile to admit people into the stadium. He organized the vendors at the ball park into Local 153 of the Office, Professional Employees International Union, whereupon he was “promoted” and promptly fired. He graduated from James Monroe High School in the Bronx and then attended Brooklyn College and the City College of New York. His first position in the labor movement was as an unpaid organizer for Local 155 of the ILGWU. He subsequently went to work for the hatters union (The year was 1953 and hats were still in vogue). His first experience as a $50 per week organizer led to his once again being fired while trying to organize a shop in Hoboken, New Jersey. Moving across the river, he took up new duties for the hatters union in New York City.</p>
            <p>He later served in a variety of capacities for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, including International Representative, Director of Research and Education, Director of Organization; Manager of Local 102, Novelty Hat Workers Union; Administrator of the Local 3 Health Benefit Fund; and Trustee of the Local 80 Health Benefit and Retirement Funds. His responsibilities included organizing and servicing new locals in sixteen states and Puerto Rico, negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, and the drafting and implementation of contracts. In 1966 McNamara left union work to begin his second career as a civil servant.</p>
            <p>Mayor John Lindsay recruited McNamara to work in his new administration as the Director of Community Relations for Labor and Industry in the Human Resources Department. In March 1968 McNamara took up new duties as Special Assistant to the Commissioner of Model Cities in the Human Resources Department (MCDA/HRA). In this capacity, he represented the Mayor’s office in negotiations with the building trades (unions and employers associations), community groups and city agencies in launching pilot projects in Model Cities areas. In July 1970, McNamara took on the position of Director of the Building Trades Training Department in New York City’s Manpower and Career Development Agency, part of the Human Resources Administration (HRA, now the Department of Employment). He conceived and implemented Mayor’s Executive Order #20, which required on-the-job training of minority workers in all city-assisted construction.</p>
            <p>In October 1973 McNamara took up the position of Director of the Office of Contract Compliance, and Deputy Director of the Bureau of Labor Services, Office of the Mayor, New York City. Here he was instrumental in creating and expanding the new office of C.C./Construction, and in developing rules, regulations, and contract language for New York City’s affirmative action programs. In March 1977 he became the Assistant Commissioner of the New York State Division of Human Rights. Here he supervised the implementation of the Governor’s Executive Orders on Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action, as well as serving as the Director of the Office of State Contract Compliance Programs (E.O.45) and Affirmative Action in State Agencies (E.O. 40). He supervised the administration of state contracts with the Recruitment and Training Program, Inc., for minority recruitment in the building trades.</p>
            <p>From September 1981 to January 1983, McNamara served as the Director of the Mayor’s Office of Construction Industry Relations. Reporting directly to the Mayor, he coordinated the City’s activities in combating employment discrimination and extortion in the construction industry. In February 1983, he became a consultant to the New York State Commission of Investigation in connection with a study of the building trades and construction industry practices. He served as an expert witness in public hearings which were conducted as part of the investigation.</p>
            <p>In October 1985 he was assigned to the New York State Organized Crime Task Force by the Mayor’s Office and the Commissioner of Investigation to assist in an investigation of the New York building trades and construction industry. In April of 1990 he was assigned to the construction industry project of the New York City Commission of Human Rights and the New York City Office of Labor Services. The investigation focused on race and gender discrimination, and McNamara carried out research in preparation for the public hearings.</p>
            <p>In March 1993 McNamara became a consultant to the District Attorney’s Office, County of New York, in the Labor Racketeering Unit. Again, he performed research for investigations of labor racketeering in the construction industry. In 1992 James McNamara retired after a twenty-five year career. In addition to his official duties, McNamara has been active in numerous organizations. He serves on the boards of the Workers Defense League and the Association for Union Democracy. He also serves as the Research Director for the AUD. He is the Secretary and Member of the Board of Directors of the Sixth Avenue Credit Union, Past President of the Gouverneur Gardens Housing Cooperative, a former member and Treasurer of the Board of Directors, Lower Eastside Neighborhood Association, the former Vice Chairman of Local School Board #3 and the Chairman of the Site Selection and Construction Committee.</p>
            <p>He has served as an expert witness in numerous cases involving discrimination and corruption in the building trades and construction industry. He has been at the center of the major struggles for the last quarter century in New York City involving the effort to open up the building trades unions to minority workers and to women, along with the repeated efforts of government agencies to clean up corruption in the industry. His wife, Ann Cadmus McNamara, an attorney, was General Counsel, New York City Department of Employment.</p>

            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I: United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, 1970-1999</emph>, includes materials from investigations into corruption in New York City’s District Council of Carpenters dating back to DC President Ted Maritas. This includes the indictment and related cases. Maritas disappeared and his body was never found. However, his wallet and car were found alongside the East River. The trail of corruption and records of litigation continue through the successive government cases against DC President Paschal McGuinness, who resigned from his office and was barred from seeking union office in NYC (He currently holds an executive position within the International Brotherhood of Carpenters); and Fred Devine (found guilty on racketeering charges; case on appeal). Materials include indictments, memoranda; correspondence; transcripts of hearings, and reports of the Independent Review Officer (I.R.O.) charged with oversight in the District Council. Other noteworthy documents in the series include the transcripts of the hearings on corruption at the Jacob Javits Center (Fiorino); the indictment and related records related to the shooting of Carpenters’ official John O’Connor; and the repeated efforts of outspoken members to secure their rights within the union (Macaluso; Clarke; Local 608 hiring hall case). Additional examples of graft and corruption can be found in the records of (former) Bronx Local 17 (Shepis; Moscatiello).</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series II: Mason Tenders Local of the Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA), 1985-1996</emph>, is comprised of records pertaining to racketeering in the Mason Tenders Local of the Laborers International Union of North America (LIUNA), New York City. They document legal actions connected to the Consent Decree entered into by the union in 1994. The outstanding example of testimony related to the case is that of Sammy “the Bull” Gravano, the most famous (and most productive) mobster to testify for the government. Records related to Lou Moscatiello and the declaration of Attorney Roger Levin provide examples of the systemic nature of corruption in the industry.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series III: International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades, District Council 9, 1967-1995</emph>, contains records relating to the long history of corruption and mob control of the International Brotherhood of Painters, District Council 9 in New York City. Repeated efforts to clean up the union have met with failure. The records include correspondence, transcripts of wire taps; indictments; briefs and trial transcripts, along with additional material from active union members related to the internal life of the union (elections; opposition newspapers, flyers, etc.). Press clippings detail the history of mob control and racketeering. Records related to Lou Moscatiello, Bronx mobster, are also included in this series.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series IV: United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry, Plumbers Local #2 (Manhattan), 1964-1997</emph>, contains records related to the government investigation and trial against the officials of Plumbers union, Local #2, Manhattan. After an early morning raid on the offices and homes of top officials, most were tried, convicted and went to jail. The records include press clippings, progress reports, and Department of Labor reports on finances (LM-2s) and the trusteeship (LM-15s). The legal records and briefs document the pattern of corruption in the industry, as does the report “Enforcement Down the Drain.” An important chapter of internal union activity is found in the materials related to the 1996 election in Local 2. The unusually high degree of membership participation and the government efforts to clean up the local were undone when the International merged the local out of existence; members of Local #2 now found themselves in Local #1 (Ozone Park, Queens).</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series V: Service Employees International Union, Local 32 B-J, 1954-1999</emph>, includes records that document a rank-and-file campaign within the 32B-J to challenge the corruption of local union officials. The efforts of the reformers led to the ouster of Gus Bevona as president of 32B-J. Bevona had the distinction of being the highest paid union leader in the country (see LM-2s). He was removed by his international president, Andrew Stern, after the reformers succeeded in raising repeated challenges through a variety of campaigns centered on by-law reforms. The corruption within officialdom was given additional exposure with the conviction of business agent McGorman for selling jobs to members. The reformers’ campaign to provide background information to the sentencing judge is documented in the collection.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VI: International Brotherhood of Teamsters, 1968-1998</emph>, consists of records documenting various phases of corruption as well as rank-and-file opposition activity in New York area Teamsters locals. Included are files on Local 807 (the Javits Center local), Tony Salerno and Local 272 (the parking garage local), the government’s case against Barry Feinstein of Local 237, the report issued by the Independent Review Officer on Teamster leader Ron Carey, and Susan Jennik’s brief for the Association for Union Democracy (submitted in relation to U.S. v. IBT, the so-called “Cosa Nostra” case).</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VII: Building Trades Employers’ Association, 1945-1997</emph>, includes materials related to the Association concerning jurisdictional disputes between the building trades.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VIII: Unprocessed Material, 1990s-2000s</emph>, consists of four boxes of recently donated material, including files on the investigation of Brian McLaughlin as president of the New York City Central Labor Council.</p>
