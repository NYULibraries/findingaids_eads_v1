            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Protestant missionary Reverend Alfredo Barone (1869-1950) and his wife, Rosina (d. 1956), emigrated from Calitri, Italy in 1899 with three of their eventual eleven children and settled in New England. Their remaining children were born in Connecticut and Massachusetts. In 1920, the Barones lived in Stamford, Connecticut and Alfredo served as pastor of a Baptist church. By 1930, the family had moved and was residing in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn at 589 E. 51 Street. All of the children who survived infancy lived some part of their lives in Brooklyn.</p>
            <p>One of Alfredo and Rosina's children, Melchisedech Alfred Barone (1892-1961) was a physician who attended Columbia University from 1916-1918 and earned his B.S. and medical degrees there. His younger sister, Rebecca Rowena Barone (d. 1984), graduated from Hunter College in 1934, received a library science degree from Pratt Institute in 1941 and eventually made a career as a librarian. In 1925, Dr. Barone lived with his wife (Anna Giulio) and their three children (Victoria, Alfred, and Myron) at 208 Prospect Avenue in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>
            <p>Melchisedech and Anna's oldest son, Alfred Dernier Barone (1922-2006), graduated from PS 10 in 1937, Manual Training High School in 1941 and attended New York University prior to being drafted into the U.S. Army during World War II. While stationed in San Francisco, California, he met his eventual wife, Shirley Lawson (d. 1978). He served in the 11th Airborne Division in the Philippines, Okinawa, and Japan. Following the war, Alfred worked for Allied Bendix Aerospace.</p>

                    <p>The series contains 485 photographs dating from circa 1913 to 1963. The series is almost exclusively black-and-white photographic prints, but also includes several color photographic prints and a small number of photographic negatives. The photographs mostly consist of snapshots of members of the Barone family and friends in largely unidentified locations and show children and adults primarily outdoors and at leisure. The early childhood of siblings Alfred D. Barone, Victoria Barone, and Myron Barone is particularly well represented. Approximately 20 of the photographs are studio portraits, the subjects of which include Melchisedech Alfred Barone, Alfred D. Barone, and Victoria Barone, among others. The series also contains several class photographs, including a wide format photograph of a class at Erasmus Hall High School (1931). Photographs of Alfred D. Barone and Melvin Barone in military uniform and an outdoor group portrait of the 2nd Platoon CO "H" 1st Signal Training Regiment taken at Camp Edison in New Jersey in 1943 are also present. Some of the photographs are dated and identified on the verso and locations include the Coney Island neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, California, Wyoming, and Washington, D.C.</p>
