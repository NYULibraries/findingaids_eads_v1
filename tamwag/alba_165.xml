      <abstract id="aspace_76959bfc74e93af4ef1005624598d7e6">Irving Weissman (1913-1998) was a labor
        activist and a member of the Young Communist League before he went to fight in the Spanish
        Civil War. In Spain he trained and fought with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion. Weissman
        also fought with the United States Army in World War II. Weissman’s work as an organizer for
        the Communist Party in the late 1940s led him to be charged and tried under the Smith Act
        for conspiring to advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government; the charges were eventually
        dismissed. Later in life, Weissman was an active member of the Veterans of the Abraham
        Lincoln Brigade (VALB) and was editor of their newsletter, <title render="italic">The
          Volunteer</title>, for several years. This collection includes correspondence written by
        Weissman while in Spain and documents related to his participation in the Spanish Civil War
        and World War II. It also contains extensive subject files related to VALB activities,
        especially in the 1970s and 1980s, and to Weissman's writings</abstract>

      <p>One box of the Irving Weissman Papers was donated by Irving Weissman to the Abraham Lincoln
        Brigade Archives, then held at Brandeis University, in 1994. This material was transferred
        to the Tamiment Library, with the original acquisition of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade
        Archives collections in January 2001. At that time a small Tamiment collection of Weissman
        material (Tam #226), comprised of itmes apparently donated by Weissman himself and material
        donated by Bolerium Books in 2000, was merged with the ALBA collection. In July of 2005,
        draft chapters of an autobiographical novel and other notes and manuscirpt fragments were
        donated by Robert Snyder and added to the collection. The accession NPA 2000.288 was added
        to this collection in 2015.</p>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Irving Weissman (1913-1998) grew up in a Polish-Jewish immigrant family in New York City.
        In the early 1930s Weissman attended City College of New York for one year studying English
        literature and history. He quit school to work in a factory and help support his family.
        Weissman was a member of the Young Communist League and was active in the Fur and Leather
        Workers and the United Electrical Workers Unions. He participated in actions of unemployed
        and laid-off workers during the Depression. Weissman eventually got a Works Progress
        Administration (WPA) job teaching English to recent immigrants. He left this job to go to
        fight in the Spanish Civil War in 1937.</p>
      <p>Weissman departed for Spain on the <emph render="italic">SS American Importer</emph>on May
        8, 1937. In Spain, he trained with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion and went into action
        with that Battalion on the Aragon front and at Fuentes de Ebro in September and October
        1937. Weissman fell ill at the end of October and was sent to Barcelona with a delegation of
        the 15th International Brigade where he performed guard duties while he recovered. He
        rejoined the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion in December 1937. Weissman left Spain on December
        15, 1938.</p>
      <p>Upon his return to the United States Weissman worked as a ship's fitter in Hoboken, New
        Jersey. He was a member of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of
        America, Local 15 and was elected to the Union's grievance committee. Weissman served in the
        United States Army from 1942 to 1945. During World War II he fought in campaigns in North
        Africa, Italy, France, Belgium, and Germany. When he returned to the United States he
        accepted an assignment from the Communist Party--of which he was then a member--to be an
        organizer, first in western New York State, then in West Virginia.</p>
      <p>In 1951 Weissman was arrested along with five other veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade
        and Communist Party members and charged, under the Smith Act, with conspiring to advocate
        the overthrow of the United States government. Weissman was sentenced to five years in
        prison but the case was appealed. In 1956 the Supreme Court ruled that the case be retried
        and the new prosecutor's motion to dismiss the case was granted. In the intervening years
        Weissman had spent several months in jail while bail was raised and had served time for
        contempt of court for refusing to give names of Communist Party members on the witness
        stand. In the late 1950s Weissman left the Communist Party.</p>
      <p>Weissman worked in building construction in New York from 1953 until his retirement in
        1978. Throughout this time and for the rest of his life he was active in neighborhood
        politics and with the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). Weissman headed a
        campaign to secure pension rights for Polish-Jewish veterans of the Botwin Company, some of
        whom were charging the Polish authorities with anti-Semitism. He was also editor of <title
          render="italic">The Volunteer</title>for several years during the 1980s. When his wife
        Freda died in the early 1990s Weissman moved from New York to San Francisco to be near his
        daughters and grandchildren. He remained active with VALB on the west coast, helping to
        raise funds for a monument in Seattle. Irving Weissman died of congestive heart failure on
        December 20, 1998.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>Series I, Spanish Civil War and World War II Era, 1937-1946. The bulk of this series
        consists of correspondence written by Irving Weissman to his sister Sara and his parents
        from Spain between May 1937 and October 1938. Two letters are written in Yiddish, using the
        Roman alphabet. Weissman wrote long, detailed letters about his journey to Spain, the
        landscape, his training, life in the barracks, and his experiences on the fronts. The
        economic hardships that his family was facing at home in the United States are discussed as
        well as his parents' worries for their son's safety. Weissman's letters provide evidence of
        his political convictions as well as how his point of view evolved as a result of
        experiencing war first hand. As well as writing to his family, Weissman wrote to friends and
        political comrades and he maintained contact with an imprisoned Spanish comrade, Jose
        Ferando Ventura, after returning to the United States. This series contains documents
        related to the Spanish Civil War and to Weissman's service in the United States Army during
        World War II, most notably, a diary he kept while serving in Europe. The series also
        contains union cards and documents that reveal some of Weissman's activities and areas of
        employment in the years between the two wars.</p>
      <p>Series II, Subject Files, 1951-1996 (bulk 1977-1996). This series consists of
        correspondence, essays and articles, and other documents related to Weissman's activities
        with the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) and his position as editor of their
        newsletter, The Volunteer. Correspondence in this series is mostly incoming and third party
        correspondence sent or forwarded to Weissman by other VALB members. VALB members represented
        in this collection include Theodore (Ted) Cogswell, Carl Geiser, Ben Iceland, Edward
        Lending, Abe Osheroff, Abe Smorodin, Morris Stamm, and Robert Steck. The series contains
        letters and writings by these and other veterans. This series also contains records relating
        to VALB activities, particularly those in New York but also regional and national efforts.
        Included in the VALB files are a copy of the VALB and American Medical Bureau Names List
        compiled by Ted Cogswell, records related to some of the organization's bureaus and
        commissions, and documents on VALB's campaign to send aid to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
        Weissman's work on behalf of Polish-Jewish Spanish Civil War veterans is well documented in
        this series. Finally, the series contains essays, articles, and book reviews written by
        Weissman.</p>

            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials that have not been digitized
              (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must request an access copy. Researchers
              may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for
              playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been
              digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our
              reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before
              they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of
              your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy,
              or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact
