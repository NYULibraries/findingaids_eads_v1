                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Daily World</emph> Cartoon Collection contains a wide range of cartoons and sketches published and submitted for publication to the official organ of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker </emph>(and its various later forms). The 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker's</emph> editorial positions reflected the policies of the CPUSA. The paper also attempted to speak to the broad left-wing community in the United States that included labor, civil rights, and peace activists, with stories covering a wide range of events, organizations and individuals in the United States and around the world. As a daily newspaper, it covered the major stories of the twentieth century. However, the paper always placed an emphasis on radical social movements, social and economic conditions particularly in working class and minority communities, poverty, labor struggles, racial discrimination, right wing extremism with an emphasis on fascist and Nazi movements, and of course the Soviet Union and the world-wide Communist movement. The paper has had a succession of names and has been published in varying frequences between daily to weekly over the course of its existence. In 2010 it ceased print publication and became an electronic, online-only, weekly publication titled the 
                <emph render="italic">People's World</emph>. A number of different artists are represented in the collection, including: Fred Ellis, Eric (James Erickson), Hugo Gellert, Norman Goldberg, Ollie Harrington, Hal Kinkaid, Robert Minor, and Joseph Seymour, among numerous others. A large portion of the cartoons in the collection are original, signed drawings, but also present are newsprint copies and pre-press prints. The material in the collection ranges in date from the late 1920s up through the 2002, though is predominantly from the 1940s-1980s. The topics covered by the cartoons are as diverse as was the coverage of the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker.</emph> Focusing heavily on capitalism, civil rights, civil liberties, labor, and the Vietnam War, as well as caricatures of Presidents and other influential politicians, the cartoons provide a narrative for the major events of the 20th century, particularly those that effected the left-wing community in the US.</abstract>

            <p>The collection is arranged in four series: I: Biographical Cartoons; II: Subject Cartoons; III: Cartoons by Artist; IV: Ephemera and other Graphics.</p>
            <p>All series are arranged first alphabetically and then chronologically. Due to space constraints, physical arrangement of materials does not match intellectual arrangement.</p>

            <p>The 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker </emph>and 
                <emph render="italic">Daily World</emph> Cartoon Collection consists of original and copied cartoons and sketches produced for the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker/Daily World</emph> and its later incarnations. There is a small amount of non-cartoon graphics and ephemera in the collection. The material ranges in date from 1928-2002, but is largely from the 1940s-1980s. The Collection is arranged into four series, the first two of which were pulled from the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Daily World </emph>Photograph Collection (PHOTOS 223). Like that Collection, here there is a Biographical Series, which includes cartoons depicting individuals, and a Subject Series. The cartoons in these two series are as diverse as the topics covered by the newspaper, including in the Biographical Series prominent radical and progressive leaders, as well as US Presidents, labor leaders, and cultural figures. The subjects, too, are diverse and cover not only major issues facing communists such as capitalism and labor, civil liberties, McCarthyism and witch hunts, and struggles for peace but also a wide range of everyday images as well, such as beaches, children, education, and holidays.</p>
            <p>Included in the Collection are cartoons, both original and copies, from several prominent artists. These include: Fred Ellis, Eric (James Erickson), Norman Goldberg, Ollie Harrington, Hal Kincaid, Robert Minor, among dozens more. There are enough cartoons by each artist, that his/her general but unique style is conveyed. Of particular note are the hundreds of original sketches and drawings from Fred Ellis as well as scrapbooks of his printed cartoons. There is a small sketchbook from Robert Minor, a signature from Hugo Gellert, and a signed sketch from Pete Seeger.</p>

            <p>The 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker</emph>, the official organ of the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), traces its origins back to the Communist Labor Party, founded in Chicago in 1919. The Communist Labor Party’s paper was known as the 
                <emph render="italic">Toiler</emph>. When the Communist Labor Party and the Workers Party merged in 1921, the 
                <emph render="italic">Toiler</emph> became the weekly paper 
                <emph render="italic">The Worker</emph>. Two years later, the paper changed its name to the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker</emph>. As a daily newspaper, the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker</emph> covered the major stories of the 20th century, while at the same time speaking to the left-wing sector of the American population, which included labor, civil rights, and peace activists. The newspaper emphasized radical social movements, labor struggles, racial discrimination, right wing extremism, the Soviet Union, and the world-wide Communist movement.</p>
            <p>The CPUSA grew under increasing attack following WWII. The rise of McCarthyism and the Red Scare eventually forced the Party to go underground, and in 1958, the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker</emph> shut down operation. In 1960, it resumed bi-weekly publication as 
                <emph render="italic">The Worker</emph>, but never achieved the level of popularity it had in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
            <p>In 1967, the paper now known as the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily World</emph>, again became a daily. It reported on the civil rights movement, including sit-ins, voter registration campaigns and the Freedom Rides. In the late 1960s and into the early 1970s, the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily World</emph> aligned itself with the anti-Vietnam War and black nationalist movements.</p>
            <p>In 1986 the paper merged with the CPUSA's West Coast weekly, the 
                <emph render="italic">People's World</emph>. The newly formed 
                <emph render="italic">People's Daily World</emph> was published from 1987 until 1991, when daily publication was abandoned in favor of a weekly edition, renamed the 
                <emph render="italic">People's Weekly World</emph>. During this period the paper focused heavily on labor union activity, particularly in cities like Detroit and Chicago, as well as the growing anti-globalization movement.</p>
            <p>Shifting its operations back to Chicago between 2001 and 2002, the paper changed its name to the 
                <emph render="italic">People's World</emph> in 2009. In 2010, the paper ceased print publication and became an electronic, online-only, publication.</p>
            <p>Specific artists represented in the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker/ Daily World</emph> Cartoon Collection include: Fred Ellis, Ollie Harrington, Hugo Gellert, Norman Goldberg, Kinkaid, and James Erickson (Eric), among numerous others.</p>

            <p>Cartoons were put into new acid-free folders and boxes. Acid-free Interleaving was used to separate original drawings.</p>

                    <p>Series I: Biographical Cartoons consists of cartoons depicting individuals. The cartoons were pulled from the 
                        <emph render="italic">Daily Worker</emph> and 
                        <emph render="italic">Daily World</emph> Photograph Collection (PHOTOS 223). The folder titles that the cartoons came out of were retained in this series. The material ranges in date from 1936-1994, but for the most part is undated. This series consists of original and pre-press drawings. Roughly half the folders contain signed artwork. Artists that have considerable representation in this series include: Eric (James Erickson), Hayle, Sam Hill, Hal Kinkaid, and Snow (Haile Hendrix). Individuals represented in the cartoons are diverse and range from US Presidents, Eisenhower, Johnson, Nixon, and Roosevelt to Communist Party USA leaders Benjamin Davis, Gil Green, and Gus Hall. Additionally, prominent cultural figures can also be found in this series as well as international political leaders. The people in the biographical series are as diverse as the

                    <p>Series II: Subject Cartoons consists of cartoons filed by hundreds of different subjects. This series is divided into two subseries, the first of which contains cartoons that were pulled from the 
                        <emph render="italic">Daily Worker</emph> and 
                        <emph render="italic">Daily World</emph> Photograph Collection (PHOTOS 223). The folder titles that the cartoons came out of were retained in this sub-series. The material ranges in date from 1937-1988, but for the most part is undated. The second subseries contains another set of cartoons arranged by subject. These presumably were used as a cartoon and graphic filing system for the 
                        <emph render="italic">Daily Worker/Daily World</emph>.</p>

                        <p>Fred Ellis was a staff artist for the 
                            <emph render="italic">Daily Worker/Daily world</emph>/ He has hundreds of original cartoons and sketches in this subseries. Most of the cartoons and sketches are undated, however likely it dates from the 1940s and 1950s. Each original drawing or sketch is usually produced with a waxy crayon on paper. Also by Fred Ellis are a number of scrapbooks of his works as reproduced in the 
                            <emph render="italic">Daily Worker/Daily World</emph>. The scrapbooks range in date from 1936-1941. Ellis' work covers a dynamic range of subjects often portraying the plight of labor against big business as depicted by two central figures, a large "Big Business" man in suit and tie and a burly laborer, usually in overalls or with a miner's hat. The sketches here trace the major events of the time, including presidential elections, McCarthyism, and fights for civil liberties.</p>
