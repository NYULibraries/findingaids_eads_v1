    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Albert Gallatin (1761-1849) was born in Geneva, Switzerland and emigrated to the United States as a youth, where he quickly became involved in American politics. As a House of Representatives member he was the leader of the Democratic-Republican Party and served as Secretary of the Treasury from 1801 to 1813. Following his career as a politician and diplomat, Gallatin helped found New York University in 1831. The Gallatin School of Individualized Study is named in honor of his contributions to the University. </p><p>Henry Day Lanier is a great-great-great grandson of Albert Gallatin and a community development finance consultant at Forsyth Street Advisors. He is an investment banker in the public finance sector and has been a board member and director of multiple organizations related to public finance.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Framed items were unframed, and copies of documents held at other repositories have been offered back to the family. Before accessioning, the University Archivist foldered the materials received and labeled the folders based on the donor-provided inventory (which is appended to the donor agreement). Not every collection item could be connected to the inventory. </p><p>At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused in acid-free folders and archival boxes, and oversize materials were unfolded and placed in oversize boxes.</p>  </processinfo>
