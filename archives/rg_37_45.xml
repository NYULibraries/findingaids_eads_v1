<p>New York University's Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Policitics is an interdisciplinary institute whose mission is to "connect artists, scholars, and activists from across the Americas and create new avenues for collaboration and action." The institute focuses on political engagement and social justice through events, conferences, large-scale international gatherings, performances, other artistic works, and publications. The Hemispheric Institute was founded in 1998 by Diana Taylor, and has grown into an international network of universities and cultural centers across the Americas that collaborate on projects and individual actions concerning human rights and social justice.</p>  </bioghist>

In July 2019, an accretion of exhibition materials created for the institute's 2018 gala was donated, and incorporated into the collection as a separate series.
