            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Gil Green (1906-1997) was a Communist, a Smith Act defendant, and a prominent figure in the CPUSA through 1991. As a youth, he joined the Young Workers League (later the Young Communist League) eventually becoming its national secretary. From 1941-1945 and again from 1966-1968, Green was head of the Party in New York State and also briefly headed Illinois' Party organization. Convicted under the Smith Act in 1949, Green was impirsoned from 1956 until 1961. He left the Party in 1991 and founded the Committees of Correspondence. These papers include his correspondence, writings, documentation of his political activities, and FBI files regarding their investigation of him.

            <p>Gil Green (1906-1997), born Gilbert Greenberg in Chicago, the son of working class Russian-Jewish immigrants, was a Communist youth leader in the 1930s, a member of the Communist Party's Politburo, a Smith Act defendant, and the chief (albeit unofficial) figure of a reformist current in the CPUSA through 1991. Although high school valedictorian he did not go to college. Instead he joined the Young Workers League (later the Young Communist League) in 1924, and shortly thereafter, the CPUSA. He rose through the ranks, and in 1932 became national secretary of the YCL, a position he held throughout the decade, where he trained a generation of Party cadres and led the League to a position of influence in the 1.7 million member American Youth Congress. In 1935 he attended the Comintern's Seventh Congress, where he was an advocate for the emerging Popular Front policy. In 1941 Green became head of the Party in New York State, but had to relinquish this title in 1945 due to his association with Earl Browder, the ousted Party head, and moved to Illinois, where he headed that state's Party organization. Convicted under the Smith Act in 1949, Green became a fugitive, surrendered in 1956 and was released from jail in 1961. By 1966, Green was again head of the New York Party, but resigned this position in 1968 to protest the CPUSA's endorsement of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. He remained an elder statesman and locus of CP reform currents until 1991, when he left the Party and helped to found the Committees of Correspondence, a social-democratic organization.

            <p>The General Correspondence (most incoming, arranged alphabetically) is primarily with like-minded communists, ex-communists, other U.S. leftists, historians and other researchers, and is primarily concerned with communist history and with current events, radical thought and activity. There is also some family correspondence. Prominent and/or principal correspondents include: Harry Bridges, Lloyd Brown, David Engelstein, Sender Garlin, Dorothy Healey, Kate Hyndman, Lolita Lebron and other Puerto Rican radicals, Sidney Lens, Helen North (his second wife), Paul Robeson Jr., Bill Schneiderman, Pat Toohey, Saul Wellman and Leon Wofsy. The Addendum to this series consists of additional correspondence with David Englestein and Sender Garlin. The Prison Correspondence, arranged chronologically, consists of copies of (mostly outgoing) letters, most to his first wife (Lil Green, 1910-1964) and children, some to political associates and attorneys. The Political Activities, Associates and Writings series contains unpublished typescripts by Green and others, notably James Allen's memoir

                <title render="italic">A Labor Revolutionary in Detroit</title>(re Nat Ganley), and Green's 1968 notes on his remarks on Czechoslovakia at the CP's Central Committee meeting thereon; editorial files pertaining to the writing, publication and reception of several of Green's later books, notably his autobiographical 
                <title render="italic">Cold War Fugitive</title>(1984); third party correspondence of several of Green's political friends and associates, notably Lloyd Brown; and a file of Smith Act-related material obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The last series, FBI Files, were also obtained by Green under the FOIA.
