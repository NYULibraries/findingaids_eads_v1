    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Malcolm Goldstein is a composer and violinist primarily concerned with structured improvisation and a unique style which he calls "soundings." He writes graphic scores which combine elements of standard musical notation, calligraphy, written instructions, and collage. Goldstein has collaborated with many dancers, writers, and musicians, most frequently with Philip Corner and Allison Knowles.</p><p>Born on March 27, 1936 in Brooklyn NY, Malcolm Goldstein attended Columbia University from 1952 through 1959 where he studied with Otto Leuning and Antonio Miranda. In 1962 he began performing with the Judson Dance Theater, shortly followed by participation in the NY Festival of the Avant Garde and the Experimental Intermedia Foundation. In 1963 he co-founded the Tone Roads chamber ensemble with Philip Corner and James Tenney. Tone Roads, which takes its name from a mid-career composition by Charles Ives, showcased works by Ives, Ruggles, Cage, and Varese. Goldstein went on to work on a critical edition of Ives' work. He also wrote extensively about these musicians as well as about improvisation. He is the author of the book <emph render="italic">Sounding the Full Circle</emph> distributed by Frog Peak Music. He has traveled extensively, performing in countries around the world, and has received many awards including the Prix Acustica International by WDR. </p><p>Goldstein has held teaching positions at Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center (1959-1960), Columbia College (1961-1965), the New School for Social Research (1963-1965, 1967-1969), the New England Conservatory (1965-1967), Dickinson College (1969-1971), Goddard College (1972-1974), and Bowdoin College (1978-1982). Goldstein has curated and performed in many concerts at these institutions as well as in festivals around the world.</p><p>Sources: </p><p>The Living Composers Project, http://www.composers21.com/compdocs/goldsteinm.htm</p><p>Grove Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/47511</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The Malcolm Goldstein Papers are arranged at the folder level and titles reflect Goldstein's original labeling taken from envelopes. Material was originally labeled with several layers of descriptive information. For this reason all envelopes were saved (see Series IX) and can be viewed alongside the material they originally housed. When applicable, additional information was represented as a 'Scope and Content Note' for each individual item. Any titles created by the archivist have been placed in square brackets and have been added minimally.</p><p>
In 2018, material was removed from their envelopes and foldered, keeping the envelopes with notations. File titles were taken from the envelopes. The files were updated or incorporated into existing series I.A., II.B., III.C., and V.A. 
The scope and content note for II.C. was updated. The original arrangement note was updated, removing information and creating a processing note.</p><p>In 2019, material was removed from envelopes, foldered, and placed in a box. Folder titles were taken from the envelopes. The files were updated or incorporated into existing Series I.A, OVERSIZE Series I.A, Series II.A, Series III.C, and Series IX. </p><p>In 2020 and 2023, accretions were rehoused and intellectually integrated into the collection's existing series structure. One audio optical disc was forensically imaged, analyzed, and described; the two commercial optical discs of the collection were identified but not imaged, and were intellectually incorporated into Series V.A. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.  </p>  </processinfo>
