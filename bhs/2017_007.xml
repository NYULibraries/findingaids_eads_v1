    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Maybelle L. Mann was born in Richmond, Virginia on December 5, 1909. Her parents, Andrew J. Mann and Zenobia M. (Morris) Mann, moved the family to Brooklyn sometime before 1920. They resided at 349A Quincy Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, where Mann would remain for the rest of her life. Mann had two sisters, Zenobia and Ora. A younger cousin, Tasso, also resided with the family for a time. Her father left the home by 1933, and he died in 1945. Her mother died in 1966. Mann graduated from Columbia University in the 1930s and was employed as a school teacher. She was also a longtime member of St. Ann's and the Holy Trinity Church. She died in her home in 1998 and is buried in Evergreen Cemetery.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The papers and photographs document the life of Maybelle L. Mann and her family in the Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn from 1919 to 1999. The photographs (including one photograph album as well as loose prints and negatives) depict the African American family's life in Brooklyn, their outdoor recreational activities, as well as their friends and classmates. The photographs also include portraits and family members posing in front of their home (349A Quincy Street) and the City Park branch of the Brooklyn Public Library (in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn). The papers consist of incoming correspondence with a friend in Italy, Christmas Cards, a travel diary, and some teaching materials. The materials also include one Super-8 film reel which labeled "Christmas 1950".</p>  </scopecontent>
