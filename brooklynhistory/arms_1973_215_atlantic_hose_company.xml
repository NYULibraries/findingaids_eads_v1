            <p>The Atlantic Hose Company No. 1 manuscript consists of a four-page typewritten pages spanning the dates 1835 to 1881. The manuscript collects reminisciences of past members of the company, recorded by an unnamed reporter of the 
                <emph render="italic">New York World</emph> at a meeting of the Society of Old Brooklynites in 1881. The manuscript was typed by Henry M. Nicholson, son of Joshua Clibborn Nicholson, who was a member of the company from 1865 to 1870. It is not clear whether Henry M. Nicholson was the reporter who wrote the story, or if he simply transcribed it.</p>

            <p>The Atlantic Hose Company No. 1 was organized as the Atlantic Hose and Relief Company on November 27, 1835 at a meeting in a vacant store located at 132 Fulton Street in Brooklyn, New York. The company, part of Brooklyn's Volunteer Fire Department, was made up of merchants, lawyers, financiers and other professionals. Its first headquarters was a shed on High Street, and in 1836 it moved to Firemen's Hall on Poplar Street until 1851 when it moved to the new Firemen's Hall on Henry Street. That same year the company renamed itself the Atlantic Hose Company No. 1 and remained active until 1869, when Brooklyn's first paid professional Fire Department went into operation and the Volunteer Fire Department was disbanded.</p>
