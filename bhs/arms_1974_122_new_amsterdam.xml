    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>This item had been stored folded in a manuscript box and its seal was wrapped in old and stained fabric that did not seem to be related or have any significance. In August 2023, the item was rehoused flat in an oversize folder, with the seal in a foam mount, and the fabric discarded. After rehousing, the finding aid was revised, including changing the title from "New Amsterdam land grant" to "Colonial New York land grant" to more accurately reflect the document's contents and date.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Dutch colony of New Amsterdam was founded in the mid-1620s and was located at the southern tip of Manhattan. In 1664, the British took over the colony and renamed it New York. It was briefly regained by the Dutch in 1673, but returned to English rule in 1674 and remained so until 1783. This land grant regarding property in the colony was written in 1718 when George I was King.</p>  </bioghist>
