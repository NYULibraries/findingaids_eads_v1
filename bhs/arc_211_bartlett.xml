    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Willard Bartlett (1846-1925) was born in Massachusetts and lived in Brooklyn for the latter 56 years of his life.  He graduated from New York University in 1868, and in 1870 he wed Mary Fairbanks Buffum of Brooklyn, with whom he had two daughters, Maud W. and Agnes W. Bartlett.  Bartlett practiced law with Elihu Root from 1869 to 1883, and in 1884 became a Justice of the Supreme Court of New York State. He went on to serve as an Appellate Division Justice in the Supreme Court, an Associate Justice of the New York State Court of Appeals, and finally Chief Justice of the New York State Court of Appeals.  In 1917, he retured to practicing law with Elihu Root.  Bartlett was President of the New England Society in the City of Brooklyn and the Long Island Historical Society (now the Brooklyn Historical Society), a member of the American Bar Association and the Brooklyn Bar Association, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  He also served as a drama critic for the <emph render="italic">New York Sun</emph> and reviewed books for the <emph render="italic">New York Herald</emph>.  Bartlett also taught medical jurisprudence as a professor at the Long Island College Hospital.  At Willard Bartlett's death, the Bartlett family resided at 21 Pierrepont Street in Brooklyn.</p>  </bioghist>
