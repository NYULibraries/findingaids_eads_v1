    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection contains prints and negatives of the St. Teresa's Girls School, Auditorium, and Convent. The prints contain pictures of both the outside and the inside of the auditorium and convent, and the outside and inside (mainly stairwells and lighting) of the school. The negatives contain the same. The collection also contains Historic American Buildings Surveys (HABS) for the auditorium, boys school, and convent that each describe the history and significance of each location. Included with each survey are prints and pictures printed in color of each property, as well as maps. </p><p>St. Teresa of Avila was founded in 1874, and the Girls School was founded in 1912. Rehabilitation of the buildings by the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York began in 2009. </p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The purpose of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), a division of the National Parks Service, is to document historic structure and preserve architectural heritage. At the time of donation, St. Teresa's was under the process of being renovated by the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY) for reuse as a training facility for state court officers. Due to the school's status as eligible for registry on the State and National Listing of Historic Places, it is stipulated that the HABS materials must be housed at a local repository. As such, the prints, negatives, and inventory forms were donated to the BHS by Matthew Stanley of DASNY in 2012.</p>  </bioghist>
