    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Kenneth Neill Cameron (1908-1994), was a scholar of Percy Byshhe Shelley's writings and social and political milieu, best known for his four-volume Shelley and His Circle (1961-1970), and a Communist activist and author. Cameron was born in 1908 in Barrow-in-Furness, Lancashire, England. He moved with his parents to Montreal in 1914, where he lived until he received his B.A. from McGill in 1931. As a Rhodes Scholar, he attended Oxford University and received a second B.A. in 1933, a D. Litt. in 1934, and an M.A. in 1936. He also received a Ph.D. in 1939 from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and, much later, an honorary Ph.D. from McGill University in 1970.</p><p>Cameron first encountered radical politics in England, partly through his uncle Jack Cameron, who was a radical shipyard worker in Liverpool, and partly through campus activism at Oxford. In 1934 he visited the U.S.S.R. and was deeply moved by what he saw. Cameron joined the Canadian Communist Party around 1935. In 1936 he was the Toronto Executive Secretary of the League against War and Fascism.</p><p>At the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Cameron studied under the scholar William Emery Leonard, and continued his activism in the Communist Party of the United States. In the fall of 1939, Cameron began what was to be a thirteen-year career at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he was especially active in the American Federation of Teachers and was also involved with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. At Indiana University, Cameron lived for a short while with Salvadore Luria, later a Nobel Laureate in Physics. Around the same time (1946), he married Mary Bess Owen, a professor of sociology.</p><p>In 1951, as the political climate became more hostile to Communists, partly as a result of the success of his first book, <emph render="italic">The Young Shelley: Genesis of a Radical </emph>(1950), Cameron left Indiana University and was given a job at the private Carl H. Pforzheimer Library, now part of the New York Public Library, in New York City. He edited <emph render="italic">Shelley and His Circle</emph>, overseeing the first four volumes produced by that library. During the 1950s, he was active in the disarmament movement in New York. In the 1960s he began teaching at New York University, first as an adjunct, and then as a full-time professor in 1963. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 for ongoing research on Shelley, which culminated in the publication of <emph render="italic">Shelley: The Golden Years</emph>, in 1974</p><p>In his later years, Cameron was involved in the movements against the Vietnam War, the far right, and nuclear testing. He was Professor Emeritus of English at NYU from 1974-75, and then retired. While his Shelley scholarship did not end here, he chiefly wrote on a number of other topics in the 1970s and 1980s, producing a book of poems in 1977, as well as several books on Marxism, a biography of Joseph Stalin, ecology, and a world history. He also wrote several unpublished manuscripts on Shelley, various Communist leaders and statesmen, including an unpublished book on Enver Hoxha, Communist leader of Albania, four unpublished plays, and his unfinished autobiography. He died in March, 1994.</p><p> Books by Cameron in chronological order:</p><p><list><item><emph render="italic">The Young Shelley: Genesis of a Radical</emph>, Macmillan, 1950</item><item>Editor, <emph render="italic">Percy Bysshe Shelley: Selected Poetry and Prose</emph>, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1951</item><item><emph render="italic">The Enormous Turtle</emph> (comic novel under the pseudonym Warren Madden), Bobbs-Merrill, 1954</item><item><emph render="italic">The Esdaile Notebook: A volume of Early Prose and Poetry by Shelley</emph> (1964)</item><item><emph render="italic">Shelley and His Circle</emph> (1961-1970)</item><item><emph render="italic">Romantic Rebels; Essays on Shelley and his Circle</emph> (1973)</item><item><emph render="italic">Humanity and Society: A World History</emph> (1973)</item><item><emph render="italic">Shelley: The Golden Years</emph> (1974)</item><item><emph render="italic">Marx and Engels Today: A Modern Dialogue on Philosophy and History</emph> (1976)</item><item><emph render="italic">Poems for Lovers and Rebels</emph> (Privately printed, 1977)</item><item><emph render="italic">Marxism: The Science of Society—An Introduction</emph> (1985) </item><item><emph render="italic">Stalin, Man of Contradiction</emph> (1987)</item><item><emph render="italic">Atmospheric Destruction and Human Survival</emph> (1992)</item><item><emph render="italic">Marxism: A Living Science</emph> (1993)</item><item><emph render="italic">Dialectical Materialism and Modern Science</emph> (1995)</item></list> </p><p> Sources: </p><p><list><item>See also, "Town and Gown: Excerpt from the Bloomington, Indiana Memoir of Kenneth Neill Cameron, Communist Academic in the Working Class Movement."

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p><emph render="bold">Series I, Biographical</emph>, is divided into four subseries: <emph render="bold">A: Autobiography:</emph> Cameron began a full-length autobiography, but left it unfinished. The first seven chapters provide a detailed account of his life from 1908-1952, while the rest of the chapters are in rough draft format. Also included in this section are Cameron's notes and research for the autobiography, as well as several profiles of him written by colleagues in his literary field, including one Donald Reiman; <emph render="bold">B: Political Papers, Reviews, Clippings, and Notes</emph>: This section contains Cameron's FBI file, as well as documents and clippings from his political activities. It also contains book reviews and a "Personal Political Statement." <emph render="bold">C: Miscellaneous Biographical Material</emph>: contains various diplomas and grant applications which list Cameron's academic activities; <emph render="bold">D: Correspondence</emph>: Cameron kept a very active correspondence with his political uncle Jack in Liverpool. Also included in this section are business-related letters from academic institutions, as well as various personal letters, from Howard Fast, Salvadore Luria, Mrs. David Erdman, and other friends and family. <emph render="bold">NOTE: This collection is housed offsite and advance notice is required for use.</emph></p><p><emph render="bold">Series II, Shelley</emph>, is divided into four subseries; <emph render="bold">A: Shelley Correspondence</emph>: This section contains letters to and from colleagues in the literary field. William Emery Leonard and Carl H. Pforzheimer are just two of the numerous scholars who consulted Cameron on the subject of Shelley; <emph render="bold">B: Notes, Reports, and Memos</emph>: As editor of the Pforzheimer Library's Shelley collection, Cameron wrote up numerous reports and memos on the cataloging process and various acquisitions. Also documented is an exhibit of Lord Abinger's Shelley materials, and a research trip taken by Cameron in 1961; <emph render="bold">C: Articles</emph>: A number of articles on Shelley and Shelley scholarship. This section includes an early article by Elizabeth Cameron (Cameron's first wife) on Mary Wollstonecraft and an article by Cameron on Shelley and Marx from 1979; <emph render="bold">D: Reviews</emph>: This section contains reviews of Cameron's works, his replies to those reviews, and some correspondence with publishers of his Shelley scholarship.</p><p><emph render="bold">Series III, Other Writings</emph>, is divided into three subseries: <emph render="bold">A: Novel and Plays</emph>: Cameron's comic novel The Enormous Turtle was published in 1954; this is an earlier draft, titled The Avenging Turtle, from around 1950. There are also four unpublished plays, two of which are also unfinished. One is about Shelley and the other three seem to be about political matters. <emph render="bold">B: Poetry</emph>: Cameron wrote poetry over the entire course of his life but the majority of his efforts were contained in the years 1950-1967. In this section are several drafts of some poems, but mostly one of each. The poems are both personal (some are quite graphic) and political. <emph render="bold">C: Marx Dialogues</emph>: Cameron wrote this rather long manuscript around 1971 and spent the next five years searching for a publisher. He eventually had them published, but in a much shorter form, as Marx and Engels Today: A Modern Dialogue on Philosophy and History (1976). This manuscript is his original version. The section also contains the publisher's rejection letters, as well as correspondence with figures such as Howard Zinn, Amiri Baraka, E. P. Thompson, Al Pinkney, Corliss Lamont, Herbert Aptheker, Andrew Rothstein, and Irwin Silber, from whom Cameron was trying to get pre-publication comments.</p><p><emph render="bold">Series IV, Miscellaneous Unprocessed</emph>: This series contains published and unpublished writings and correspondence related thereto, some personal correspondence, including correspondence with Communist historian Herbert Aptheker, a folder relating to the W. Alphaeus Hunton College Teachers' Club of the CPUSA, and one relating to efforts to defend former East German Communists from prosecution. The manuscripts include an unpublished biography of Enver Hoxha, Communist leader of Albania, whole or partial drafts of several of his published works, chapter length published and unpublished writings on Nikolai Bukharin, Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedung, sociobiology, and various Marxist-oriented historical and philosophical topics.</p>  </scopecontent>
