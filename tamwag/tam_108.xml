It challenged a number of statutes such as Pennsylvania's restrictions on minority party candidates, Florida's ten cent filing fees, loyalty oaths in Illinois, and age requirements for candidates and voters. The collection consists of court documents, including transcripts, motions and appeals, as well as brochures and other publicity material.</abstract>
