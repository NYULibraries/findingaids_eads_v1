            <abstract id="ref80" label="Abstract">This collection contains records relating to Cyrus Adler's involvement with New York City political and community organizations between 1952 and 2011. Adler, a long-time resident of Manhattan's upper west side, founded Shorewalkers, Inc., in 1982 to preserve and protect the Hudson River waterfront, and the largest portion of the collection relates to that organization. Among the other organizations represented are the 97th Street Block Association, Village Independent Democrats, Broadway Independent Democrats, and Scientists and Engineers for Kennedy and other candidates.</abstract>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Cyrus Adler was born in Brooklyn in 1927, and for many years taught oceanography, physics, and math at City College of New York, Long Island University, and other educational institutions. A long time resident of Manhattan’s upper west side, Adler has since the 1950’s been very involved in community and political organizations. He played a leading role in the West 97th/98th Street Block Association and their efforts to transform a defunct restroom into a community and information center. In addition, Adler was active in many New York-based democratic polical organizations, such as the Riverside Democrats and the Stevensonian Democratic Club.. Adler also played a role in various transporation initiatives in the 1970’s and 1980’s, advocating for projects like the Westway Highway Tunnel and Central Park Tunnel to move vehicular traffic underground and create more park space for the public.</p>
            <p>In 1982, Adler founded Shorewalkers, Inc., a not-for-profit organization founded to promote greater access to New York’s waterfront, encourage shore walking, and advance preservation and enhancement of metropolitan shorelines. At the time, large portions of the New York-New Jersey shoreline were inaccessible and/or lined with trash and rubble. As the urban shipping industry declined, abandoned piers were inhabited by homeless people and drug dealers. By organizing hikes and excursions along waterfront areas throughout the metropolitan region, Shorewalkers helped spur their transformation into parks and greenways. In particular, their efforts contributed to the creation of the Hudson River Greenway, the 11-mile route from Battery Park to the George Washington Bridge. Adler has written several books, and numerous articles and reviews.</p>

                    <p>This series contains fliers, bulletins, minutes, correspondence, and photos from several Upper West Side community organizations with which Adler was affiliated. The bulk of the materials relate to the 97th Street Block Association. Adler served as President and coordinator of the Association during the 1970s and 1980s, and he and other members converted an abandonded comfort station into a neighborhood safety and information center called the West Flank Safety and Information Center (WFSIC). When completed, the community center provided area residents a first aid station and recreation center, and ultimately helped revitalize the community by reducing crime. Several letters from Adler discuss the challenges in working with the Broadway Mall Association (BMA) to transform the comfort station into the information center. The materials document the evolution of the comfort station into the community center.</p>

                    <p>This series contains fliers, correspondence, news clippings, and other materials about the various transportation initiatives Adler took part in during the late decades of the 20th century. The bulk of the materials pertain to the Westway Highway Tunnel Project during the 1970s and 1980s. Developed by Governor Rockefeller's Urban Development Corp., the Westway Plan gained support after a section of the West Side Highway (WSH) collapsed in 1973. This massive project called for new landfill to extend 1,000 feet into the river, a sunken two-tiered highway, parks, and new real estate development. Many New Yorkers supported this plan, including Adler, who argued that this new highway would be used by trucks and cars, eliminate pollution, transform the waterfront, and act as a catalyst for the redevelopment of the West Side. The Westway received approval from both city and the Federal government, but the proposal was rejected in 1985 due to environmental issues. The various documents included in this series capture both the supporting and opposing viewpoints of the project and what led to its demise.</p>
                    <p>Among the various organizations that Mr. Adler was involved with to promote the Westway Highway was the Scientists' Committee for Public Information, Inc. (SCPI). Founded in 1958, SCPI was an organization of scientists, physicians, and engineers whose purpose was to objectively evaluate technical issues of a project that would allow the public to make informed decisions. The SCPI's Transportation subcommittee acted as coordinator for several teams of experts who examined the various subsections of the West Side Highway Project Environmental Impact Statement. Also included are materials on two subsequent proposals to restore the West Side Highway: the Route 9A Reconstruction Project and the Miller Highway Project.</p>
                    <p>There is also a small amount of material on Adler's efforts to improve bus service and the Central Park Toll Tunnel.</p>

                    <p>Shorewalkers, Inc. was founded in 1982 by Cyrus Adler and other environmentalists to explore the entire waterfront and shore trails in the New York Metropolitan area. Shorewalkers' mission is to explore, enhance, enjoy, and protect the parks, promenades, and paths along the waters in and around the greater New York metropolitan region. Shorewalkers’ first hike took place Sunday, December 12, 1982 along the west coast of Manhattan. Their announcement read: "Explore the changing Hudson River Coast, Battery Park, the Westway Route, active piers, through Penn-Central railroad yards and into Riverside Park. Lunch stop in Harlem. Wilderness above the George Washington Bridge, wind up in an Irish pub in Inwood." They ventured along Manhattan's waterfront at a time when the Manhattan waterfront greenway was not a accessible as it is today. Since 1982, thousands of people have explored the New York, Newark, and Jamaica Bays; the Hudson, Bronx, Hackensack, and Passaic Rivers; the Gowanus, Newtown, and other inlets; the Croton Aqueduct; the Long Island Sound, and Atlantic Ocean among other waterways. Among their most well known walks are The Great Saunter, an annual all day hike along Manhattan's 32-mile shoreline, and the annual Walk off the Turkey (WOTT), a post-Thanksgiving Day hike. Shorewalkers' continues to promote the Hudson River Shore Trail, a 315-mile trail along the Hudson River up through New York state ending at Bear Mountain, known as the "Batt to Bear Trail." The Shorewalkers' efforts to preserve the Hudson River shoreline contributed to the creation of the Waterfront Greenway enjoyed by New Yorker's today. Among the organization's many supporters was the folk singer Pete Seeger, who wrote the lyrics for the Shorewalkers' Saunter.</p>

                    <p>This series contains Adler's administrative files for Shorewalkers, Inc. Materials include mission statements, minutes, records of annual meetings, newsletters, press coverage, correspondence, financial reports, fliers, certificates, member lists, and sign up sheets. In addition to documenting the growth of this particular organization, these materials relate to broader topics such as city planning, environmental issues, health, recreation, and clubs and organizations.</p>
                    <p>This series also contains photographs taken on many walks during the 1980s and 1990s. The photos document the various locations in and around New York that Shorewalkers members walked including: lower Manhattan, Central Park, Harlem, the West Side HIghway, Washington Heights and Inwood, the South Bronx, Coney Island, Red Hook, Far Rockway Bungalows, Bay Ridge, Jamaica Bay, and bridges. The photos also captured walks along the Hudson River Shore Trail with places such as Croton Creek, West Point, the Albany River, Bear Mountain, Newburgh, Storm King State Park, Cold Spring, and Poughkeepsie, NY. Many photos, particularly those of the Hudson River waterfront, document what the areas looked like before development.</p>

                        <p>These photographic materials were originally housed in brown envelopes that included photographic prints, negatives, and in some cases, handwritten notes. Each envelope is numbered; Adler used a numbering system that appears to be based on the year and month the photos were taken. Photographs are arranged chronologically using Adler's numbering system, rather than by subject.</p>
                        <p>For preservation purposes, photos and negatives have been removed from their orginal envelopes and are housed separately in acid-free envelopes. Photographs are boxed separately from negatives. Some of the negatives in the collection were not printed, so researchers should consult both photograph and negative boxes for a complete set of images.</p>
                        <p>There are also two folders of negatives from the 1990's that are separately housed in Box 10 because of their size. Box 10 also includes one folder of contact sheets from the 1990's. Each of these retains Adler's original number so that they can be correlated with any related photographic prints and the original enevelopes in which they were housed.</p>
                        <p>The original envelopes have also been retained, and are housed in boxes 15-17. These envelopes contain handwritten notes and should be consulted for additional contextual information about the images.</p>
