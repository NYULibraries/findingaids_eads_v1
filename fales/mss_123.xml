    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Wendy Perron is a dancer, teacher, writer, and author of <emph render="italic">Through the Eyes of a Dancer</emph> (Wesleyan University Press, 2013). She started her career as a dancer and choreographer in New York in the early 1970s. A member of the Trisha Brown Company from 1975 to 1978, she also danced for such choreographers as Kenneth King, Rudy Perez, Sara Rudner, and Twyla Tharp. She choreographed more than 40 pieces for the Wendy Perron Dance Company from 1983 from 1997. From 1976 to 78 she wrote for, and at times edited, the "Concepts in Performance" page of the <emph render="italic">Soho Weekly News</emph>. Perron has also written for the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, the <emph render="italic">Village Voice</emph>, <emph render="italic">Dance Europe</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Dance Magazine</emph>, where she was editor in chief from 2004 to 2013. </p><p>Since the 1970s, Perron has taught aspects of dance at Bennington, Princeton, NYU, City College of New York, and Rutgers and has been a guest teacher, lecturer, or adjudicator, across the country. In 2011 she was the first dance artist inducted into the New York Foundation for the Arts Hall of Fame. Currently she teaches a graduate seminar in the dance department of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. She also writes commentary for her own website at wendyperron.com.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Wendy Perron Papers (dated 1973-2001) consist of a collected run of Perron's "Concepts in Performance" column, published in <emph render="italic">The Soho Weekly News</emph> from 1976-1978, as well as programs, flyers, and other ephemera from dance performances in the 1970s and 1980s. In her column, Perron reviews a range of experimental performance practices that flourished in New York during the late 1970s. Among these are Steve Paxton's Contact Improvisation, Laurie Anderson's sound performances involving electric violin, Trisha Brown's Accumulation pieces, and Merce Cunningham's integrations of dance, music, and theatre. Other artists and ensembles whose performances Perron reviews are John Cage, Lucinda Childs, Michael Kirby, Jackson Mac Low, Meredith Monk, Yvonne Rainer, Stuart Sherman, Squat Theatre, and Robert Wilson.</p><p>Perron is among the earliest critics to write about the genre known as "Performance Art." In the 1970s, "Performance Art" came to designate experimental forms of embodied expression that fell outside the conventional categories of theatre, dance, or music. Her writing combines thick description and critical analysis, a combination which not only allows readers to visualize the performances that occurred, but also sheds light on the aesthetic, political, and theoretical issues underlying a given piece. Moreover, she is knowledgeable about the historical circumstances under which performance art emerged in New York and thus is able to identify the central characteristics informing performance art of the 1970s and to distinguish it from 1960s experimental theatre.</p>  </scopecontent>
