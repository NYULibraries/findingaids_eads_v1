            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The Larry Spruch Papers contain diverse materials generated throughout Spruch's career. The materials date from between 1943, when Spruch enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania as a Ph.D. candidate in physics, and 2004, two years before Spruch’s death. They document Spruch’s activities as a Professor of Physics at New York University; as a prominent researcher into aspects of theoretical nuclear and particle physics and astrophysics; as a frequent presenter and attendee of physics conferences; and as a writer of published academic papers, nonfiction works for a general audience, and of mathematical and logic puzzles with science and sports as their subject matter. Some personal materials, largely documenting Spruch’s travels and interests in progressive politics and theatre, are also included in the collection. Formats of materials in the collection include lecture notes, examination forms, unpublished dissertations and theses, correspondence and memoranda, conference programs, reprints and preprints of academic papers, research proposals, handwritten notes and manuscripts, and news clippings. A small number of photographs are also present in Series VII.</p>
            <p>The materials in the collection are arranged into series and subseries according to the functions by which they were created and used. The contents of each series and subseries are described in more detail in the series-level scope and content notes.</p>

            <head>Processing Information note</head>
            <p>The Larry Spruch Papers were partially processed by several different staff members over a period of several years. As such, the original order has been lost. However, certain aspects of the final arrangement imposed by the archivist are meant to reflect the order in which Larry Spruch seems to have originally kept them, insofar as that order could be perceived. (See the series-level Scope and Content notes for further information about the original order of materials in those series.)</p>
            <p>Folder titles are likewise not original. Spruch did not supply titles for many of the folders in which he kept materials, and other folder titles which Spruch did supply were incomprehensible to non-specialist readers. Those supplied folder titles have been edited for clarity, though hopefully without losing the spirit of Spruch's original title.</p>

            <head>Biography of Larry Spruch</head>
            <p>Theoretical physicist Larry Spruch (1923-2006) was a longtime member of the faculty of the Department of Physics at New York University. He was born on January 1, 1923, in Brooklyn, New York, and earned a B.S. from Brooklyn College in 1943. He then enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania as a Ph.D. candidate in Physics. His thesis work, "On the beta decay of the triton" (1948), was supervised by Leonard I. Schiff.</p>
            <p>While attending the University of Pennsylvania, Spruch was an instructor from 1943 to 1946 and a Tyndale Fellow from 1946 to 1948. After earning his Ph.D., he became an Atomic Energy Commission Postdoctoral Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working on problems in nuclear physics with Herman Feshbach and Victor Weisskopf. After two years at MIT, Spruch accepted the position of Assistant Professor at New York University in 1950. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1955 and full Professor in 1961. Upon his official retirement in 1994, he was honored with Professor Emeritus status.</p>
            <p>Spruch taught a variety of courses for graduate and undergraduate students at NYU. Some would be expected of a professor with a background in theoretical nuclear and atomic physics: Scattering Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, and Mathematical Physics, among others. Yet he also taught a series of courses intended to make physics accessible to non-majors, by illustrating its relevance to everyday life in layman’s terms. These courses included Physics and Society, Physics for Poets, and Intelligent Life in the Universe. As of 1998, Spruch had also supervised 21 Ph.D. dissertations and 17 postdoctoral fellowships at NYU.</p>
            <p>In addition to teaching, Spruch was a very active researcher. His work covered a wide range of issues in nuclear and particle physics, as well as selected topics in astrophysics. Throughout the course of his career, he published over 150 scientific papers in journals such as 
                <emph render="italic">The Physical Review</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Journal of Mathematical Physics</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">Nuclear Physics</emph>. He also served as guest editor, with James F. Babb and Peter W. Milonni, of a special issue of 
                <emph render="italic">Comments on Modern Physics</emph> on Casimir forces in 2000. Spruch is best known for his developments in scattering theory, investigations of Casimir forces, and contributions to the problem of determining necessary conditions for the existence of bound states. He frequently collaborated with other physicists in conducting research, most notably Edward Gerjuoy, Yukap Hahn, Edward Kelsey, Thomas F. O’Malley, A. R. P. Rau, Leonard Rosenberg, and Robin Shakeshaft.</p>
            <p>Spruch further contributed to his field through service as a member of the editorial boards of 
                <emph render="italic">The Physical Review A</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">Zeitschrift für Physik A</emph>, a correspondent for 
                <emph render="italic">Comments on Atomic and Molecular Physics</emph>, and a consultant for Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. He also served as part of a delegation of scholars for the China-U.S. Physics Examination and Application (CUSPEA) program. CUSPEA was an examination and admission system used by the physics departments of selected American and Canadian universities for graduate student applicants from the People's Republic of China between 1979 and 1989. Along with other physics professors from participating North American universities, Spruch assisted with interviewing applicants and the preparation of exam questions. He traveled to China in 1985 as part of his work with CUSPEA.</p>
            <p>Spruch’s career was marked by numerous awards and honors. Highlights include the Atomic Energy Commission Fellowship (1948-50), National Science Foundation Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship for the University of London and Oxford University (1963-64), Brooklyn College’s Alumni Award for Merit (1967), membership in the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University (1981), the Alexander von Humboldt Award (1985), the NYU Golden Dozen Teaching Award (1991), and the Davisson-Germer Prize (1992). For the Alexander von Humboldt Award, Spruch cooperated on a long-term research project with colleagues at the Max Planck Institut Für Kernphysik in Heidelberg, Germany. In addition to these awards, Spruch attended and spoke at more than 100 conferences around the world, and attended the summer Aspen Center for Physics in Aspen, Colorado, for 30 years.</p>
            <p>Larry Spruch shared with his wife, the physicist Grace Marmor Spruch, an interest in making science and mathematics accessible and interesting to the general public. The pair co-authored a series of quizzes which appeared monthly in the magazine 
                <emph render="italic">The Sciences</emph>, and were later collected and published as 
                <emph render="italic">21 Astounding Science Quizzes!</emph> The Spruchs also published 
                <emph render="italic">The Ubiquitous Atom!</emph>, a book which describes the foundations of atomic physics and its applications to biology, genetics, medicine, and archaeology. Larry Spruch spent several years developing and refining a collection of mathematics and logic puzzles with a sports theme, but that manuscript remains unpublished.</p>
            <p>After his official retirement, Larry Spruch continued his physics research at New York University. He died on August 10, 2006, in New York City.</p>

                    <p>Series I contains materials dating from between 1950 and 1999, created through Larry Spruch’s activities as a professor of Physics at New York University. The series is divided into three subseries.</p>
                    <p>Subseries A: Course Materials contains lecture notes, problem books, quizzes, and exams from the undergraduate and graduate level Physics courses which Spruch taught. It also contains news clippings and other materials used in Spruch’s popular Physics and Society course, which discussed the relationship between physics and current events and was geared toward non-Physics majors. Some preliminary examinations for the Ph.D. in Physics dating from between 1967 and 1990 are included in the series. Finally, a few folders of materials from NYU courses which Spruch may have audited, such as Literature of Modern Ireland, are present in Subseries A.</p>
                    <p>Subseries B: Faculty and Administrative Affairs contains materials related to Spruch’s non-teaching duties at NYU. As such, it includes memoranda and other materials reflecting the activities of the Physics department and the larger NYU faculty. It also contains documentation of Spruch’s activities while on sabbatical from NYU.</p>
                    <p>Subseries C: Student Theses and Dissertations includes drafts and final copies of theses and dissertations which were created under Spruch’s supervision, or in which Spruch took an interest.</p>

                    <p>Series II is largely made up of Larry Spruch’s professional correspondence, as well as some personal correspondence. The majority of the correspondence in the Larry Spruch Papers is located in this series, though the occasional letter may also be found in Series IV and Series V, as Spruch filed correspondence about certain articles or projects alongside the other related materials.</p>

                    <p>Series III contains materials from Larry Spruch’s participation in the China-U.S. Physics Examination and Application (CUSPEA) program in the 1980s. Drafts and final copies of exams in English and Physics which Spruch helped to develop are included, as are Spruch’s correspondence with other CUSPEA-affiliated physicists and the administrators of the program. A diary and ephemera from Spruch’s 1985 trip to China, which was taken under the auspices of the program to interview prospective graduate students, are also included in this series.</p>

                    <p>Series IV encompasses various aspects of Larry Spruch’s participation in the international community of physics scholars. The series is divided into four subseries.</p>
                    <p>Subseries A: Manuscript and Research Proposal Referrals contains Spruch’s reviews of manuscripts submitted by other physicists for publication in various academic journals, as well as reviews of a handful of research proposals. These materials are not open to researchers.</p>
                    <p>Subseries B: Works by Other Physicists contains published articles and manuscripts to which Spruch did not personally contribute, but in which he seems to have taken a professional interest. Nearly all of these materials are heavily annotated by Spruch, and many are also accompanied by his own calculations of problems discussed in the texts, or his correspondence with the authors. The arrangement system of this subseries is somewhat complex because it maintains some aspects of the collection’s original order. For example, while Spruch seems to have generally grouped materials of this type together by author and arranged the folders in alphabetical order by the author’s last name, some materials were also grouped topically or by the publication in which they appeared. The materials in this subseries date from between 1927 and 2004, though the bulk of them date from between 1950 and 2002.</p>
                    <p>Subseries C: Conferences, Workshops, and Seminars contains materials from professional gatherings, many of them international, in which Spruch participated or simply attended. These materials include notes on presentations given by Spruch or other physicists, event programs, correspondence with event organizers and participants, and documentation of Spruch’s travel to and from the events. Especially well-represented in this series are materials from the Aspen Center for Physics, a summer research program in Aspen, Colorado in which Spruch participated frequently. The materials in this subseries date from between 1956 and 2003.</p>
                    <p>Subseries D: Awards and Honors contains materials related to some—though not all—of the numerous awards and honors which Larry Spruch received throughout his career. Many of the materials included in the series are related to a website created by the NYU Physics department in 2000 in honor of Larry Spruch. Spruch’s Brooklyn College Alumni Award of Honor in this subseries dates from 1967, though the other materials date from the latter part of his career, between 1984 and 2001.</p>

                    <p>Series V contains materials generated by Larry Spruch and his collaborators while conducting and publishing research in theoretical particle physics and astrophysics. It is divided into four subseries. Subseries A: Published contains examples of Spruch’s and his collaborators’ work in its final, published format, usually as reprints or preprints. Drafts and earlier versions of many of these materials are also included in Subseries B: Drafts and Unpublished Writings. Subseries C: Notes and Calculations contains the least formal documents in this series. It is largely composed of notes and calculations on various issues in physics, some of which reappear in more polished form in Subseries A and B. Many of the materials in Subseries C, in particular, may be obscure in meaning to researchers without extensive backgrounds in physics, as their contents are expressed mathematically rather than in grammatical English. Finally, Subseries D: Research Proposals and Contracts contains proposals and contracts for grants to fund research in which Larry Spruch participated. Most of the materials in the series concern funding from the National Science Foundation; however, the Army Research Office and the Office of Naval Research are also represented.</p>

                    <p>Series VII contains materials related to Larry Spruch’s personal life, rather than his work as a physicist. Many of the materials in this series are maps, souvenirs, and other tourist ephemera gathered by Spruch during his travels around the world. Though much of that travel was the result of Spruch’s participation in the conferences, seminars, and workshops (see Series IV: Subseries C), he made time to explore the area as well. Other materials in the series are related to Spruch’s personal interests, which included theatre and progressive politics. The materials in this series date from between 1948 and 2002.</p>

                    <p>Series VIII contains materials related to another of Larry Spruch’s hobbies, writing puzzles. A copy of 
                        <emph render="italic">21 Astounding Science Quizzes!</emph>, written with his wife, Grace Marmor Spruch, is included in this series. However, the rest of the materials relate to the development of a manuscript of sports-themed puzzles which Spruch continued to expand and refine between 1965 and 1996. The manuscript remains unpublished.</p>
