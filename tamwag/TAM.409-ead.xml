            <p>Robert Bender was a member of Students for a Democratic Society. He was a political activist in Newark, NJ, in his early years, and served for two years (1962-1964) as Executive Director of New Jersey Americans for Democratic Action. During his tenure at ADA he guided the organization toward ever-deeper involvement in the civil rights movement. He stepped down in 1964 to pursue a Masters degree at Rutgers University's Labor-Management Institute. He went on to be associated professionally with a number of labor and political organizations in New Jersey, and was a member of the Solidarity Singers and New Jersey Peace Action, among other groups.</p>
