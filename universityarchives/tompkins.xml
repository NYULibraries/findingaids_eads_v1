            <head>Biography</head>
            <p>Leslie J. Tompkins began his fifty-year NYU career as an undergraduate in 1886. During the 1890-1891 academic year, Tompkins enrolled in Columbia University's Law School, but transferred to NYU Law as a student and legal clerk during its reorganization in the fall of 1891. Tompkins graduated and gained admission to the Bar of New York in 1892. In May of that year then-Chancellor Henry M. MacCracken appointed Tompkins as the University's Assistant Treasurer and Librarian. Tompkins' responsibilities as Assistant Treasurer included overseeing the University's grounds and buildings, maintaining the University's books, collecting tuition fees, and acting as NYU's disbursing officer. NYU consolidated many of these duties under the title of the Registrar, a position Tompkins assumed in 1894. In 1896 Tompkins took interest in the newly consolidated Law School (as NYU absorbed the Metropolis Law School in the fall of 1895) and served (unofficially) as its Secretary until 1906. In 1898, at the advice of the Law School's Dean Clarence Ashley, Tompkins began teaching law classes at NYU. In 1906, Tompkins relinquished his several offices and settled down as Professor of Law and Secretary of the Law School. He served as Secretary until 1918 and thereafter devoted his efforts solely to his professorship. Tompkins' connection with NYU continued until September 1940, when he retired and assumed the position of Emeritus Professor of Law. Tompkins served NYU during a formative period in the University's history, affording him a close relationship with Chancellor MacCracken, insight into the University's management, and the opportunity to observe the formation of the Heights Campus, the reorganization of the Schools of Law and Medicine, and the formation of the School of Commerce.</p>
