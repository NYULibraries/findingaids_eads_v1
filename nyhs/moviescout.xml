            <p>This collection has been organized by donor into two series. The photographs retain their original organization into the categories assigned by each location scout manager. Both series cover the same time period and there is considerable overlap in the location categories. Categories within each series have been listed alphabetically, which means that box numbers do not appear in chronological order in the finding aid.</p>

            <p>This collection spans the time period between the 1980s to the 2000s and contains an extensive range of images of locations in New York, primarily Manhattan, created for two New York-based location scout managers (Lyn Pinezich and Steve Horn).</p>
            <p>Each location is represented by multiple color snapshots, which were then glued into file folders. All folders contain numerous photographs of each location including both exterior and interior shots. The photographs depict a broad range of locations such as abandoned buildings, offices and office spaces, famous landmarks, streets of New York, and residences. It essentially provides a snapshot of New York City during this time period. Many of the locations within the collection are not in existence anymore.</p>
            <p>The photographs have been rehoused into 198 bankers boxes but remain organized in the categories originally assigned by the location scouts (for example; bars, residences, streets, buildings, etc). The folders within each category are arranged either alphabetically or by neighborhood.</p>

            <p>Location scouting is a vital process in the pre-production stage of the film and television industry. Once writers and producers have decided on the style of scenery and locations they require, they turn to location scouts to provide them with suitable locations that meet these requirements.</p>
            <p>Typically, location scouts and/or managers meet with production teams to discuss their needs and will scout for locations based on their requirements. They also generally have portfolios put together of certain locations that they have deemed interesting beforehand in order to have a database of locations in case of requests. The role of location managers encompasses multiple responsibilites, including: having an understanding of the production to ensure that appropriate locations are being researched and scouted; negotiating legal access to filming locations; negotiating prices, terms and conditions with location owners; and creating written agreements between the production company and venue owner and organizing any permits necessary.</p>
            <p>A location scout is expected to take descriptive, panoramic photographs that depict a particular location's possibilities. Before the advent of digital photography, panoramas were created by pasting multiple photographic prints into a manilla folder. This practice continued into the time period of this collection, which includes separate donations of location scout photos by two New York-based location managers, Steve Horn and Lyn Pinezich. The collection reflects the beginning of the revitalization of the film industry in New York City that was later to become a hallmark of Mayor Bloomberg's administration.</p>
