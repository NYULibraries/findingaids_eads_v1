    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Founded in 1984, Autonomedia is a North American publisher of radical theoretical works, especially in the anarchist tradition. Autonomedia publishes books on topics such as anarchism, Marxist works, cyberfeminism, drug literature, turn of the 21st century queer individualist anarchist novels, and other works. They are known for publishing the "Autonomedia Calendar of Jubilee Saints," in which every day of the calendar recalls a deceased person of some significance to progressive movements or thought. They also maintain the InterActivist Info Exchange, an online forum for discourse and debate on themes relevant to the books that they publish.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>http://www.autonomedia.org/, http://bookstore.autonomedia.org/, http://interactivist.autonomedia.org/, http://slash.interactivist.net/, and http://slash.autonomedia.org/ were initially selected by Tamiment curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in circa 2007-2009 as part of the Alternative Mass Media / News Web Sites Web Archive. In November 2015, these websites were migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In 2015, http://www.autonomedia.org/, http://interactivist.autonomedia.org/, and http://bookstore.autonomedia.org/ was transferred to Fales Libary.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>In 2014, the Autonomedia archived website was added to Tamiment Library Web Collection on Organizations (WEB ARC 003). Crawling of the websites in this collection were ceased in 2018. In 2022, archived websites associated with this collection in the Alternative Mass Media / News Web Sites Web Archive were shared to the Autonomedia Web Archive in Archive-It for access and replay purposes. This finding aid was created in Fall 2022 and description was standardized across the collection.</p>  </processinfo>

<p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl. Certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content.

The forum existed on both subdomains of Interactivist and Autonomedia, http://slash.interactivist.net/ and http://slash.autonomedia.org/, respectively, until 2010.
