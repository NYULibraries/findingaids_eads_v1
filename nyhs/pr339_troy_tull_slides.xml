    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Tull's photographs capture three of the main tourist sites in New York City: Rockefeller Center at Christmas, the Statue of Liberty, and the original World Trade Center. Tull photographed the latter in the early 1970s, when the WTC's twin towers were still under construction. The collection includes general views of Manhattan (the skyline, prominent buildings, bridges, etc.), other locations in the United States (Boston, San Francisco, and Tull's home in Teaneck, New Jersey), Europe (London), and a number of unidentified scenes.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Troy Eugene Tull was born 1 April 1932 in Morrison, Oklahoma, and died 2 September 1995 in Edmond, Oklahoma. Tull was an IBM engineer whose career focused on the creation of UPC (Universal Product Code) technology and point of sale equipment. Between (roughly) 1960 and 1965 he lived and worked for IBM in Poughkeepsie, New York. The company next moved Tull to Boulder, Colorado, to manage the plant there. IBM then brought him back to New York in 1968–1971. During this period Tull lived with his family in Teaneck, New Jersey, and apparently also kept an apartment in Brooklyn. He later moved back to Boulder and then to his native Oklahoma, where he went into sales. </p><p>Tull was a camera enthusiast with his own darkroom who took thousands of rolls of film and photographic slides. He documented scenes that excited him, such as the construction of the original World Trade Center towers, which were rising during his second stint in New York (1968–1971). During a visit to Manhattan in the 1980s, to be close to the towers, he insisted on staying at the adjacent Vista International Hotel (later renamed Marriott World Trade Center).</p><p>[The preceding was adapted from notes supplied by the photographer's son, Michael Tull.]</p>  </bioghist>
