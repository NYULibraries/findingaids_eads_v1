            <abstract id="ref84" label="Abstract">Joseph Selligman, Jr. (1916-1937) served as a solider in the British division of the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War. He died in early 1937 after receiving a head wound in the battle of Jarama. Following his death, his family collected documents relating to the Spanish Civil War and the circumstances surrounding his death. This collection contains a large volume of correspondence, including letters between Joseph Selligman Jr. and his family from 1933-1936 and letters among family members regarding the circumstances of his death. The collection also contains copies of Selligman's academic and personal writings from Swarthmore College.</abstract>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Joseph Selligman Jr. was born on December 25, 1916 in Louisville Kentucky to Esther and Joseph Selligman. He was the second of three children, his eldest sister Augusta was born in 1913 and his younger sister Lucy was born in 1920. His mother, the former Esther Rosenberg, taught kindergarten prior to her marriage to Joseph Selligman Sr. in 1909. His father worked as a lawyer in partnership with his brother Alfred and was also prominent in local politics.</p>
            <p>Joseph Selligman Jr. attended Louisville Men’s High School for three and a half years, graduating early in 1933. He then enrolled in Swarthmore College, a Quaker school in Pennsylvania, at the age of 16 in the fall of 1933. At Swarthmore Selligman wrote for the school’s literary magazine and later became the editor and served on the debate team. In the summer of 1935 Selligman also participated in a Quaker Peace Caravan in Iowa, which promoted peace and non-violent resistance along with other Swarthmore students. In October of his senior year Selligman applied to Harvard for graduate work in philosophy, but in mid-December he left Swarthmore without his parents’ knowledge and traveled to Europe to join the International Brigades fighting in the Spanish Civil War.</p>
            <p>In an attempt to convince him to return Selligman’s father sent his law partner, Joseph Everhart, to Paris, where he had last been heard from. By the time Everhart arrived, however, Selligman had already left for Spain. In Europe, Selligman initially tried to enlist under his own name but was rejected because he was only nineteen years old. He instead enlisted in a British battalion under the name Frank Neary, who was a young Irishman who sold his enlistment papers to Selligman after changing his mind about going to war.</p>
            <p>Selligman entered Spain sometime in late December or early January. By mid-February he was fighting with a British battalion of the International Brigade along the Jarama River. At the battle of Jarama he suffered a head wound and was evacuated to a hospital near Madrid where he died two weeks later. His family believes he was the first American casualty of the Spanish Civil War.</p>

            <p>This collection is arranged in a single series which is housed in four boxes. Much of the correspondence has been placed in folders either thematically or by author. For the most part, folders have not been arranged systematically, rather they have been arranged as much as possible in relation to thier order within thier original boxes. Several newspapers are housed separately in an oversized flat box.</p>

            <head>Appraisal note</head>
            <p>Several newspapers and clippings regarding the Spanish Civil War have been removed from this collection. The large majority of those clippings came from the Louisville Times and the Louisville Courier-Journal after the death of Joseph Selligman Jr. in 1937. Also removed from this collection were several empty envelopes that did not have corresponding letters, otherwise letters and the envelopes they came in were preserved.</p>
