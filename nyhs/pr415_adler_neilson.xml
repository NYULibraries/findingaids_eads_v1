    <head>Arrangement</head>
<p>The files in the collection are foldered by project and run in a rough chronological order, with a few exceptions. These files appear to have been given letter designations at some point running in an alphabetical sequence of A-PP (though there are now gaps, especially in the earliest years), but it is not known what specifically that letter designation referred to. The container list presents the boxed content in this letter designation/chronological order. The box numbers assigned by N-YHS do not mirror the alpha sequence because the numbers were assigned to the boxes as found on the shelves as they were prepared for off-site storage.</p>  </arrangement>
  <bioghist id="aspace_b9baa0752587f842abb4adec17f2c4a7">
    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Queens, NY-based iron work company incorporated March 1920 by Mr. Adler and Henry C. Neilson, and later run by sons David H. Neilson (d. 2005) and Philip B. Neilson (d. 2014).</p><p>Alternate addresses for this company are 51 Clark St., Astoria, NY, (circa 1920), 76 Moultrie St., Brooklyn (circa. 1921-1925), and "Jessie Place near Queens Blvd." (after 1926). "Jessie Place" later became 51st Street, hence the firm's ultimate location at 45-48 51st St, Woodside, NY.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The collection is in orderly condition but has not been processed. All drawings remain folded and in labelled folders, perhaps as originally received by N-YHS. In preparing the collection for offsite storage in 2020, reference librarian Jill Reichenbach did a complete inventory of the project folders in each box, which is presented in this finding aid.</p>  </processinfo>
