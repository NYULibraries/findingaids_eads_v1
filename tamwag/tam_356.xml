            <p>The Cooper Square Community Development Committee and Businessmen’s Association (CSC) is a nonprofit tenant rights and arts advocacy group for residents of New York City’s Lower Eastside that provides social services, including tenant counseling and eviction prevention, and works on community development issues. The organization’s aims are to preserve economic and ethnic diversity in the neighborhood and to contribute to the preservation and development of affordable, environmentally-friendly housing and community/cultural spaces.</p>
            <p>The Committee, which has described itself as “the nation's oldest anti-displacement organization,” was founded in 1959 (then named the Cooper Square Community Development Committee), for the purpose of opposing the City of New York’s urban renewal plan for the Lower Eastside led the City’s Slum Clearance Committee (chaired by “master builder” Robert Moses). CSC’s founders or those involved in the early stages of the organization included Thelma Burdick, Frances Goldin, Esther Rand, Staughton Lynd, and Walter Thabit.</p>
            <p>Throughout the 1960’s, the Committee built coalitions, held demonstrations and CSC representatives and members spoke at public meetings. CSC also created an alternative plan to New York City’s original proposals for redevelopment of the Lower Eastside. “The Alternate Plan,” was a community-based plan (used as a model by many other rights organizations since its creation). Its basic principles were that during development displacement must be minimized, must be carried out in stages, and site tenants must have first priority for the housing that is built. On February 13, 1970 CSC’s Alternate Plan was adopted as the official plan of the City of New York. According to Committee’s own online history, the adoption of the Alternate Plan resulted in the preservation of over 300 buildings, and prevented the displacement of several thousand people, including families, senior citizens, artists and art organizations.</p>
            <p>In the 1970s the Cooper Square Committee worked to develop community leadership on the Lower East Side, organizing the Bowery Residents Committee, the Good Food Co-op, Third Avenue Artists, and also helped start several tenant rights associations to preserve affordable housing. In the 1980s the CSC sponsored development of the Thelma Burdick Building an apartment building for low-income households at 10 Stanton Street, supported a private development of senior citizen housing on 5th Street and the Bowery and attempted to ensure that it would be a racially-integrated building; created a Revised Plan for the Cooper Square Urban Renewal Area that emphasized renovation of city-owned tenements and loft buildings, preservation of affordable housing and new construction of mixed income housing; helped to persuade the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development to approve the development of the 22-unit building for formerly homeless families, to serve as a model for similar projects. The ”Cube Building” is believed to be the first cooperative residence for homeless families in the United States. In the 1990s the organization found itself in the position of becoming a developer itself, in part, when it signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the City of New York, under which the CSC sponsored the renovation of the 22 buildings costing more than $20 million (completed in 2006), and founded the Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association that now manages 356 apartments in 22 formerly city-owned buildings.</p>
            <p>In the 2000s the Cooper Square Committee began organizing cultural groups on East 4th Street to develop a plan for disposition of 4 city-owned cultural buildings and vacant buildings and vacant lots in the neighborhood. Planning efforts culminated in the sale of the city-owned properties to the cultural groups in 2005. Development of the Cooper Square Urban Renewal Area was largely completed by 2008. CSC reported that 846 of the 1,377 new and renovated apartments were low income units (61% of the total) and that the sites contained over 100,000 sq. ft. of cultural space on East 4th Street and 40,000 sq. ft. of recreational space.</p>
            <p>In the 2010s the Cooper Square Committee provides housing counseling and social services to area residents; it reaches out to assist low income buildings needing energy efficiency upgrades and works to identify opportunities to develop low/moderate or middle income housing as well as community/cultural spaces on the Lower East Side. It has also launched projects addressing the lack of accessible housing and public accommodations for disabled citizens, is partnering with another organization to renovate a building for homeless lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgender (LGBT) youths, and has initiated a Tenant Rights Walking Tour of the Lower Eastside.</p>
