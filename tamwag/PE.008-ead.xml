The NMU was founded in 1937, in large measure by former members of the Commnist-led Marine Workers Industrial Union. Purged of its Communist leadership in 1948, the NMU eventually merged with the Seafarers International Union of North America in 2001. The files contain a variety of documents such as newspaper clippings, flyers, brochures, biographical material, convention proceedings, chapter and ships' meeting minutes, correspondence, and other items.</abstract>

            <p>The National Maritime Union of America, which represented workers in the merchant marine, was formed in 1937, as a split from the International Seafarer's Union, which was affiliated with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). At it's first convention in 1937, the NMU joined the Committee for Industrial Organizations (CIO). A crucial role in its formation was played by former members of the Communist-led Marine Workers Industrial Union. Among the notable reforms achieved by the union's Communist-dominated leadership was "checkerboarding," the side-by-side racial integration of sailors' sleeping quarters. The union was led by Joseph Curran, who served for as NMU president until 1981, at which time it was discovered he was to receive a lump sum payment of his pension of $2 million. He eventually agreed to take monthly payments in lieu of the lump sum. During World War II, the alliance of Communists and non-communists in the union was weakened by charges that the Communists, in their desire to maximize productivity to aid the Soviet Union, did not aggressively defend sailors' interests. The Cold War and organized labor's stance thereto exacerbated the ideological divide, and in 1948, the NMU's Communist leadership and its allies were defeated in union elections, then expelled, and subsequently deprived of their sailor's papers by the U.S. Coast Guard. The union was weakened by the loss of these militant members, the rise of foreign-based flag of convenience shipping companies (which drastically reduced NMU membership from its WWII high of over 80,000 members), and internal corruption. Despite this, in 1950, the NMU's Welfare plan was established, providing seamen with health, accident and life insurance benefits. In 1954 a pension component was added. Curran's successor, Shannon Wall, was not well- received my a strong minority of the union, led by James Morrissey, who had run against Wall in previous elections and been attacked and beaten outside the union headquarters in 1966. The Union had members in Panama, the Great Lakes, as well as the East and Gulf Coasts of the United States. In 2001, the NMU merged with the Seafarers International Union of North America, which originally represented West Coast merchant mariners.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The National Maritime Union of America Pamphlet and Ephemera collection consists of papers relating to the activities of the Union and is rich in documenting the politics, including the fierce and at times violent internal struggles between Left and Right factions, personalities, and daily life of the members of the Union. The files contain a variety of documents such as newspaper clippings, flyers, brochures, biographical material, convention proceedings, chapter and ships' meeting minutes, correspondence, and other items. Much of the collection focuses on the leadership of Joseph Curran, who served as President of the Union for from 1937-1981. Most extensively covered is the 1944-1952 struggle to remove Communist and other Left influence from the union, including lengthy transcripts of sometimes violent ship, local port and national meetings. Among the many contentious topics was the nature of, and whether the NMU should participate in the Committee for Maritime Unity, a 1946-7 initiative of West Coast longshoremen's union leader, the Communist-associated Harry Bridges. Also well documented are subsequent internal conflicts, including efforts led by reformer Joe Morrisey in the 1970s-80s. Two histories of the union are included in the collection and provide a detailed look at the founding and history of the union. Some materials reflect the activity of NMU dissident member Henry Spira (1927-1998), later a leader of the animal rights movement and a formative influence on the ethics philosopher Peter Singer.</p>
