            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>In 1966, Betty Friedan founded the National Organization for Women in Washington, D.C., a group whose goal was to "bring women into the mainstream of American society." Three years earlier, her book 
                <title render="italic" type="simple">The Feminine Mystique</title> had hit a nerve with American women (largely white, upper class women), whose discontent with their economic and social opportunities would result in the feminist social activism of the 1960s and 1970s. Not long after the national organization was formed, the New York Chapter was founded in 1967. It was the founding chapter and, arguably in its early days, the most influential chapter, as its victories in New York rippled out into the rest of the country. The motivating force for its early organizing efforts was largely related to employment discrimination in hiring practices and discrepancy in wages between men and women--one of NOW-N.Y.C.'s early victories was the elimination of sex-segregated help-wanted advertisements in the 
                <title render="italic" type="simple">New York Times</title>. However, from its inception, the group was multi-issue, functioning through a committee structure that included committees on the arts, child care, education, employment, the image of women in the media, legislation and politics, reproductive rights, and sexuality.</p>
            <p>NOW-N.Y.C. sponsored large-scale marches and strikes, such as the well known "Women Strike for Equality" march August 26, 1970 in New York City, which became an annual event for NOW for several years. Early on the group focused on media-attention-getting tactics to make its relatively small ranks look larger, such as the "flush-in" outside the offices of Colgate-Palmolive to protest discrimination in hiring practices. The organization also used such mainstream democratic tactics as lobbying legislators, collecting petitions, and sending mass mailings to the White House to put pressure on government officials. The chapter participated in an annual state lobby day with NOW-New York State. In the 1980s, NOW created a group called WomanPower PAC, a political action committee formed to raise money to elect women and feminist leaders to elected office. The first four presidents of NOW-NYC were Jean Faust, Ti Grace Atkinson, Ivy Bottini and Jacqueline Ceballos (the latter in 1971).</p>
            <p>The Education Committee studied the course offerings of girls and boys in New York public schools in the 1970s, and its report was so much in demand, it went into four printings. New York schools and schools across the country began changing their course offerings as a result of this committee's work. In the mid-seventies it began addressing the issue of rape, and its Rape Prevention Committee was one of the first of its kind, offering myriad services to victims of rape and battery and changing the public perception of rape and rape victims. In the late 1970s and 1980s, NOW-N.Y.C.'s employment focus broadened to include career-training workshops and referral services for employers.</p>
            <p>The struggle for passage of the Equal Rights Amendment began in the early 1970s and gained momentum throughout the decade. In the years before the deadline for ratification, the issue took center stage for NOW-N.Y.C., and the ERA Committee reached out to other states to aid in the battles for ratification in state legislatures. In the areas of the arts and the image of women in the media, NOW fought for a dignified representation of women. The group's Image Committee influenced changes in print media advertising, and the Arts Committee called attention to the discrimination against women in the art world. The organization continues its mission of equality for women in New York City. For information on the actions, events, and tactics of the committees, please see the descriptions below each committee heading.</p>

            <p>Photographs, ephemera, artifacts, and audio had been removed from this collection during initial processing and established as the National Organization for Women: New York City Chapter Photographs (PHOTOS 081) and the National Organization for Women: New York City Chapter Oral History Collection (OH 044). Posters had been separated and integrated into the Tamiment/Wagner Poster Collection (GRAPHICS 002) in the subseries US56.2/Women/National Organization for Women. Additionally, audiovisual materials were separated and integrated with the library's film collection. In 2014, these materials were reincorporated into National Organization for Women: New York City Chapter Records (TAM 106). In 2015 2 boxes of photographs and negatives were incoporated into the collection. The accession number associated with this material is NPA 2000.216. 2 boxes of artifacts were also added to the collection in 2015. The accession numbers associated with these materials are NPA 2000.232 and NPA 2001.023.</p>
            <p>In 2014, the archived website was added as series XIV. Also in 2014, approximately 0.25 linear feet of materials discovered in the repository were added to the collection, mostly to Series VI.</p>

            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy be made, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested.

                        <p>Jean Faust served as NOW-N.Y.C.'s first president in 1967. Notable in her papers is information on the action taken against Colgate-Palmolive in 1967 for discrimination in hiring practices--members Flo Kennedy, Jacqui Ceballos, and Kate Millet led a "flush-in" in front of company headquarters in New York, dumping the company's products into a commode on Park Avenue. Also included are files on the 1967 New York State Constitutional Convention, where NOW demanded many legislative changes to promote equality of opportunity in education, employment, and housing. Materials on the actions to desegregate the classified advertisements of the New York Times appear here as well. These files are arranged alphabetically by topic. Materials include announcements, bylaws, correspondence, flyers, mailing lists, meeting notices, print media articles, reports.</p>

                        <p>Elayne Snyder was president of NOW-N.Y.C. in 1974. At that time, NOW-N.Y.C. sponsored a series of programs to celebrate women in the arts, which were held at Town Hall in 1974. Her papers contain materials from most of the committees active at this time period as well as administrative records from the Executive Committee and National NOW as well. Snyder's papers are arranged alphabetically by topic. Materials include announcements, brochures, correspondence, programs, flyers, minutes, and position statements.</p>

                        <p>The papers of Noreen Connell (who was president of NOW-N.Y.C. in 1977-1978) date from the late 1960s and early 1970s, at the inception of the women's movement, and are not limited to NOW. The bulk of her papers include position papers on various topics, such as pregnancy, abortion, and sexuality. Publications from the early women's movement have been separated and are to be catalogued with Tamiment periodicals. There is material on other women's liberation groups, such as Red Stockings and Women's Liberation. These folders are arranged alphabetically by topic (according to Connell's folder titles), and they include correspondence, poems, and position papers.</p>

                    <p>This series covers events and projects by NOW--New York Chapter that do not fall under the jurisdiction of a committee. These events range from the broad, multi-issue "Women Strike for Equality" in 1971 to the narrower-focused "Endowed Chair" project (1973-76) through which NOW named its conference room chairs after renowned women in history. This series is arranged alphabetically by program.</p>

                    <p>This series includes materials from other feminist groups that were NOW's contemporaries in the women's movement. NOW often worked through coalitions, as in the ones organized to sponsor the large demonstrations for reproductive rights. This series is arranged alphabetically by subject; thus, coalitions are located under their subject area (e.g., REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS--WOMEN'S ABORTION ACTION COALITION"). Multi-issue feminist groups like NOW are found under the heading FEMINIST GROUPS.</p>
