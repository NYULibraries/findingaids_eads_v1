    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Richard Berkowitz (b. 1955) is a gay American author, AIDS activist, and former sex worker.  He graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in communications in 1977.  While at Rutgers, he wrote for the campus newspaper, <emph render="italic">The Daily Targum</emph>, and organized the first gay rights protest in New Jersey in 1976.  After graduation, he attended New York University’s (NYU) Graduate School of Film for one year.  He moved to the Chelsea neighborhood of New York and worked as a sex worker, specifically as an S&amp;M dominant, between 1978 and 1982.  </p><p>In the late 1970s, Berkowitz met Dr. Joseph Sonnabend while seeking treatment at the Gay Men’s Health Project clinic in New York City.   In 1982, Berkowitz was diagnosed with AIDS.  In laying out treatment options, Sonnabend shared his multifactorial theory of AIDS, which held that AIDS was caused by repeated exposure to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), in particular cytomegalovirus, and semen.  This theory was in opposition to the more widely held theory at the time that a single, new infectious agent was the cause of AIDS.  Berkowitz felt that gay men needed to know their risk of contracting AIDS and Sonnabend offered to introduce him to another of his patients with AIDS, Michael Callen, who was also interested in spreading this information to the gay community.  Together, the three men are credited with creating the concept of safe sex.  Berkowitz and Callen formed the support group Gay Men with AIDS and began writing about the multifactorial theory, AIDS, and safe sex.  They wrote "We Know Who We Are", a warning to sexually active gay men with AIDS in New York, (published in the <emph render="italic">New York Native</emph> in 1982) and the first safe sex guide, <emph render="italic">How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach</emph>, published in 1983.  They began making television appearances; speaking to support groups, legislators, and others; writing about AIDS; and were founding members of the People with AIDS Coalition.</p><p>Callen died in 1993 from AIDS-related complications.  Sonnabend co-founded the AIDS Medical Foundation in 1983, and continued writing about AIDS issues and serving in private practice until his retirement in 2005.  Berkowitz continued to write about AIDS, safe sex, and gay rights issues throughout the 1980s and into the 2000s.  He returned to sex work in the late 1980s, promoting himself as a safe sex S&amp;M dominant in Florida and New York.  In 2003 he published his autobiography, <emph render="italic">Stayin’ Alive</emph>, and in 2008 was the subject of <emph render="italic">Sex Positive</emph>, a documentary written and directed by Daryl Wein.</p>  </bioghist>

Connolly.  Accretions 2015.421.001 and 2015.421.002 were transferred from Berkowitz’s New York City apartment.

<p>Paper materials were housed in archival folders and boxes.  Audiovisual material with damaged or no housing was housed; all audiovisual material was placed in archival boxes and labeled with unique identifiers.  Floppy disks were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit.  Email was ingested into and arranged in Forensic Toolkit.  Berkowitz’s website was archived to the Internet Archive using the Archive-It service.  Material that belonged together intellectually was brought together physically and duplicate publications were removed.   Items of a sexually explicit nature were identified and will be restricted until two years after Berkowitz’s death.</p>  </processinfo>
