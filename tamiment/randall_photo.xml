            <p>The Harry Randall: 15th International Brigade Photograph Collection represents a substantial portion of the work done by the Photo Unit during the Spanish Civil War. A large body of original negatives and prints was brought to New York from Spain by Harry Randall, who produced additional prints, some of which were distributed to surviving veterans or used in publications. The bulk of the material was left in the Veterans' office, and over the years some of the items were dispersed or lost. Randall and the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade donated the remaining material to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives in July 1999. This collection came to New York University in January 2001 as part of the original acquisition of ALBA collections, formerly housed at Brandeis University.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Funding for the digitization of negatives in this collection was provided by Rickard and Carol-Jeanette Jorgensen, in honor of Harry W. Randall, Jr., head of the 15th International Brigade Photo Unit, and Doreen Randall. </emph></p>

                <emph render="italic">Harry W. Randall, Jr.</emph></p>
            <p>Harry W. Randall, Jr. was born in December 1915 in Spokane, Washington and raised in Portland, Oregon. He was the oldest of three children born to Harry W. Randall, Sr., an insurance adjuster, and Frances E. Randall, a schoolteacher. As a young man he developed an interest in motion pictures and, after graduating from Grant High School in 1934, enrolled in Reed College in Portland. While there he was drawn into a world of political action, joining with other progressive students on campus to support labor causes and to protest the rise of fascism in Europe. He collected food for striking maritime workers in 1934 and distributed leaflets at a lumber-workers strike in 1935. He left Reed after a year, found work as a projectionist for an advertising agency and, with a friend, began distributing foreign films in Washington State and Oregon.</p>
            <p>When the Civil War erupted in Spain Randall enlisted in the International Brigades -- battalions of foreign volunteers that supported the Republican Army -- to fight against Franco's fascist forces. Randall sailed from New York on the S.S. Georgic on June 12, 1937, arriving in Spain on July 1, 1937. Following training with the MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion in Tarazona he was promoted to the rank of Sergeant and became the Chief Photographer of the Photographic Unit of the 15th International Brigade. He served in Spain until the withdrawal of the volunteer forces and returned to the United States on the S.S. Ausonia on December 20, 1938.</p>
            <p>Randall relocated to Canada and found work with the National Film Board of Canada as the head of the Science Film unit. In 1944 he enlisted in the Canadian Army and served in England during the war making newsreels with the Film and Photo Unit. After the war, Randall resumed work with the National Film Board. He returned to New York City in 1952 and for the next 30 years produced, edited, and directed medical films. Randall married Doreen Cavalier, a registered nurse, in 1956 and the couple had two children and settled in Northern New Jersey. In 1983 Randall retired from the American Cancer Society after 18 years as the director of the organisation's film unit.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="italic">15th International Brigade Photographic Unit</emph></p>
            <p>The Photographic Unit of the 15th International Brigade was charged with creating a photographic record of the 15th Brigade for publication in the Brigade's newsletter Volunteer for Liberty, and for distribution to news outlets in the United States, England, and Canada. The photos were intended to boost the morale of the volunteers in Spain and foster sympathy and support for the Republican Army abroad. In addition to Randall, the unit was staffed by photographers Benjamin Katine and Anthony B. Drossel, as well as lab technician William H. Oderaka. The team was given full access to move about the camps, chronicling the troops at rest, and venturing to the front to capture scenes of the battalions in the trenches and under fire.</p>
            <p>As part of their routine, each photographer logged and processed the film he shot. Every photograph was assigned a unique number, which was etched into the negative, and given a caption, which was recorded in one of five logs. Photographs were placed in albums, and copies were distributed to the press. Extra prints were sold to the troops for a nominal fee. Although initially successful in procuring the necessary photographic equipment to carry out their work, as the war progressed lack of film and printing paper hampered the unit's operation. Film development under battle conditions also proved challenging. Like the rest of the Brigade the development lab was a mobile unit, and was required to retreat or advance on short notice. On more than one occasion film and equipment were sacrificed or lost.</p>
            <p>Following the war, Randall returned to the United States and brought with him the Brigade's photographic archives - negatives, albums of prints, and logs. In January of 1939 Randall spent several weeks in the New York Film and Photo League darkroom developing a complete set of fresh prints and making enlargements of all of the photographs taken by the unit in Spain. At the request of the British veterans, Randall also made 8x10 inch prints of images of the British Battalion and sent them along with copy negatives to the veterans' organization in England. In the intervening years the prints, negatives, and logs passed through many hands (most often fellow veterans). In the course of changing stewardship, many prints were dispersed, the original logs separated, and the albums disassembled. This collection represents the most complete record of the Photographic Unit's work in Spain.</p>
            <p>When the Tamiment Library at New York University acquired the ALBA collections in 2001, the Randall collection was inventoried and reassembled. The images were assigned new control numbers (e.g. ALBA PHOTO 11-0001). Although the Photo Unit's handwritten logs have apparently vanished, the images have been matched whenever possible to their captions with the aid of extant typed transcriptions of the original lists. Where no captions were available, a brief description of the image appears in brackets.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Harry Randall: 15th International Brigade Photograph Collection spans the period from August 1937 to September 1938 and contains 1,832 black and white images taken by members of the Photo Unit of the 15th International Brigade during their tour of duty in Spain. The collection is comprised of 1,534 original negatives (ranging in size from 1.1 x 1.5 to 3 x 4.25 inches), and 626 prints (ranging in size from 1.5 x 1 to 8 x 10 inches). Some of the prints came directly from the albums created by the Photo Unit; original numbers and notations are in Randall's hand and the black paper from the photo album still adheres to the back of the prints. The collection also includes 348 copy negatives of which 203 were acquired by ALBA in the 1990s from the International Brigade Archives, housed in the Russian State Archive of Socio-Political History, Moscow. A number of the images are available in more than one format. Consult the collection inventory for details.</p>
            <p>The collection documents the activities of the battalions that made up the 15th International Brigade including the American Lincoln and Washington Battalions (commonly known as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade); the British Battalion; the Canadian MacKenzie-Papineau Battalion; the Dimitroff Battalion (volunteers from Yugoslavia); and the 24th Spanish Battalion (volunteers from Cuba). The images capture the daily life of the volunteers in combat, in the camps, and in the towns, villages, and across the rugged terrain where the Brigade trained and participated in the fighting. In addition, the collection documents political assemblies, congresses, celebrations and the everyday activities of the Spanish populace. Also included are images of visiting dignitaries, journalists and observers including Earl Browder, American military attache Stephen Fuqua, Robert Minor, Ernest Hemingway, Langston Hughes, Meyer Levin and Joseph North.</p>
            <p>Series A: Miscellaneous, August 1937 - May 1938. The 148 images in this series are among the earliest in the collection. Pictured here are scenes from the battles of Quinto and Belchite. Photographs of the aftermath of aerial bombardment offer evidence of damaged factories, homes and churches. Also documented are artillery units and battalions on the move, and troops under fire at Fuentes de Ebro, and soldiers dug into trenches at the Teruel front.</p>
            <p>Series B: Individual Portraits, September 1937 - September 1938. The Unit photographers had hoped to photograph every member the 15th Brigade. Although this formidable task was never realized, the 415 portraits in this series depict prominent members of the Brigade including Political Commissars Joseph Dallet, John Robinson, Saul Wellman, George Watt, Archie Brown, and Chief of the Brigade Commissariat Sandor Voros. Portraits of other Brigade members include Chief of Brigade Staff Robert Merriman, Commander Milton Wolff, Commander 15th Brigade Vladimir Copic, Dr. Mark Straus, 
                <title render="italic">Volunteer for Liberty</title>editor John Tisa, and writers Alvah Bessie and Edwin Rolfe. This series also includes portraits of Photo Unit photographers Ben Katine and Harry Randall.</p>
            <p>Series C: Group Portraits, September 1937 - August 1938, consists of 259 images, which range from double portraits of volunteers casually posing to more formal group photos of entire units. Included here are the Lincoln Washington Machine-Gunner Company, officers of British Anti-Tank Unit, the 15th International Brigade Transmiciones (the unit in charge of communication or transmission); the 24th Spanish Battalion Machine-Gunner Company; the motor cyclists of 15th Brigade; the Lincoln-Washington ambulance and medical personnel; Earl Browder and officers of the 15th International Brigade; Greeks in the Lincoln Battalion; an African-American machine-gunner crew; Doctor Edward Barsky and a medical colleague; Captain Leonard Lamb with Lieutenant William Digges; and five New York University students -- volunteers with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.</p>
            <p>Series D: Miscellaneous, September 1937 - June 1938; August 1938. The 249 images in this series include scenes of the Brigade in battlefields and at rest. Notable images include rustic cane shelters built by the Lincoln Battalion in an olive grove in Almuchel; Fascists taken prisoner at Belchite; the troops on a train from Quinto to Ambite and at a railroad station milling with civilians; soldiers in showers, washing and mending clothes, reading and playing football, and picking olives; peasants weaving; an ambulance from the Teachers Union and American Student Union with Murray Nemeroff driving; the funeral of Lieutenant William Digges at Mollerusa; the Dental Wagon with Dr. Jack Klein at work; School for Commissars at the Ebro Front; and the trial of deserters at Senes.</p>
            <p>Series E: Miscellaneous, January 1938 - September 1938. Many of the 761 images in this series capture the final battles of the International Brigades. The most arresting shots are those taken at the crossing of the Ebro in July 1938. In an article that appeared in the 
                <title render="italic">Volunteer for Liberty</title>in September 1938, Randall described the Photo Unit's activities and the photographic record they created during the Ebro Offensive:</p>
