    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Newspaper Guild of New York (The Newspaper Guild, Local 3) represents journalists, sales staff, and technical workers in the print and online media industry in the New York metropolitan area. Among its members are reporters, photographers, editors, typographers, commercial artists, technicians, accountants, mail-room and circulation staff, independent translators, and staff members of non-profit organizations. The Guild has been active in campaigns to defeat racial and sex discrimination, to promote worker safety, and to provide job security in an industry that experienced rapid automation and other technical and structural changes.</p><p>The Newspaper Guild of New York (NGNY) was chartered in 1933 by a group of journalists led by Heywood Broun, columnist at the <emph render="italic">New York World Telegram</emph>. In December of the same year, representatives of disparate groups of journalists from across the country met in Washington, D.C. and formed the American Newspaper Guild (ANG). The driving forces behind creation of the Guild were Broun and Jonathan Eddy of the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph>, both from the NYNG. There was considerable opposition within the fledgling Guild to operating as a trade union rather than as a professional association. In that internal struggle, the NYNG strongly supported the trade-union model. The bitter <emph render="italic">Newark Ledger</emph> strike of 1934-1935 proved to be a testing ground for conflicting visions of the Guild's role. While the strike settlement yielded little in the way of concrete gains for the strikers, the Guild emerged from it with an enhanced sense of national solidarity and confirmation of its ability to lead and bargain for its members.</p><p>At its founding, the American Newspaper Guild was open only to journalists, broadly defined. However, in 1937 it expanded its jurisdiction to include commercial departments, and added the goals of improved journalistic and ethical standards, and equal employment and advancement opportunities in the newspaper industry to its mission statement. The Guild affiliated with the American Federation of Labor in 1936, but soon abandoned the AFL for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).</p><p>The ensuing years saw increased international expansion as the Canadian region was established in the 1950s. In 1970, the ANG changed its name to The Newspaper Guild (TNG). Against the backdrop of the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement, the Guild and its locals heightened their opposition to race and gender discrimination in news industry hiring and promotion practices during the 1960s and 1970s.</p><p>The charismatic, energetic Broun, whose politics were forged in the Socialist Party, served as president of the New York Guild for its first six years. Early organizing campaigns enjoyed considerable success. In 1935, the <emph render="italic">New York Post</emph> became the first New York newspaper to unionize, followed by the <emph render="italic">Daily News</emph> in 1936, and the <emph render="italic">New York Times</emph> in 1941. The first magazine to unionize was <emph render="italic">Time</emph> in 1937.</p><p>The NGNY has carried out lengthy strikes against several major New York newspapers, including the 16-week <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Eagle</emph> strike of 1937, the 11-week <emph render="italic">World-Telegram and Sun</emph> strike of 1950, and the five-month <emph render="italic">Daily News</emph> strike of 1990-1991.</p><p>In 1995, the The Newspaper Guild merged with Communication Workers of America (CWA), and in 1997 it became a sector of the CWA. As of 2011, TNG-CWA represents 34,000 members. The Newspaper Guild of New York represents employees of major dailies, weeklies, many publications of the City's ethnic communities, magazines and other publications of non-profit organizations such as Consumers Union, and news and data services.</p><p>In spring 2015, the Guild voted to change its name from the Newspaper Guild of New York to the NewsGuild of New York to better represent digital-based news organizations.</p>  </bioghist>

an labor union for people in the news and media business, including print, photo, video, and digital journalists, as well as employees in advertising, circulation and other related areas. They represent about 3,000 employees at New York area-based media organizations and their respective bureaus around the nation. Crawling of the website began in 2009 and presented unit officers, bargaining, negotiations, union elections, layoffs, and contract updates from Guild units, including the Amsterdam News, Consumers Union of United States, Inc., Daily News, El Diario, Foreign Policy, Hudson News Company, Jewish Forward, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, The Nation Enterprises, Newsweek, Norwalk Hour, Reuters, Scholastic, Scientific American, Standard &amp; Poor's, Time Warner Inc., WPIX-TV, WQXR-WQEW, and the Writers Guild of America, East. Unit news dates back as early as 2000. The website also promoted the Employee Free Choice Act.</p><p>In 2010, the website underwent a redesign and focused on bad faith bargaining with Thomson Reuters, events, retirees' chapter, training sessions, scholarships, awards, local and unit news, as well as industry news. In 2011, the website highlighted a petition campaign about New York City budget cuts. In 2012, the website focused on contract dispute with the New York Times. 2013 news focused on negotiations with Kaplan  International Centers and in 2014 negotiations with the Daily Beast. In spring 2015, the Guild voted to change its name from the Newspaper Guild of New York to the NewsGuild of New York to better represent digital-based news organizations and the website was updated to reflect that change and shifted focus on the website to digital newsroom organizing efforts and campaigns. </p><p>In 2017, the website underwent its most recent redesign as of this writing (November 2021). In addition to the unit and industry news, the website contains resources related to awards, competitions for journalists, safety and security, combatting sexual harassment in the workplace, just cause, digital security, membership organizations, blogs and newsletters, journalism ethics, freelancers, scholarship and grants, trainings and tutorials, insurance, diversity, press freedom, preserving work, sources, experts, fixers, and image and information verification. Other organizations later represented by union are Jacobin, Law360, the Roosevelt Institute, Ars Technica, AskMen, BuzzFeed News, Consumer Reports, DailyMailTV, Fortune Magazine. Geek.com, La Opinion, Mashable, Money Magazine, New York Magazine, PC Mag, Pitchfork, People Magazine, Sports Illustrated, Stage 29, The New Republic, The New Yorker, TIME Magazine, Quartz, Insider, Meredith (Shape Magazine, Martha Stewart Living, Entertainment Weekly, PeopleTV), The Markup, Wired, NBC Digital, and the Wirecutter. In 2020-2021, the website contained news coverage, membership updates, vaccine mandates, and other resources related to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_a2c2626fc183fbc96e7e25268f4e8fef"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl.
