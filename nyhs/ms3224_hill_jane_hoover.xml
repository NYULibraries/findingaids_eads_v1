    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Just before their June 1936 marriage, Dr. Eugene Scott Hill gave his fiancée, Jane Steele "Polly" Hoover, the present guestbook, a blank, leather-bound volume embossed "Guests," with the inscription "Realizing that I am the most fortunate man in the world and that your loveliness and charming personality will bring many attractive people to our home, this book may serve as a record of those people and events that you wish to remember. Scott." The earliest entry dates from April 1, 1936. The last, from August 11, 1949. Although the Hills had homes in Canton (1940 census), and Hills and Dales, Stark County, Ohio (1950 census), a number of the entries in Jane's guestbook note a New York City address of 1100 Park Avenue, Manhattan. Some entries are headed with the occasion for the gathering, e.g., "April 20, 1937, Going away party for family at Waldorf" or "Aug. 1938, Party for Dad—going to Europe," and many bear humorous inscriptions from attendees along with their signatures.</p>  </scopecontent>
