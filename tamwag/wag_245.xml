            <p>Evelyn Davis (1906-1982) was born and educated in New York City where she lived throughout her life. Before embarking on an acting career, Davis was a teacher, and later she worked as a model. In 1933 Davis joined the Hall Johnson Choir and appeared in 
                <emph render="italic">Run Little Chillun!</emph>, a lyric drama by Hall Johnson. Her resume includes several Broadway plays: 
                <emph render="italic">Happy Birthday</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">The Wisteria Trees</emph> with Helen Hayes, "
                <emph render="italic">Vicki</emph>" with Jose Ferrer, and "
                <emph render="italic">The Perfect Marriage</emph>" with Miriam Hopkins. Touring productions include 
                <emph render="italic">Macbeth</emph> with Orson Welles and 
                <emph render="italic">The Naked Genius</emph> with Gypsy Lee Rose. Davis continued to be cast in plays throughout the 1950s before venturing into minor roles in television and film. On television Davis appeared in the Omnibus production of 
                <emph render="italic">Uncle Tom's Cabin</emph> and the NBC production of 
                <emph render="italic">The Iron Gate</emph>. Her film credits include small roles in 
                <emph render="italic">Shaft</emph>, "
                <emph render="italic">Nothing but a Man</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Shaft's Big Score</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">Final Cut</emph>.</p>
            <p>Davis was also active in various theatrical organizations: Actors Equity Association (AEA), the American Federation of Television and Radio Actors (AFTRA), the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), and the Negro Actors Guild of America (NAG). Before her health began to fail, Davis was on the NAG-New York Branch Executive Board and also served as its Recording Secretary. In 1969, Davis was a delegate to SAG's Joint Equality Committee, which held a series of discussions on the issue of casting ethnic minorities in television commercials. Davis died on January 30, 1982 at Harlem Hospital in New York City.</p>

            <p>Photographs were separated from this collection during initial processing and were established as a separate collection, the Evelyn Davis Photographs (PHOTOS 215). In 2013, the photograph collection was reincorporated into the Evelyn Davis Papers and Photographs.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Evelyn Davis Papers and Photographs consists of Evelyn Davis’s personal papers and memorabilia. Her extant papers reflect a life-long interest in the history of African-Americans in theater and film. The bulk of the collection is made up of scripts, playbills, and contract agreements from Davis’s appearances in plays and television programs throughout the 1940s, ‘50s, and ‘60s. There are also papers from organizations to which Davis belonged, including a membership card from the Screen Actors Guild, a membership certificate from the Negro Actors Guild of America, and contracts from the Actors’ Equity Association. The collection also contains letters, cards,and telegrams from family and friends, including actors with whom Davis worked. Illuminating Davis’s interests are several collections of Negro spirituals, an essay on racial prejudice by Dr. Juan Rene Betancourt, an issue of Theater Arts entitled “The Negro in the American Theater,” and a booklet, “The Way It Was,” that commemorates African-American actors and actresses. The collection also includes two photograph albums that have been disassembled and one intact photograph album (largely black and white prints for all three), one disassembled scrapbook, and ninety loose black and white photographs ranging in size from 11x14 to 2x3 inches. Included in the photographs are signed headshots from other actors and actresses and stills of theater performances.</p>
