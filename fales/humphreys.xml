                        <p>Gunk was a zine written and compiled by Ramdasha Bikceem. Issue #4 has “Have You Seen Me?” and “What Degenerate Created this Abortion?” on the front cover. The issue primarily addresses themes of music, race, riot grrrl, skateboarding and fanzine culture. Bikceeem discusses people of color in the punk scene, and writes a review of the 1992 Riot Grrrl Convention in Washington D.C. where her band, also called Gunk, played and in which she addresses the lack of diversity among attendees. The issue also contains a letter from Selwyn Harris who created the zine Happyland, an interview with Olga Snodgrass of the fanzine Tales of Blarge, and a list of other zines headed by an Ian Svenonius quote, “I’m sure the CIA keeps files on every fanzine kid in America.” Bikceem also reprints a flyer from Riot Grrrl Press.</p>

                        <p>Leeds and Bradford Riot Grrrl was a zine written and compiled by the riot grrrl group in Leeds, England and Bradford, England. This is a compilation of the first three issues as well as a section entitled “Our Herstory” that provides a history of the Leeds and Bradford Riot Grrrl group. The zine primarily addresses themes of music, misogyny in music, and riot grrrl as a means to confront this misogyny. The zine includes information on Riot Grrrl Press in the United States, and a guide on how to make records, tapes, and CDs. There is also a piece entitled “What NME did not print.” This was written for the journalist Liz Evans to use in an article in NME magazine; Evans, however, did not include the piece and her article on Leeds and Bradford Riot Grrrl - as mentioned in “Our Herstory” - was factually inaccurate.</p>

                        <p>Riot Grrrl Valley was produced in Pioneer Valley in Massachusetts. The contributors were students at the 5 colleges in the region: Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and University of Massachusetts Amherst. Issue #2 is dated March 1992. The zine contains personal writings and poetry on topics of manipulation and sexual assault. There are additional personal writings on street harassment and abusive friendships. Jen from the band Flowerthief writes a piece giving advice to female-led bands on how to respond to misogyny from musicians and music stores. There is also a piece that provides information on yeast infections. The zine ends by listing definitions of the terms Matriarchy, Patriarchy, and Anarchy. Cartoons are dispersed throughout the issue.</p>
                        <p>Issue #3 of Riot Grrrl Valley begins with a piece called “My Babies,” which discusses childcare and ends by calling for “Childcare Not Warfare.” Other writings focus on women being told to smile, and an advice piece by Jessica on “10 Ways To Sleep Like A Baby.” There is a call out from Jenna at Hampshire College looking for women and men to contribute to a cassette and zine compilation on topics of, but not limited to, sexism and gender oppression. The zine contains an advert for an upcoming show featuring the bands Bikini Kill, Flowerthief, Bad Dreamhouse, and Tsunami. The zine ends with a call for submissions.</p>
