    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>New York University's first recorded efforts regarding sustainability was with the establishment of the sutdent group, EarthMatters in 1982. The university's first recycling program was developed in 1990. NYU's precursor to the Office of Sustainability was first established in 2006, as the Sustainability Task Force. In 2018 it became the Office of Sustainability and hired its first Chief Sustainability officer, Cecil Scheib. The first Climate Action Plan was released in 2009. Over the years, NYU has committed to carbon reduction goals and challenges, built and renovated green buildings, launched bike share and green grants programs and internships, and received sustainability awards and certifications. From April 17-21 2023, NYU held a weeklong initiative highlighting the university's efforts to be climate neutral by 2040.</p>  </bioghist>
