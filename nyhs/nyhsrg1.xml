            <p>From its founding in 1804 until late 1937, when a corporate governance structure with a Board of Trustees was established, the New-York Historical Society (N-YHS) was governed by its general membership. Although N-YHS’s Constitution and By-Laws were revised many times, for over one hundred years, until 1917, regular meetings of the members were required to be held at least quarterly. Special meetings were also often called. At these meetings, in addition to hearing presentations on historical and other topics or conducting a special event, business matters were considered by the members present, such as accepting new members, considering major purchases, accepting donations, establishing collection access policies, and overseeing activities related to the collections and other aspects of the organization. At the January meeting of each year, the members held their annual election for officers, who served one year terms, and named members to the standing committees.</p>
            <p>Although the general membership deliberated and voted on business matters at their meetings, many matters were referred to either standing or ad hoc committees for consideration and for reporting back to the membership. Of the standing committees, the most longstanding and ultimately most important was the Executive Committee. Created in November 1842, the Executive Committee lasted for the next ninety years, until it was replaced by the newly formed Board of Trustees in the organizational restructuring of November 1937. Over its lifetime, an increasing degree of responsibility was placed with the Executive Committee. By the 1890s, all standing committees existed as subcommittees of the Executive, including the Committees on Finance, Papers (called Lectures, beginning 1913), Library, Publications, Anniversary, Building, Fine Arts, and Membership (after 1917).</p>
            <p>Standing committees other than the Executive existed at various times during the nineteenth century. In some instances, the Constitution and By-Laws were amended to specifically require the named committee. One of these was the Committee on Fine Arts, which was formed in March 1856 for the purpose of expanding N-YHS's holdings in that regard; the committee lasted until May 1895 when it was deleted from the N-YHS governing documents and replaced by a sub-committee of the Executive Committee. Various committees related to buildings, including fundraising and construction oversight, were formed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A Field Exploration Committee, headed by William L. Calver, existed from 1918 to 1937 for the purpose of conducting archaeological digs and other field research. N-YHS’s founding Constitution included a so-called Standing Committee, elected by the members, to solicit donations and develop plans for N-YHS’s operations; this committee lasted until 1829. In 1817, various committees, including one on mineralogy, were formed as N-YHS expanded its collecting focus.</p>
            <p>In addition to standing committees, through the nineteenth century, and especially in the earliest decades, ad hoc, or short term, committees of two or more members would be formed at the member meetings for the purpose of pursuing various specific initiatives. These initiatives included, among other things, making arrangements for a given year’s anniversary celebration speaker, negotiating for available manuscript collections, overseeing production of a publication or building construction, or auditing the Treasurer’s accounts. Over time, the Executive Committee absorbed these functions, but in any case it was the membership that conducted these affairs. Indeed, into the early decades of the twentieth century, N-YHS had less than ten staff members, most of whom were responsible for library support, facilities maintenance, or clerical work. Much of the managerial level work was carried out by the elected officers, especially by the Librarian, who acted as something of a chief operating officer and was responsible for N-YHS’s entire range of collections and activities.</p>
            <p>Despite the growing importance of the Executive Committee, until 1917 much business was still brought to the regular member meetings for discussion and final resolution. In 1917, N-YHS’s Constitution and By-Laws were amended to place virtually all governance and management powers with the Executive Committee, which comprised all N-YHS officers and twelve other members named by the President. The general membership’s role in business matters was consequently reduced, mostly to electing officers. This role, too, had been reduced. Prior to 1914, these elections were held annually, at the regular January meeting; beginning with the 1914 election, the terms of office were extended to three years. Consequently, with a 3-year election cycle and the Executive Committee's increased authority in place, regular membership business meetings were held only every three years after 1917. This cycle lasted until the governance changes of 1937, which ended the participation, however limited in practical effect, of the members in the management of the Society and converted the Executive Committee into an independent Board of Trustees.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
            <p>The New-York Historical Society management committee records group (NYHS-RG 1) includes records associated with the organization’s governance structure of 1804-1937. The record group includes ten volumes of minute books from the meetings of the Society’s members (1804-1937) and twenty volumes of minute books from the Executive Committee (1842-1937). The final volume of the Executive Committee minutes also includes the minutes for the 1938 meetings of the newly-formed Board of Trustees. The record group also holds the minute books for three other committees: the Standing Committee (1806-1822, with gaps), the Mineralogical Committee (1818-1819), and the Committee on Fine Arts (1856-1880). The Standing Committee book includes mostly lists of donations to N-YHS for many of these early years.</p>
            <p>The record group also includes so-called “official papers” (1804-1938). Most of these papers are preparatory material for the Society and Executive Committee meetings, preliminary notes and drafts of meeting minutes, or supporting or source materials concerning matters presented at the meetings, such as correspondence, reports, invoices, nominations of new members, and so forth. Taken together, the minute books and the supporting official papers form the framework of the basic narrative of the history of N-YHS to 1938.</p>

Other record groups that are processed and available to researchers and are especially related to the New-York Historical Society management committee records (NYHS-RG 1) are as follows:</p>
            <p>Although this management committee record group holds reports and includes references in the minute books to the work of the various buildings committees active in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to 1938, most material on the subject of building construction, including several standalone committee minute books, will be found in the New-York Historical Society original buildings planning &amp; construction records (NYHS-RG 3).</p>
            <p>For the early to mid-nineteenth century records, there is not a consistently sharp distinction between the content of the official papers and of the correspondence files that were maintained by N-YHS. Accordingly, researchers should also see New-York Historical Society general correspondence (NYHS-RG 2).</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                    <p>The Society Meeting Minutes series includes the ten bound volumes of minutes recorded at the regular and special meetings of N-YHS members from its founding meeting on November 20, 1804, to the last of these meetings on November 16, 1937. Although there is a degree of consistency in the content of the meeting entries over the years, there are also many differences. Some of these differences are likely clerical in nature, such as the tendencies or thoroughness of the various recording secretaries. Some differences relate to the changing scope of the matters brought for consideration and vote to the Society meetings; by the early twentieth century, most business matters were handled within the Executive Committee (see Series II). After the constitutional amendments of 1917, only a few matters other than officer elections are documented in the minutes. Accordingly, the following scope notes relate principally to the meeting minutes from 1804 to 1917.</p>
                    <p>Routine content includes lists of individuals nominated and accepted for membership; obituaries/memorials for recently-deceased members and nationally-known figures; annual elections of officers; meeting attendees; and appointments of temporary committees to consider various specific matters.</p>
                    <p>Donations of items are recorded inconsistently. For the period from the 1820s to 1841, there are frequent detailed lists of accessions. There are references to donations before and after that period as well but, especially after 1841, other books are noted as holding this information (see the New-York Historical Society collection accession registers record group (NYHS-RG 15)). The minutes record many initiatives aimed at expanding the collection of manuscripts, artifacts, and artwork. These include successful matters, such as the acquisition of art from the New York Gallery of Fine Arts in 1857, and unfruitful ones, such as the offer from Mathew Brady of his Civil War photographs in 1866.</p>
                    <p>Operational matters, including finances, leasing space in the early-mid 1800s, acquiring land and constructing buildings in the mid-1800s and in the 1900s, setting open hours for the rooms, and proposing constitutional and by-law amendments are recorded in the minutes. Financial matters from N-YHS’s earliest years are not always recorded in any particular detail, but the amount of this information expands in later years to account for various funds, investments held, and other matters. N-YHS’s financial struggles of the 1820s and 1830s, and their eventual resolution, are well-documented in the minutes.</p>
                    <p>Reports from committees are sometimes written into the minutes in full, as is some important correspondence. These reports include those of the various buildings committees created over time. References can also be found to the ultimately unsuccessful initiative of the 1860s-1870s to locate N-YHS within Central Park (see New-York Historical Society original buildings planning &amp; construction records (NYHS-RG 3) for much more on this topic).</p>
                    <p>The minutes also record to some extent the educational and social activities of N-YHS. These include noting those invited to read papers to the members and the subject of those papers; decisions to publish certain material; and summaries of anniversary celebrations and other special events, sometimes noting the toasts at the event.</p>

                    <p>In some volumes, loose documents, such as the slates of nominated candidates for N-YHS officers, were found during processing.

                    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                    <p>The Executive Committee Meeting Minutes series includes the twenty bound volumes of minutes recorded at the meetings of the committee from April 1843 to the last of its meetings in 1937. The series also includes the 1938 minutes of the committee’s successor governing body, the Board of Trustees; the 1938 minutes are bound in the same volume as the 1936-1937 committee minutes.</p>
                    <p>Matters routinely considered by the Executive Committee and recorded in the minutes include the recommendation for election of individuals nominated for membership; consideration of publishing initiatives; vetting speakers and papers to be presented at Society meetings; review of finances and banking arrangements, including the performance of mortgages held for investment; approval of library hours and other operational matters; assessment of the condition of the collections, including the Abbott Egyptian collection, which is discussed extensively in 1916; compilation of member lists; consideration of acquisitions by purchase or by donation; approval of the payments of bills (which are listed in the minutes until sometime in the 1920s); maintenance of the buildings; permissions to photograph objects; and proposals of changes to the N-YHS Constitution and By-laws. In addition to its broad scope, the Executive Committee also worked closely with the Fine Arts Committee and the buildings committees so references to their activities are found in these minutes also. In short, the full range of management matters was conducted by the committee and is reflected in the minutes.</p>

                    <head>Arrangement Note</head>
                    <p>The series is arranged in chronological order, in 20 bound volumes. The first twelve volumes were bound in new covers in July 1936 by the New-York Historical Society. The final volume was bound in April 1943. The other eight volumes remain in their original covers, which are somewhat deteriorated.</p>
                    <p>In some volumes, loose documents, such as lists of standing committees, were found during processing. These were removed from the volumes and placed in a separate folder and box, which is noted in the container list below. The point in the volume from which the documents were removed is noted in the folder with the documents.</p>

                    <p>The Other Committee Minutes series includes the following three volumes:</p>
                    <p>The first volume holds minutes recorded by the Standing Committee and lists of early donations to N-YHS. The Standing Committee existed from 1805 until 1829 when the requirement for it was removed from the N-YHS Constitution and By-Laws. The volume does not include records from this entire period. Only four meetings of the Standing Committee are recorded; one of these (1807) was adjourned for lack of a quorum and the other three (1806, 1809, 1810) include only a small number of committee resolutions, one of which concerns the possible purchase of items from John Pintard. The bulk of the entries in the volume are lists of donations of books and other objects (1806 to 1818, with gaps, and 1822); these entries often, though not always, also indicate the donor.</p>
                    <p>The second volume holds minutes of the Mineralogical Committee, dating from 1818-1819. Although the committee was formed in October 1816 and existed until perhaps circa 1920 (the Society meeting minutes are silent on when the committee was discharged), this slender volume holds the brief minutes for only two meetings: December 28, 1818, and March 6, 1819. The minutes also include a letter from the committee’s secretary indicating his unavailability for a March 26, 1819 meeting.</p>
                    <p>The third volume holds minutes of the Committee on Fine Arts, dating from its formation in March 1856 to March 1880. Although the committee existed until May 1895, there are no entries after March 1880. The minutes refer to the committee’s support for collecting photographs, consideration of the Jarvis collection, the Audubon watercolors, the Bryan collection, the possibility of acquiring space for N-YHS in Central Park, and Mathew Brady’s offer of photographs to N-YHS, among other matters.</p>

                    <p>The three volumes are listed here chronologically by their earliest entry. Within each volume, the entries proceed chronologically.</p>
                    <p>The bound pages of the Mineralogical Committee volume include only the December 1818 meeting minutes. The other content is on two loose sheets that were inserted into the volume. These two sheets were removed to a separate folder, which is noted in the container list below.</p>
                    <p>The Standing Committee and Fine Arts Committee volumes were bound in new covers in July 1936 by the New-York Historical Society. The Mineralogical Committee volume is in its original binding and covers.</p>
                    <p>A photocopy of the Standing Committee book is available for general access use. The photocopy is complete as to the book’s bound pages, but does not include two loose sheets that are with the committee book. It also cuts off a small amount of information and is difficult to read at points because of the poor reproduction quality. Accordingly the photocopy cannot be relied on as a replacement for the original, but it is preferable to use over the somewhat fragile original for users initially surveying the document for potential usefulness.</p>

                    <p>The Official Papers series, which is the original name of the files, primarily includes material that directly relates to the Society membership and Executive Committee meetings and minute books (see Series I and II). Most of the documents are preparatory material for the meetings, preliminary notes and drafts of meeting minutes, or supporting or source materials concerning matters presented at the meetings. Much of the material in this series is likely also found recorded in the minute books or in print form, but that may not be true in all instances and these documents are typically the draft or manuscript versions which can have a research value separate from the final versions.</p>
                    <p>For each year’s files from the 1840s to the 1910s, the overall content is fairly consistent. The files for these years primarily include documentation of proposed new members; drafts or manuscripts of the Librarian and Executive Committee’s annual reports; drafts of statements and resolutions, including memorial remarks for recently deceased members; and documentation of the annual nomination and election of officers. The membership documentation is especially extensive and includes the original correspondence, paper slips, business cards, or standardized forms nominating candidates as members; the extract from the minutes recording the nominations, which were forwarded to the Executive Committee for its consideration; and the communication from the committee recommending acceptance of the nominees.</p>
                    <p>Also commonly found in the files of the 1840s to 1910s, though less consistently than the above materials, are remarks made by newly-elected presidents, reports of various committees formed on an ad hoc basis for particular purposes, and some financial and donation information. Some legal documents are in the series, including the agreement by which N-YHS acquired the collection of the New York Gallery of Fine Arts. Documentation related to the funding and construction of buildings for N-YHS is found in the years 1840s-1850s, and again in the 1880s-early 1900s. References to the publications program and its funding and to various special events are found here also. The container list below includes notes at the folder level to highlight at least some of the noteworthy items identified during processing.</p>
                    <p>The series includes a set of files dating from 1899-1905 that were maintained by Sydney H. Carney, Jr., N-YHS's Recording Secretary for much of this period. Carney was also a member of the Central Park West Building Committee during this period and was that committee’s secretary in some years. The most substantive portions of Carney's files relate to the building project, especially in regard to controversy over the architect's unanticipated need to change the building design. These documents include correspondence from architects York &amp; Sawyer and others; draft resolutions; drafts of Carney's outgoing correspondence to the architects, to N-YHS presidents Eugene and Samuel Hoffman, and to others; notes taken about telephone calls; draft committee minutes; a subscription book; and other documents related to the project. Carney's files also include correspondence related to his Recording Secretary responsibilities, including requests from Librarian Robert H. Kelby for signatures on meeting extracts, member certificates, and Publication Fund shares and share transfers; requests for resolutions to be drafted; notices from officers and committee members of meetings they would be unable to attend; and other such routine business matters.</p>
                    <p>Subsequent to the 1910s, for the files of the 1920s and 1930s, the scope of the documentation narrows, with little material related to the monthly Executive Committee minutes. Much of the routine matter for these years includes the manuscript Annual Reports (Librarian, Executive Committee, and Field Exploration Committee) and lists of approved new members and of deaths (“necrology”). The bulk of the documents for these years relate to the triennial officer elections, the by-law changes of 1917 and 1937, and the special membership meeting called in 1936 to approve the Executive Committee’s decision to initiate construction of the Central Park West building expansion. Proxy voting was introduced with the 1917 elections and much of the bulk of the material for the 1920s and 1930s includes the proxy certificates and the recordkeeping concerning them. Nonetheless, the contentious elections of 1917 and 1920, driven by charges of mismanagement by Mrs. Van Rensselaer, are well-documented here with correspondence, circulars, meeting transcripts, and competing ballots.</p>
                    <p>For consistency with the Executive Committee minutes series, the Official Papers series includes the year 1938, the first year that N-YHS was governed by a Board of Trustees, newly-constituted under the by-law changes of 1937.</p>
                    <p>The earliest files in this series, from prior to the 1840s, are much more uneven in content and are of a different character than the later files. The bulk of the documents for these first three decades of N-YHS’s history are invoices, receipts, and account statements, such as those related to purchases of books, moving the library to and setting up the rooms at the New York Institution and other places, creating the mineralogy cabinet, printing circulars and publishing advertisements, and other expenses. Files in the late 1820s are especially rich with regard to N-YHS’s efforts to resolve its debts. This material concerns the claims of John Pintard and John Francis for purchases they made for N-YHS, and the releases obtained from various creditors. Other than financial matters, the early files contain some of N-YHS’s early circulars to the public, meeting agendas and extracts, and librarian and committee reports.</p>

                    <head>Arrangement Note</head>
                    <p>The series is arranged in chronological order, which appears to have been the original order of the files. The files advance in yearly increments, except for the files from N-YHS's earliest decades, which were somewhat disorganized and included multiple years.</p>
                    <p>Within each year, the documents are also generally arranged in chronological order. Many documents though are undated; these were typically left in the folders in which they were found on the assumption they were filed with the correct year. These undated documents are found at the end of each year.</p>
                    <p>Most years include the manuscript drafts of the annual reports of the Executive Committee and the Librarian. These reports were prepared for the January membership meeting and summarized the activities of the prior year. The original filing of these reports was inconsistent across the series and could not be reliably rationalized during processing, especially since some are undated and unclear as to which year they refer. Accordingly, the annual report drafts were left in the files in which they were found. For the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a year's report will typically be found in the following year's file. From about 1920 through the end of the series in 1938, the report will be found with its subject year.</p>
                    <p>Much of the material in the earliest years (1805-circa 1850) are invoices and other financial documents. Payment delays were common so the bills for a prior year are often found in the following year. Also, many of these financial documents are account statements that refer to past transactions of prior years.</p>
                    <p>Folders labeled with just a date or date range include standard subject matter as described in the Scope and Contents Note. Some individual documents were identified as specifically noteworthy and were referenced in a note at the folder level.

                    <p>While there is a fairly clear distinction between the two, there does seem to be instances in which documents that could be considered official papers were placed by N-YHS officers in the General Correspondence Files (NYHS-RG 2), and vice versa, particularly for the nineteenth century records. For example, correspondence read to the Society or a committee and "laid upon the table" or acted on, or a resignation letter by an officer, is more likely to be with correspondence than the official papers. Although some of these documents were moved between the official papers and correspondence during processing, for the most part items were left as found, and researchers may wish to check both record groups for a given year.</p>

                    <p>The official papers were processed perhaps circa 2000, with documents transferred from original folders to archival containers. In 2015, project archivist Larry Weimer refined the arrangement, principally by sorting documents within each year into the meeting or topic they related to, created the inventory and other descriptive notes, and organized it as a series within the management committee record group.</p>
