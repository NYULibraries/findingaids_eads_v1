            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Elizabeth Robins (1862-1952) was an actress, playwright, prolific novelist and suffragist. American born and educated, Robins spent most of her adult life living and working in England, first in London and later in London and Sussex. The nearly one hundred linear feet of materials which comprise the Elizabeth Robins Papers reflect the many facets of Robins' life. The collection includes diaries, photographs, scrapbooks and ephemera, as well as correspondence with a variety of dynamic personalities, and is a resource not only for studying her life and works, but for examining a wide range of family, social, and political issues. The collection provides insight into American and English theater in the late 19th century, English literary circles, and the women's suffrage and feminist movements in England and America, as well as information on gold mining camps in post Civil War Colorado and turn of the century Alaska. Largely because of her long term friendship with Dr. Octavia Wilberforce, there is information on the movement for improved health care for women and children. The correspondence of Raymond Robins, Elizabeth Robins' brother, adds another dimension to the collection. His letters are an excellent source for the study of Chicago political history, the Settlement House Movement, and Progressive Party politics.</abstract>

            <head>Provenance</head>
            <p>In 1964, New York University Library purchased the papers (1803-1963) of Elizabeth Robins (1862-1952), actress, playwright, novelist, and suffragist. When Robins died in 1952, her longtime friend Octavia Wilberforce gained possession of the papers which now make up the collection. Upon Wilberforce's death, Leonard Woolf became the Literary Executor and it was through him that New York University's library arranged to purchase the collection from the Chicago firm of Hamill and Barker.</p>
            <p>Some G. B. Shaw letters were viewed by Dan. H. Laurence in England after NYU purchased the collection, but before it was shipped to NYC. Laurence included these in his: Laurence, Dan H. (1965). Bernard Shaw: Collected Letters, 1874–1897. London &amp; Beccles: William Clowes &amp; Sons, Ltd. Not all of the letters were in the collection when it was processed by the library. See the collection folders for details.</p>

            <p>Elizabeth Robins (1862-1952) was an actress, playwright, prolific novelist and suffragist. American born and educated, Robins spent most of her adult life living and working in England, first in London and later in London and Sussex.</p>
            <p>Robins, born in Louisville, Kentucky, was the first child of Charles E. Robins and Hannah M. (Crow) Robins.[l] Her parents had six other children, two of whom died in infancy. Her sister Eunice (Una) died in 1886, at age twenty. Of her three brothers, Saxton (1869-1901), Vernon (1872-1934) and Raymond (1873 1954), Robins was closest to Raymond, as their lifelong correspondence testifies.</p>
            <p>Jane H. Robins, Elizabeth Robins's paternal grandmother, helped to rear most of the Robins children. Charles E. Robins was often away from his family pursuing a variety of business ventures and Hannah Robins spent much of her time with relatives in Louisville, Kentucky. Well into their adult years, Elizabeth and Raymond Robins recalled staying in Jane H. Robins's "Old Stone House" in Zanesville, Ohio. [For more information on the Robins family background, see the description for Series Three: Robins Family Papers.]</p>
            <p>After 1880, Robins moved to New York City and began an acting career. She became a member of the Boston Museum Company, James O'Neill's Monte Cristo Traveling Company, and toured with Edwin Booth Lawrence Barrett. She appeared in such plays as A Celebrated Case, Julius Caesar, and The Merchant of Venice, first under the stage name Claire Raymond and later as Bessie Robins.</p>
            <p>While a member of the Boston Museum Company, Robins met and married George Richmond Parks, another actor in the company. The 1885 marriage did not last long. Two years after the wedding, Parks committed suicide by jumping into the Charles River at the stroke of midnight, using a suit of theatrical armor to weigh himself down. Elizabeth Robins never remarried.</p>
            <p>In 1888, Robins traveled abroad on a journey which included a stop in England. While she retained her American citizenship and made frequent visits to America, she adopted England as her permanent residence.</p>
            <p>In England Robins established herself as a serious actress. She played a number of roles, such as Claire de Cintre in Henry James's The American, but by the 1890's she had discovered the plays of Ibsen and English audiences had discovered her. She became best known as an Ibsen actress, appearing as Hedda in Hedda Gabler, Rebecca West in Rosmersholm, Nora in A Doll's House, and, her most famous part, Hilda Wangel in The Master Builder.</p>
            <p>Robins's interest in non-conventional theater led to her involvement in producing plays. She found the actor-manager system confining because it did not allow her to choose her own roles; controversial plays received little support from the powerful actor-managers. In the early 1890's, therefore, she joined forces with Marion Lea, another actress interested in Ibsen's plays, to produce Hedda Gabler.</p>
            <p>Hedda Gabler was the first of many plays Robins was influential in bringing to the English stage. In 1896 she organized the Ibsen-Echegaray subscription series to raise money for the productions of Little Eyolf and Jose Echegaray's Mariana.</p>
            <p>The following year William Archer (1856-1924) joined her in forming the New Century Theatre to sponsor non-profit productions. Although short-lived, the New Century produced several plays including John Gabriel Borkman, Admiral Guinea, and Peer Gynt.</p>
            <p>During the 1890's, while Robins was active in English theater, she began a new career as a writer. Under the pseudonym C.B. Raimond, she saw four of her novels published by 1898. She also collaborated with her friend Florence Bell (1851-1930) on the play Alan's Wife, published anonymously in 1893. After the publication of one of her most successful novels, The Open Question (1898), Robins's identity as C.E. Raimond became widely known. [See Appendix I for a list of Robins's published books.]</p>
            <p>In 1900 Robins went to Alaska in search of her brother Raymond, who, a few years earlier, had joined the gold rush in the Klondyke. Worried about her brother's safety, she convinced William T. Stead, publisher of the Review of Reviews, to finance her trip with the agreement that she would write articles for him about her travels. Although she was only in Alaska briefly, the journey was an important event in her life. In addition to convincing Raymond Robins to leave Alaska (which she believed saved his life), she wrote two novels, The Magnetic North (1904) and Come and Find Me (1908), and several short stories based on her experiences.</p>
            <p>In November 1902 Robins made her final appearance as an actress in Mrs. Humphry Ward's Eleanor at the Court Theatre. Thereafter she devoted more time to writing and to her growing interest in issues of women's equality.</p>
            <p>In 1907 a new play by Robins, Votes for Women, opened in London. Shortly after, her novelization of it, The Convert (1907), was published. During this time, she joined the Women's Social and Political Union and, in 1907, became a committee member of that organization. According to her diary entries for the years 1907-1911, Emmeline and Sylvia Pankhurst visited Robins on occasion and discussed policies for the campaign. Robins was also involved with the Actresses' Franchise League and served as vice president for the Women Writers' Suffrage League. She wrote many articles in support of women's suffrage, including "Why" (1910) and "A Defense of Militant Suffrage" (1913). The 1913 publication of Way Stations brought together a collection of her articles and speeches about suffrage.</p>
            <p>In 1908 Robins met Octavia Wilberforce (1888-1963), who became her lifelong companion. Wilberforce studied medicine and became a doctor with special interest in health matters relating to women and children. She worked at the New Sussex Hospital for Women and Children, where Robins served on the Board of Management. In 1927 Robins, with Wilberforce and Dr. Marjorie Hubert, converted her country home, Backsettown, into a restplace for overworked women. She arranged for Backsettown to remain as a place of recuperation after her death. The facility is still in operation today.</p>
            <p>Robins's interest in feminism continued throughout the 1920's. In 1924 she published Ancilla's Share, a collection of essays on sexism which also addressed the problem of racism and the possibilities for pacifism. During this period, she served on the Board of Directors of Time and Tide, a magazine begun by Viscountess Rhondda (Margaret Haig Mackworth) for and about women, and became involved with The Six Point Group.</p>
            <p>During World War I, Robins performed Emergency Corps relief work, served as Honorary Librarian at the Military Hospital in London, and lectured to school children in Sussex. She spoke for the Ministry of Food in England and Ireland and was involved with the Henfield Women's Institute in Sussex, which she later served as honorary president.</p>
            <p>Robins spent most of the period during World War II in the United States. The Vassar Alumni House in New York, the Princeton Inn in New Jersey, and the Prince George Hotel in New York City were several of her residences during the war.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Robins died in England on May 8, 1952, in her ninetieth year.</p>

            <p>The nearly one hundred linear feet of materials which comprise the Elizabeth Robins Papers, 1803-1963, in New York University's Fales Library reflect the many facets of Robins' full life. Robins retained family papers predating her birth as well as her own correspondence with a variety of dynamic personalities. Her papers, therefore, are a resource not only for studying her life and works, but for examining a wide range of family, social, and political issues. The early papers, a slice of Americana, are valuable for studying family, religious, and educational history. Dating from 1803, the Robins family papers consist of diaries, correspondence, compositions, poetry, and photographs. Also present is information on gold mining camps in post Civil War Colorado and turn of the century Alaska, as Robins, her father, and two of her brothers all spent time in mining camps.</p>
            <p>The papers from Elizabeth Robins' lifetime provide insight into American and English theater in the late 19th century, English literary circles, and the women's suffrage and feminist movements in England and America. Largely because of her long-term friendship with Dr. Octavia Wilberforce, there is information on the movement for improved health care for women and children.</p>
            <p>The correspondence of Raymond Robins, Elizabeth Robins' brother, adds another dimension to the collection. His letters are an excellent source for the study of Chicago political history, the Settlement House Movement, and Progressive Party politics.</p>
            <p>The thirteen series which comprise the Papers of Elizabeth Robins are measured in linear feet and inches. Each series has a descriptive note and a container list. Oversize materials are cross referenced from their originating series, and listed in an "Oversize Materials" series at the end of the container list.</p>

                    <p>The materials in Series I cover the years 1873-1952, all but the earliest years of Elizabeth Robins's long life. Most of Robins's diaries record daily life at home, but she also wrote several volumes while traveling. Notable among these are her 1880 ""Summit, Rocky Mountains"" diary, kept while visiting her father at the Little Annie Gold Mining Company, Summit, Colorado; her 1900 diary from her journey to the Klondyke to find her brother Raymond Robins, who had gone in search of gold; and her 1905-1906 Chinsegut diary, written during a visit to Raymond Robins and Margaret Dreier Robins in Florida.</p>
                    <p>These diaries are also important for tracing Robins's involvement in the women's suffrage movement. They record her involvement with the movement, especially with the Pankhursts and the WSPU. Of particular interest is a lengthy entry in which Robins describes October 10, 1912 meeting which would cause the Pethick-Lawrences to split away from the Pankhursts.</p>
                    <p>Robins often used her diaries as sources for her literary works, as evidenced by some of the annotations in the volumes. She also wrote about the books she was working on, so the diaries show some of the questions she was grappling with concerning the characters and plots of her works.</p>

                        <p>This subseries consists of Robins's diaries from the time she was fourteen years old (1876) to the last year of her life (1952). This subseries is remarkably complete with the exception of the 1890's.</p>
                        <p>Robins did not always write lengthy diary entries, but she wrote often, which allows one to piece together many of her activities over the years. Sometimes she would skip days of writing in her diaries, then compensate for those periods by filling in the blank pages from memory.</p>

                        <p>Subseries A contains letters from childhood friends, relatives, family friends, actors, actresses and admirers. There are also letters from Dr. Andrew McLaughlin of the Oak Lawn Retreat for the Insane in Jacksonville, Illinois where Robins's mother, Hannah Crow Robins, was committed for several years.</p>
                        <p>Robins and her husband, George Richmond Parks, traveled separately in their work, and many letters from Parks to Robins survive. The letters begin during their courtship in 1884 and end with Parks's suicide note in 1887. Folder 47 contains Parks's record book in which he recorded his theatrical engagements (date, place, play, part) for the years 1877-1886. Folder 44 includes newspaper clippings about his suicide.</p>
                        <p>Elizabeth Robins moved to England in May of 1888 and created an entirely new life for herself. She continued to correspond with her family but lost contact with most of her friends and acquaintances from her early years. The letters of the few American friends and relatives who continued to write after 1887, including Lloyd Tevis, president of Wells Fargo and a maternal cousin of Robins's, who sponsored her early acting career, can be found in Subseries B. Some letters to and from childhood friends can be found in two letterbooks, which date from 1878-1881. The majority of these refer to Robins's four-month stay in the Rocky Mountains during her eighteenth summer. [See also Series Three: Robins Family Papers.]</p>

                    <p>Series III is a collection of papers that enable one to study the close and intricate network of family relationships that formed Elizabeth Robins's earliest environment, and many of them have annotations in Robins's hand. It provides interesting case studies of the family, education (especially of women), religion, and business enterprise in the nineteenth century. The Robins family also served as models for plots and characters in Elizabeth Robins's novels, e.g. The Open Question (published in 1898), "Rocky Mountain Journal", and "Theodora, or The Pilgrimage". There is abundant information, covering a century and a half, on the history of an American family. Raymond Robins's letters can be found in Series IV: Raymond Robins and Margaret Dreier Robins.</p>
                    <p>Subseries A-G are arranged chronologically. Correspondence with Elizabeth Robins is at the beginning of each subseries, followed by General Correspondence, Business Correspondence and/or personal items such as notebooks, essays, etc. Correspondence is arranged alphabetically; diaries and letterpress books by chronology. The extreme diversity of material in this series complicates uniform arrangement and description.</p>

                        <p>Subseries A consists of the papers, mainly correspondence, of Jane Hussey Robins (JHR). JHR was Robin’s paternal grandmother, and appears to have been the dominant female influence on the young Elizabeth Robins; in Robins's words, her "touchstone." Robins would later dedicate an edition of The Open Question to her.</p>

                        <p>Subseries B consists of the papers of Charles Ephraim Robins (1832-1893), and makes up the bulk of Series III. CER was an entrepreneur, a scientist, and politico-religionist. He also wrote and lectured on social issues such as prohibition. CER's papers include extensive business correspondence, which documents his ventures in real estate, insurance, banking, manufacturing, and assaying. In 1875, CER went to the territory of Colorado as an assayer for the Little Annie Gold Mining Company. His office was located at Summit in Rio Grande County, from which he also observed and reported on weather conditions for the United States Army. In 1880 Robins visited him at Summit, just as she would later visit her brothers on the gold fields of Alaska in 1900. CER wrote to his family about the West, religion, God, women's rights, landscapes, the family, and events of the day.</p>
                        <p>Subseries B also contains consistent runs of indexed letterpress books (outgoing) and letterbooks (incoming), in addition to 25 volumes of CER's personal diary.</p>

                        <p>Subseries C consists of the papers of Sarah E. Robins (1836-1869), an aunt of Elizabeth Robins. ER felt great kinship with her aunt, Sarah Elizabeth Robins, a poet, and noted on Sarah Robins's correspondence many similarities between their personalities. Sarah Robins appears to have been a role-model for Robins, particularly because of her interests in literature and education. [See the letters of Gorham D. Abbot.] This subseries also contains a letter from Charles Dickens and two letters from Edgar Allan Poe which Sarah Helen Whitman sent to Sarah Robins.</p>

                        <p>Subseries D consists of the papers of Elizabeth Robins’s mother, Hannah Crow Robins (1836-1901). Hannah spent much of her married life with her Crow relations in Louisville, Kentucky, particularly with the Bodines. After the family moved back to Ohio from Staten Island, New York, some of her children were raised in Louisville; Elizabeth Robins usually stayed in Zanesville, Ohio, with her grandmother, Jane Hussey Robins. In 1885, Hannah Robins was committed to an asylum. In addition to correspondence, Subseries D contains Hannah Robins's diary for the year in which Elizabeth Robins was born.</p>

                    <p>Series IV spans the years 1887-1951 and contains materials related to Raymon Robins and his wife Margaret Dreier Robins. This series consists mainly of correspondence, some newspaper clippings, and texts of speeches and is arranged into four subseries. Subseries A-C are arranged chronologically.</p>
                    <p>Raymond Robins (1873-1954), Elizabeth Robins's youngest brother, was a lawyer, social worker, lecturer and politician. He led an active life in which he became passionately involved in a wide variety of progressive causes. In 1905 he married Margaret Dreier (1868-1945), an active member of the Women's Trade Union League. Margaret Dreier Robins served as President of the National Women's Trade Union League from 1907-1922. She also spoke in favor of women's suffrage and, like Raymond Robins, became involved in Progressive Party politics and, in the 1920's, the movement to outlaw war.</p>

                        <p>Subseries A contains the correspondence of Raymond Robins and Margaret Dreier Robins as well as occasional letters from Elizabeth Robins to Raymond Robins. Raymond Robins wrote faithfully to ER for most of their lives. His letters describe his social and political activism as well as his opinions of American politics and politicians. They also address family matters and reminisce about childhood experiences. Raymond Robins's interest in settlement work and the problems of the homeless is expressed in letters he wrote while involved with Chicago Commons and the Northwest University Settlement. A few typescripts of his speeches are filed at the end of Subseries A.</p>
                        <p>Raymond Robins also occasionally sent Elizabeth Robins letters he received and considered noteworthy. One example of this practice is the 1901 letter from Jane Addams about Abraham Isaak. On the back of this letter is a note written by Isaak, while it prison, to Robins written from prison (See Box 1, Folder 2).</p>

                        <p>Margaret Dreier Robins's correspondence begins in 1905, the year she married Raymond Robins, and continues regularly until 1924. Thereafter, her letters appear sporadically from 1932-1945. Margaret Dreier Robins only occasionally wrote to ER about the progress of American suffragists and her impressions of Chicago politics. Her letters deal mainly with the beauty and workings of the Chinsegut Hill property in Florida and her husband’s health. Subseries B also contains one folder of letters from Margaret Dreier Robins to Raymond Robins that are primarily love letters.</p>

                    <p>Series V contains materials relating to Florence Eveleen Eleanor (Olliffe) Bell (1851 - 1930), a playwright and author, who met Elizabeth Robins around 1891 while Robins was active in the British theater. Bell and Robins formed a close friendship which remained strong and constant until Bell's death in 1930. In her will, Florence Bell stipulated that all of Elizabeth Robins's letters should be returned to her.</p>
                    <p>The letters sent by Robins to Bell comprise the majority of this series and are personal in nature. The correspondence concerns domestic problems; news of friends; the illnesses which Robins suffered throughout her life; her travels in Europe and North America, including her journey to Alaska in 1900 which inspired the novel The Magnetic North (1904), and her frequent visits to her brother Raymond at his home, Chinsegut, in Florida; family members; Robins's relationships with David Scott, Octavia Wilberforce and Marjorie Hubert, all of whom lived at her Sussex County home, Backsettown. The personal quality of this correspondence offers a special insight into Robins's development throughout her middle years. Noticeably absent from the correspondence is commentary on Robins's involvement in the suffrage movement.</p>

                    <p>Series VIII reflects Elizabeth Robins's interest in non-profit theater and Ibsen dramas. With the exception of the acting contracts dating from 1883, when Robins was living in America, and a prompt copy for The King's Pleasure, the materials in this series relate to her theater experiences in England. In addition, there is material relating to the production of Votes for Women!, Robins's suffrage play, published in 1907.</p>

                        <p>Subseries A contains business records from the period when Robins produced and/or acted in such Ibsen plays as Hedda Gabler (1891, 1898), The Master Builder (1893), and Little Eyolf (1896). There are also business accounts and seating charts for the 1897 production of Echegaray's Mariana, which she directed. Some of these plays were produced by the New Century Theatre, which Robins, William Archer, and others formed.</p>

                        <p>Subseries F is made up of two albums of photographs taken at Chinsegut, the Hernando County, Florida estate where Elizabeth Robins' brother, Raymond, lived. This subseries includes many candid photographs of Margaret Dreier Robins and her sister, Mary Dreier, both of whom were active in the women's movement in the United States. The reconstruction of the main house is well documented, as are the crops, flora and fauna of Chinsegut. This subseries contains a fine collection of photographs of the black servants who worked for the Robinses, providing a chronicle of their domestic and work experiences in rural Florida during the first quarter of this century.</p>

                        <p>Subseries C includes playbills and announcements of performances, material on the New Century Theatre and publications, i.e. plays, reviews and articles. Theatrical posters have been moved to Mapcase 2.A. Playbills and announcements of Elizabeth Robins' performances are arranged alphabetically by the name of the play. There are also playbills and announcements from other performances, many with annotations that show Elizabeth Robins attended them.
