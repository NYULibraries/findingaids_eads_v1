    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Working Class Movement Library was formed out of the personal library collection of Edmund and Ruth Frow at their home at 111 King's Road, Stretford, England in the 1950s. In the 1980s, the Salford City Council agreed to support the library and the collection was moved to Jubilee House on Salford Crescent. The collection focuses on the history of Britain's working class from the beginning of industrialization to the present day, as well as materials on left campaigns, the Spanish Civil War, and the Communist Party of Great Britain.</p>  </bioghist>
