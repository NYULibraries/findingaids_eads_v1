    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Biographical information provided by Antonina Vivirito's grandniece, Regina Discenza.

Antonina Theresa Vivirito was born on September 29, 1920. She lived in Bay Ridge until stricken with Alzheimer's in 1998. Her parish was St. Michael's. She attended grade school there. The family home at 330 50th Street was purchased in November 1918, before she was born, although there is a different address on her birth certificate. She held various jobs after high school, never married and had no children, so her grandniece eventually became her legal guardian. At one time she took a Civil Service exam and became a Clerk at the NYC Board of Education at 65 Court Street. She retired from the BOE in 1991. She was known as "Anna" or "Ann" and passed away in October 2006.</p>  </bioghist>
