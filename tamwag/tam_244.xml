            <p>The Revolutionary Workers Headquarters (RWH) was a U.S. Marxist-Leninist-Maoist organization that formed out of a split from the Revolutionary Communist Party in 1977. Two years after the death of Mao Zedong, the majority of the Revolutionary Communist Party, led by Bob Avakian, felt that the Chinese government had adopted revisionist policies, while the minority, which supported the then current regime of the Community Party of China (CCP), established the RWH. Subsequently, RWH merged with the Bay Area Communist Union, the League of Revolutionary Struggle, and other organizations to from the Committee to Unite Marxist-Leninists. The RWH was active in the labor movement, struggles of oppressed nationalities, the women's movement, the student movement, and the struggle for divestiture from companies doing business in apartheid South Africa. It was directly involved with founding of the Progressive Student Network.</p>
