            <p>This collection contains the family papers of Joseph North and Helen Oken North from the 1920s to the 1970s. The materials in this collection primarily consist of correspondence between Joseph and Helen North, from the 1930s to 1970s. The collection also contains a significant amount of material from Helen’s family including correspondence of her father and mother Morris and Jennie Oken, and her sisters Lydia Oken Mates and Mary Oken Wilson.</p>
            <p>Joseph and Helen North's papers document several major themes in their lives including their careers, political activism, economic struggles, and children. A small amount of correspondence relates to their time in Spain during the Spanish Civil War where Joseph worked as a foreign correspondent for the communist publication the 
                <emph render="italic">New Masses</emph> and Helen worked in the medical service. The collection also contains correspondence and materials related to Joseph's work as a journalist, both before and after Spain. Their papers also contain correspondence from friends and family and materials related to their three children. Correspondence between Helen and her sisters is exceptionally rich and provides an intimate look into their personal lives touching on a wide array of topics including their jobs, political beliefs, relationships, family planning and contraception, children, and care of their aging parents.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the collection contains materials that relate to the life of Helen’s parents Morris and Jennie Oken. Helen's parents immigrated to the United States from Russia in the early 20th century and her father Morris was active in a number of labor and socialist organization in New York City. While the collection contains a large amount of material related to communism and political activism, it also contains an account of family life across three generations. The collection also contains a significant amount of materials related to Helen's sister Lydia and her husband Dave Mates. Lydia Oken Mates worked for many years as a communist party organizer in Detroit and Dave Mates was a Veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigades who was also involved in communist party activism throughout his life.</p>
            <p>Other materials contained in this collection include clippings, flyers, and ephemera, a small number of negatives, and two artifacts: a hat taken from a Moorish soldier who fell in Spain, and a tsarist-era naval uniform cap from Russia.</p>
            <p>Many of the correspondents in this collection are addressed by a variety of names throughout their correspondence. Helen and her family often address each other by their Russian names or variations of those names. In much of her correspondence Helen is often addressed as Vezl, Vezlenka, Honushinka, Annunshinka, or Anne. Joseph North, who was born Jacob Soifer, is also addressed as Jacob or Jake on many occasions, and in several instances his letters are addressed to Jacob Sofier. Helen’s sister Lydia is often addressed as Lidushka, Liducinka, or Lilian, her sister Mary is addressed as Manya or Maninka; her father Morris is frequently referred to as Mitaya, and her mother Jennie, whose name is often spelled Jenny, is often referred to as Jenja.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Joseph North was born Jacob Soifer in Ukraine to Jessie Soifer and Balia Yasnitz in in 1904. The family immigrated to the United States when he was 9 months old and settled in Pennsylvania. Joseph North began working in a Pennsylvania textile mill at the age of 12, and later worked summers in the ship yards of his hometown. Joseph graduated with a B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania and worked for several years after his graduation as a reporter for a variety of Pennsylvania newspapers. In 1935 he was one of the founders of the weekly 
                <emph render="italic">New Masses</emph> and served as its editor for 15 years. Joseph North also served as a communist party organizer and a correspondent for the 
                <emph render="italic">Daily Worker</emph>. Through his work as a journalist he reported on a number of major events including labor strikes of the 1930s, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II.</p>
            <p>Helen Oken North was born in the Bronx, New York in 1912 to Russian immigrants Morris and Jennie Oken. Helen Oken was the youngest of five siblings, two sisters and two brothers. Her older brother Semyon was her mother’s son from a previous marriage who eventually left to live with his father, and her brother Yaksha, born in 1906, died when he was only year old after contracting an illness during the family’s passage to the United States. Helen and her two older sisters Mary and Lydia were born in New York and maintained close ties throughout their lives. The Oken family was highly involved in labor and socialist organizations. Helen's father Morris Oken was a textile worker and was active in the Workmen's Circle as well as other labor organizations. Helen was also involved in union activity and worked a labor organizer as a teenager. She later worked as a Communist party organizer in Pennsylvania in the 1930s. Helen’s sisters Lydia was also highly involved in political activism and worked as a Communist Party organizer in Detroit and Chicago. She married Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteer Dave Mates in 1930.</p>
            <p>Helen Oken married Joseph North in 1931. Joseph worked as a correspondent for the 
                <emph render="italic">New Masses</emph> in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Helen accompanied him to Spain and worked in the medical service during those years. Helen and Joseph later settled in Manhattan and had three children Daniel, Susan, and Nora. Helen continued to be involved in Communist Party activism. She also assumed the role of breadwinner on many occasions, as Joseph’s work as a journalist did not provide enough to support a family and often required him to travel abroad. Helen and Joseph were married for 26 year, but eventually divorced in 1957. Helen married Communist Party of the United States leader Gil Green in 1970. Joseph North also remarried, marrying 
                <emph render="italic">Daily World</emph> journalist and editor Augusta Strong in 1963. Joseph's wife Augusta died in early 1976 and Joseph died in December of that same year. Helen North died in 1990.</p>
