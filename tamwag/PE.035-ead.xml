The collection consists of printed ephemera such as event fliers, brochures, leaflets, pamphlets and other publications, covering the years when SDS was under the auspices of the League for Industrial Democracy in the early 1960s through the 1970s. Major actions of SDS are represented in the collection, including their first official national convention at Port Huron, Michigan and the resulting political manifesto known as the "Port Huron Statement" as well as the March on Washington in April of 1965 opposing the Vietnam War. Also included in the collection are materials from various local and regional SDS chapters from around the country, most notable are New York University, Columbia University and other New York schools, Queens College, City College of New York, City University of New York, Brooklyn College, and Stony Brook University.

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was a radical student group born from the Student League for Industrial Democracy (SLID), which was the student branch of the League for Industrial Democracy (LID), a social democratic organization. The group was expelled from the LID in 1965 and gained national prominence in the late 1960s as the Students for Democratic Society.</p>
            <p>In 1962, SDS held its first national convention in Port Huron, Michigan and it was there that they adopted the eponymous "Port Huron Statement" as their political manifesto. The manifesto was drafted by Tom Hayden, but convention members helped craft it into its final form. While not pro-Soviet Union, SDS did not take an anti-communist approach in their organizing activities. This issue led to the trouble with the League for Industrial Democracy and the eventual split. The group organized around numerous issues, including, opposing the Vietnam War, the draft, and participatory democracy. In April 1965, SDS organized the March on Washington opposing the war in Vietnam, which drew tens of thousands of people and situated SDS nationally as one of the primary organizations of the New Left. Organizing around civil rights issues, SDS was inspired by the work of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. SDS was primarily a campus organization, but began to spread to more community oriented projects like the Economic Research and Action Project and Chicago JOIN projects.</p>
            <p>During 1968, SDS experienced increased factionalism involving Progressive Labor (PL) members and the RYM I group who advocated a more student-oriented, militant, counter-cultural program. The June 1968 SDS National Convention was full of discord. PL supporters gained policy victories that stressed attempts to gain working-class support, but RYM I and other non-committed delegates continued to dominate the organization's leadership positions. SDS persevered and remained in the center of student protests like the Columbia University strike in the spring of 1968 and the activities at the Democratic National Convention that summer in Chicago.</p>
            <p>After being at the forefront of the New Left during the 1960s, internal pressures surfaced again at the June 1969 National Convention. SDS split into three factions: PL, Weathermen, and RYM II. This latter group, composed of diverse, moderate SDSers, collapsed within a year due to its inability to develop a coherent activist program. The Weathermen, who included many of the national leaders and staff members, sought to initiate an immediate revolution; within six months, the organization had gone underground and its leaders were wanted in connection with mob violence and bombing. SDS-PL continues today as an off-shoot of the Progressive Labor Party.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) Printed Ephemera Collection consists of a selection of printed matter, including: event fliers, pamphlets, brochures, newsletters, bulletins and other publications as well as constitutions, position papers, convention materials, and circular letters.</p>
            <p>Series I: National and Chapter Files, 1959-1986, contains printed material published by the organization nationally while based out of San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston. There are fliers for regional conferences, meetings, film screenings, sit-ins, teach-ins and strikes as well as for more well known events like the 1965 March on Washington against the war in Vietnam. This series contains several files of pamphlets and publications. These are arranged first chronologically and then alphabetically based on either prominent subject or author. The authors are primarily past presidents, vice-presidents or executive secretaries. In addition to the printed matter that was put out nationally, material, if identified, is organized under local chapter or region; there are files from Amherst College, Harvard/Radcliff, Columbia University, New York University, Brooklyn College, Queens College, Stanford University, Yale University and the Madison, Wisconsin Branch, as well as the New England and New York Regionals. This series contains a few subject files that contain publications, pamphlets, fliers, and circular letters; these subject files are on major activities of SDS: anti-draft and anti-Vietnam War organizing, women's liberation and the organizations' joint civil rights work with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). The splits that occurred within SDS at the 1969 National Convention in Chicago involving Progressive Labor and the Revolutionary Youth Movement II are documented in this series. Also, a number of different projects sponsored by SDS are included in this series as well, these include: Chicago JOIN, the Economic Research and Action Project (ERAP), the Liberal Study Group, the Peace Research and Education Project, and the Worker Student Alliance. As the SDS was affiliated with the League for Industrial Democracy in the early 1960s, there are memoranda and correspondence from this period.</p>
            <p>Series II: Radical Education Project Publications (Ann Arbor and Detroit, MI; San Francisco, CA), 1963-1970, consists of the pamphlets and publications put out the Radical Education Project, a project of the SDS. The pamphlets are generally published out of Ann Arbor, but occasional out of Detroit. This series contains one file of material from the Bay Area Radical Education Project, based out of San Francisco, CA. The pamphlets and publications are arranged by subject. This series also contains literature lists, circular letters and memoranda, reports and proposals and brief introductions to the Radical Education Project in the form of brochures and pamphlets.</p>
