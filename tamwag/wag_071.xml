Technical Staff, Local 3882, founded in 1978, is a labor union that represents over 1500 clerical, administrative, and technical staff at New York University. The original website for the union was found at http://www.aft3882.org/ and consisted of news from the union, events, education survey, their contract, officers and stewards, electionvolunteer opportunities, benefits, benefit archievements won by the union, training opportunities, and their newsletter Momentum. It also includes member alerts on the EEOC suit and National Labor Relations Board complaint against NYU. In 2011, UCATS began negotiation a new contract and launched a blog at http://ucats3882.blogspot.com/ to document contract negotiations. The main website focused on assisting workers that were laid off or bumped, as well as a contract ratification toolkit, strategic timeline, and tentative contract agreement summary and recommendation from the executive council. The contract was ratified in 2012. The blog also featured posts on a No Confidence vote against NYU President John Sexton and opposition to the NYU 2031 expansion plan. </p><p>From 2015-2018 there was a gap in collecting and during that time a new website was launched, http://ucats3882.org/. The new website documented the contract bargaining in 2017, photographs and videos from rallies, member benefits, their current contract, issues of Momentum, volunteer opportunities in the union, and their bulletin board. The bulletin board features information on debt management, health insurance, executive council elections, retirement, pay raises, Black lives matter support, NLRB notices, and COVID-19 pandemic updates. </p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_4ea08ba132fbf897b2c02074b3e27cc9"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl.
