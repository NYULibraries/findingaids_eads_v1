    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Harold Maxson Holloway was born on January 11, 1907 in Cedar County, Iowa to Albert Holloway and Nannie Maxon.  He was the second of three children.  He attended the University of Iowa and the University of Alabama, where he received degrees in Library Science and Journalism.  He also received a Rockefeller Foundation Internship from 1936-1937, and attended some graduate level classes at New York University.</p><p>Holloway was employed as the director of Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts in Montgomery, Alabama (1931-1936); as a part-time employee of the Museum for the Arts of Decoration at the Cooper Union in New York City (1937-1938); as a curator at the New-York Historical Society (1938-1947); director and one of the founders of the Saginaw Museum in Saginaw, Michigan (1947-1949, 1956); the director of the Chicago Historical Society (1949-1956); and director of the Rensselaer County Historical Society in Troy, New York (1957-1966).</p><p>In 1942, while employed at the New-York Historical Society, Holloway enlisted in the United States Navy Reserve in a response to the outbreak of World War II.  He was stationed at Guantanamo Bay and on the USS Potawatomi. He received an honorable discharge in 1945 at the rank of Lieutenant (junior grade).  After being discharged from the United States Navy Reserve, Holloway returned to the New-York Historical Society, and continued to work in multiple positions within the museum curation field for many years, while also traveling extensively in both the United States and Europe.</p><p>In 1956, Holloway suffered from a heart attack, after which he was demoted from his position at the Chicago Historical Society, and had trouble finding new work.  Though he did eventually find new employment at the Rensselaer County Historical Society, Holloway suffered from ill health for the rest of his life.  He died on August 12, 1966 of prostate cancer.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>This collection follows the professional career of H. Maxson Holloway, including his ongoing search for employment as a museum curator.  It consists primarily of professional correspondence, letters to family and friends, and receipts, news clippings and other ephemera.  It also documents Holloway's military service in the United States Navy Reserve during World War II.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the collection is the way it documents the job hunting process in the 1930s through the 1950s.  This collection includes a substantial number of letters between Holloway and the numerous museums he contacted throughout the United States regarding employment.  Because Holloway saved both correspondence addressed to him and carbon copies of typewritten letters that he sent out, the collection offers a rare and complete picture of job hunting conventions for the time period.</p><p>Other correspondence describes travel plans and experiences, family matters, deaths of friends and family, and gossip within the museum community.  </p><p>Holloway was a curator for the New-York Historical Society from 1938 to 1947, with a leave of absence during his World War II service.  The collection includes a number of letters to and from employees of N-YHS both during and after his employment at the institution, generally about personal rather than business matters.</p><p>There is also one box of documents from Holloway's time serving in the United States Navy Reserve during World War II. Materials include news and magazine articles, ephemera, photographs, correspondence, and official military papers.</p>  </scopecontent>
