            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>Brooklyn has had a lively history as an entertainment outlet, particularly through its active theater scene during the gas-light days of the 18th and 19th centuries. Audiences were enthralled by the performances of such actors and actresses as Maude Adams, the first actress to portray Peter Pan, in 
                <emph render="italic">The Pretty Sister of Jose</emph>, and Sir Henry Irving, the first noted English actor to have been granted knighthood in 1895, in 
                <emph render="italic">The Amber Heart</emph>. These materials document the dynamic venues that working-class and middle class Brooklynites alike attended on a weekly basis, from the Manhattan Beach Amusement Park in Coney Island for musical comedies to the infamous Conway's Brooklyn Theater, which, on December 5 of 1876, went down in flames due to the dangers posed by overcrowding, combustible materials, raucous audiences, and inadequate escape exits. This event later spurred local legislation to regulate theater design, incorporating it into city building codes in 1885.</p>
            <p>Many of these playbills and programs were kept by patrons as theater souvenirs and cover a variety of genres, including early musicals, traditional vaudeville shows, comedies, revues, and English dramas.</p>

            <p>The Brooklyn theater collection is comprised of playscripts, playbills, programs, and other ephemera from various theater venues in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Although some material dates from the early 18th century to as late as the 1930s, most of the material focuses on the years 1823 to 1911. Programs relating to concerts, musical comedies, and musical revues are also included. In addition, the collection has some early rare examples of handwritten director's promptbooks dating back to 1733. Some examples of ephemeral material contained in the collection are an invitation to a ball sponsored by the Academy of Brooklyn to the Prince of Wales, Brooklyn Academy ticket statements, and clippings.</p>
            <p>The collection has been arranged into two series:</p>
            <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
                <item>Playscripts and printed plays, 1733-1896</item>
                <item>Playbills, programs, and ephemera, 1796-1939</item>
            </list>
            <p>The majority of the collection centers on Brooklyn and Manhattan theater venues. Such well-known establishments as the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Montauk Theatre, Orpheum Theatre, Payton's Lee Avenue Theatre, the Lyceum Hall, the Astor Place Opera House, Barnum's American Museum, Franklin Theatre, and Laura Keen's Theatre are included in this collection.</p>

Included are playbills and programs from a number of Brooklyn and Manhattan theaters that seem to have been amassed by patrons as souvenirs.

Also included is one copy of the April 4, 1891 issue of 
                        <emph render="italic">The Theatre Goer</emph>, a weekly news publication containing programs and listings of music and drama performances in Brooklyn and the New York City area.</p>
