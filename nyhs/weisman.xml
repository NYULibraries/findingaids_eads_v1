    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Architectural historian and professor Dr. Winston R. Weisman, born February 3, 1909 in New York City, compiled extensive pictorial documentation to support several areas of his research: cast-iron architecture, origins of the skyscraper, and commercial architecture in New York City, including the Soho district, Rockefeller Center, and buildings by architect George B. Post. His interest in these particular areas of research date from his 1939 dissertation on Rockefeller Center. He did most of his subsequent research as professor and head of the Department of Art History at the Pennsylvania State University, where he specialized in the history of commercial architecture. He dedicated 22 years to teaching at Penn State from 1958 to 1971.</p><p>Weisman was educated at Ohio State University where he received his B.A. in art history (cum laude) and journalism in 1932. He completed his M.A. in art history at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University in 1936. Weisman then received his Ph. D. in art history and studio art from Ohio State University with his dissertation on the genesis of Rockefeller Center.</p><p>His research focused on commercial architecture and shaped his academic career, as he often taught classes on the specific subjects he was researching, whether the early history of skyscrapers or cast iron buildings. He did, though, explore other areas of art history, writing two manuals: <title type="simple" render="italic">Medieval Manuscripts Painting A Teaching Manual</title>and <title type="simple" render="italic">An Annotated Portfolio of Photographs Taken from Medieval Manuscripts</title>in the Pierpont Morgan Library, both published in 1949. These two books reflect his developing scholarly interests before he focused exclusively on commercial architecture.</p><p>Weisman was director of the College Art Association of American Society of Architectural Historians. He published articles in magazines such as <title type="simple" render="italic">The Architectural Review</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Journal of the American Institute of Architects</title>, and the <title type="simple" render="italic">New York Times Sunday Magazine</title>. He contributed the paper, "The History of the Skyscraper 1907 -- 1917," for the Columbia University Symposium on Modern Architecture in May 1966, then spent the last decades of his life working on and researching the unpublished <title type="simple" render="italic">A History of Commercial Architecture Volume 1: The Elevator Building</title>. This volume was a compendium of all of research and articles on the early skyscraper in various American cities, though predominantly New York. Weisman's essay "A New Vision of Skyscraper History" was one of four specially commissioned for a book, <title type="simple" render="italic">The Rise of American Architecture</title>, published as part of the 100th Anniversary celebration of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p><p>Two significant projects marked the final years of Weisman's professional career. For the first "Project Soho" in 1970 and 1971, his students recorded a series of thoroughly detailed photos and data sheets documenting the cast iron buildings in Soho. This project continued work that Weisman had begun in the early 1950s. Weisman's historical efforts helped form the basis for the New York City Landmark Commission's final designation report making the Soho Cast-Iron Historical District an official landmark on August 14, 1973. </p><p>His second major project was overseeing the dismantling of the Laing Stores in the Soho District of New York City, an historical ironclad structure that was the complete building by James Bogardus standing at the time it was scheduled to be dismantled in the late sixties. In April of 1970, Dr. Weisman was named consultant to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.</p><p>He died on October 9, 1997 at the age of eighty-eight.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Cast iron played a preeminent role in the architectural development of New York City and the United States during the 19th century. Cast iron is an alloy with a high carbon content (at least 1.7% and usually 3.0 to 3.7%) that makes it more resistant to corrosion than either wrought iron or steel. In addition to carbon, cast iron contains varying amounts of silicon, sulfur, manganese, and phosphorus. While molten, cast iron is easily poured into molds, making it possible to create nearly unlimited decorative and structural forms. Unlike wrought iron and steel, cast iron is too hard and brittle to be shaped by hammering, rolling, or pressing. However, it is more rigid and more resistant to buckling than other forms of iron. </p><p>In the second half of the 19th century, the United States experienced an era of tremendous economic and territorial growth. The use of iron in commercial and public buildings spread rapidly, and hundreds of iron-fronted buildings were erected in cities across the country from 1849 to the early 1900s, especially in New York City. By the turn of the century, steel was becoming available nationally, and was structurally more versatile and cost competitive. Its increased use was one reason why building with cast iron diminished after intensive use for a half century. A large proportion of iron fronts nationwide have been demolished in downtown redevelopment projects, especially since World War II.</p><p>James Bogardus (1800-1874) was a major proponent of the use of cast iron, and several of the buildings he designed are represented within this collection. In 1849 Bogardus erected the first structure with self supporting, multistoried exterior walls of iron. The Edgar Laing Stores was a row of small four-story warehouses that appeared as one building, and was constructed in lower Manhattan in only two months. Its rear, side, and interior walls were of brick; the floor framing consisted of timber joists and girders. One of the cast iron walls was load bearing, supporting the wood floor joists. The innovation was its two street facades of self-supporting cast iron, consisting of multiples of only a few pieces: Doric-style engaged columns, panels, sills, and plates, along with some applied ornaments. Each component of the facades had been cast individually in a sand mold by a foundry, machined smooth, tested for fit, and finally trundled on horse-drawn drays to the building site. There they were hoisted into position, then bolted together and fastened to the conventional structure of timber and brick with iron spikes and staps.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Winston Weisman Collection of Architectural Photographs spans the period from circa 1950 to 1973 and primarily depicts structures during the period circa 1850 to 1950. There are approximately 3,500 prints (8 x 10 in. and smaller) and approximately 3,800 film negatives (4 x 5 in. and smaller). The prints in this collection are accompanied by building reports, lectures, articles, maps and a six-box card file. Photographs and data sheets from the Soho Project are filed alphabetically by street name and have cross-indexing available by architect and building dates. Mounted prints are filed by street address, city, or country, whichever is most appropriate. The card file provides information about many buildings, arranged by date or place.</p><p>In addition to photographing extant buildings, Weisman reproduced architectural drawings and book and magazine illustrations depicting structures in the 1800s and early 1900s. The collection's most unique section documents cast-iron structures in the Soho area of lower Manhattan in 1971 through notebooks of photographs and building reports created by Pennsylvania State University students under Weisman's direction. In the largest series, mounted photographs depict commercial buildings in Manhattan (including many in Soho), Chicago, Philadelphia, and a few other United States and foreign cities, chiefly from 1850 to 1950. Weisman captioned many of the photographs with information about architect and building construction dates. There is a large amount of duplication of print copies throughout the various series. The first series of mounted copy prints is the best place to search for any particular image as it is the largest group and, to a large extent but not entirely, has many of the images to be found in the other series. The other important series for specific buildings in Soho or this cast iron area in general is Project Soho and its data sheets. The collection is divided into eleven series: Mounted Copy Prints; Negatives; Card Files; Project Soho; Laing Stores Project; Manhattan Buildings Research; Lectures and Writings; Specific Architects Material; Assorted Unmounted Copy Prints; Oversize Copy Prints; 35 mm. Negatives. </p>  </scopecontent>

This series contains approximately 3,500 black and white photographic copy prints, 8 x 10 inches mounted on boards. They depict commercial buildings throughout New York City and its SoHo district, as well as other cities across America, ranging from Albany, Boston, and Chicago to Philadelphia, and also including several foreign cities. All buildings in Manhattan are named, if known, and only significantly represented buildings in other cities are named.</p><p>The mounted prints consist of copy prints of buildings that were used by Winston Weisman in his lectures and research. Many of the prints in this series are taken from books, such as <title type="simple" render="italic">King's Handbook of New York City</title> and <title type="simple" render="italic">Baxter's View: Panorama and Business Directory of Philadelphia: 1856</title> by D.W.C. Baxter, or from architecture magazines from the period 1850s to the early 20th century. These prints contain material relating to an extensive pictorial documentation to support several areas of Weisman's research, such as that commissioned by Pennsylvania State University -- National Science Foundation "Project Soho", and The New York City Landmark Preservation Commission in the early 1970's in addition to his earlier work on commercial architecture, particularly early skyscrapers and cast iron buildings.</p><p>Of particular note are those cast iron buildings represented beyond the Soho district. Weisman sought out print copies of buildings by James Bogardus whose cast iron works were the earliest and most influential. The Eccentric Mill Works had a complete metal frame, including prefabricated columns, beams and wall panels. It was completed in 1849 at the corner of Duane and Centre streets and disassembled ten years later to widen Duane Street. The most elaborate Bogardus building was Harper and Brothers on Franklin Square in 1854 (razed in 1920). It was not a complete cast iron building like the Eccentric Mill Works as it used masonry in the façade and load bearing walls. Bogardus showed his imagination in the girders he designed for Harper. The girders he provided were of cast iron shaped like arches, with rods along the bottom of wrought iron, a far more elastic material, to correct the problem of cast iron cracking at the bottom due to their crystalline and brittle structure. Soon the wrought-iron rolling mills were turning out full-sized structural members. Bogardus had anticipated the use of extra-strength steels in parts of modern buildings. His second cast iron front building, after the Laing Stores represented in the fifth series in this collection, was a significant leap in terms of size and complexity. Begun in April 1850 by Bogardus, with architect Robert Hatfield, the five-story Sun newspaper building in Baltimore was both cast iron fronted and cast iron framed. Other significant buildings by Bogardus among the mounted copy prints are the watchtower at Mount Morris Park, the John Mihau Drugstore, the McCullough Shot Tower, Charles Ahrenfeldt &amp; Son Building, and the lighthouse at Santo Domingo.</p><p>There is a mounted copy print of a representation from a magazine of the first electric passenger elevator, which was installed in the Demarest Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City in 1889 by the Otis Company. This print is among the several images of early elevators, an important element studied by Weisman in looking at early skyscrapers, which he often referred to as "elevator buildings".</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_1495679cd084e6fb9403ee2458a97aa6"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is subdivided into four subseries: Manhattan, Architects, United States, and International Cities.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref15_hgi" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>MANHATTAN, NEW YORK</unittitle></did><arrangement id="aspace_faa88c4d0fb3793decdccf06c9186268"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>The first subseries is print copies of buildings in Manhattan arranged alphabetically by the address of named streets (such as Broadway or Canal Street), followed by numerical arrangements for the avenues (e.g. Fifth Avenue), and then for the numbered street (e.g. 14th Street). Before each address (such as Broadway or 13th Street) are the buildings that do not have a specific numbered address or are situated on a corner with no predominate numbered address. These are arranged alphabetically or numerically by cross streets. These latter buildings form a much smaller part of the subseries as most of the Manhattan buildings have a specific street address. The end of this subseries includes the miscellaneous identified buildings with no address at all, arranged alphabetically by the name of the building, followed by the unidentified buildings of Manhattan, as well as Soho specifically. The Manhattan subseries is rounded out with copy prints of New York City bridges, panoramic views of Lower Manhattan, maps of Lower Manhattan and Soho, and representations of early elevators in Manhattan buildings.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref16_wi5" level="file"><did><unittitle>13 Astor Place</unittitle><container id="aspace_8ccca6f8501788ce712733bfa399314c" label="Mixed Materials"

They contain much the same images as the mounted copy prints, with only a few exceptions, notably Rockefeller Center images, used by Dr. Weisman for his dissertation and subsequent lectures and articles on the genesis of Rockefeller Center. These images include those of Rockefeller Center original designs and models when it was to be Metropolitan Square, housing three tall office buildings and a new Metropolitan Opera House around a plaza. The fall of the stock market ended these particular plans after the Opera could no longer afford to move.</p><p>Series II is arranged according to Weisman's own arrangement and reflects his particular interest in the area.

George Post (1837 -- 1913) was an important figure in the development of the skyscraper and a particular point of interest for Weisman as Post used innovative building techniques to create ever-taller buildings and large interior spaces for public use. Significant buildings of George Post within the collection are St. Paul's Building, Produce Exchange, Cotton Exchange, Union Trust Building, Mortimer Building, Equitable Building, Dry Dock Savings Bank, Mills Building, and the Western Union Building, among many others.

Most of these cards are of a bibliographic nature with quotes and sources listed on the card, filed under approximate date of the building construction, predominantly for buildings in New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Boston. The cards have been left in Weisman's original order with his original category titles (additional descriptions are given in brackets), with the exception of a miscellaneous box subsequently placed within this original arrangement. There are small 3 ½ x 5 inch photos scattered among the note cards, almost of all of which are available in the mounted copy prints and negative series. These prints are with the appropriate description of the building. Less than one quarter of the cards have an accompanying print.</p><p>This series is further divided into four subseries. The first subseries has the card files for New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Boston. Miscellaneous Philadelphia cards are also found in subseries four. The second subseries has cards on general building types. The third subseries has cards on countries outside the United States, and the fourth has cards on American cities.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1285_6r1" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>NEW YORK, PHILADELPHIA, CHICAGO, BOSTON</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref1286_b24" level="file"><did><unittitle>circa 17th century -- 1851</unittitle><container id="aspace_657848ea233c942a571dd5ffc44e60fc" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">61</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1287_htf" level="file"><did><unittitle>1852 -- 1858</unittitle><container id="aspace_8bb6e752b1ea5755780ba6f7540a9b88" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">62</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1288_5g5" level="file"><did><unittitle>1859 -- 1884</unittitle><container id="aspace_dd605e2065cc282251acc0ec27f73254" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">63</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1289_vq8" level="file"><did><unittitle>1885 -- 1901</unittitle><container id="aspace_7f41f6d23bfc02a3be900bdba2e9d9c2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">64</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1290_xaz" level="file"><did><unittitle>1902 -- 1958; undated</unittitle><container id="aspace_938695a29685e84fd353eda5ab4c7e31" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">65</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8b738db1fa65e7159b91666d28f2edd0"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>See also Box 66 (for Boston and Philadelphia)</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_ref1292_r98" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>BUILDING TYPES</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref1293_9p6" level="file"><did><unittitle>architectural styles - general<lb/>hotels<lb/>motels<lb/>railway stations<lb/>garage and service stations<lb/>radio and television stations</unittitle><container id="aspace_0af24faa35d93222f383aacf25312f08" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">65</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1294_utz" level="file"><did><unittitle>factories; cast iron front buildings</unittitle><container id="aspace_f9b45f46bed7be7ad490df65e45f9d0e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">66</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref1295_nm8" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>INTERNATIONAL CITIES</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref1296_4ql" level="file"><did><unittitle>Greece<lb/>Rome [ancient] <lb/>English [United Kingdom] <lb/>Flanders [Belgium]<lb/>France<lb/>Germany <lb/>Italy <lb/>Holland [Netherlands] <lb/>Spain<lb/>miscellaneous architecture <lb/>negatives</unittitle><container id="aspace_0228c22a9830def0c196f59a6b266385" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">66</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref1297_bp0" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>AMERICAN CITIES</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref1298_uud" level="file"><did><unittitle>Philadelphia, PA [miscellaneous]<lb/>Chicago, IL<lb/>Minneapolis, MN<lb/>St. Louis, MN<lb/>San Francisco, CA<lb/>Boston, MA<lb/>Providence, RI<lb/>Kansas City, MO <lb/>Los Angeles, CA<lb/>Pittsburgh, PA <lb/>miscellaneous [predominantly Baltimore, MD]<lb/>general architecture cards</unittitle><container id="aspace_0142a47b856c3206b407abc52fadda7f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">66</container></did></c></c></c><c id="aspace_ref1300_ny9" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series IV. Project Soho</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b28fb286b9d75379250030d8aefb8a62"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This series consists of the records of Project Soho, an architectural and cultural study commissioned by Pennsylvania State University and funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The records date from 1970, the year of the grant application, through 1973. The initial purpose of the project, as put forward by Dr. Weisman, was to provide the necessary research to create an historical account of what was formerly a fine urban commercial district that had since deteriorated, but was capable of being restored to its original condition. He wanted to preserve a part of unique American architectural history that had no counterpart anywhere. Weisman's students wrote the reports and took the photos. Credit for individual work is arranged within the work in the reports.</p><p>Dr. Weisman and his students looked at the primary and secondary sources of art historians, sociologists, cultural geographers, economists, architectural engineers, and urban historians to discover the factors which shaped the character of the Soho district. A number of these student reports and some primary sources used by these students exist as reports within this series. All of the original grant funding proposals are also available giving detailed information concerning all the participants in this project and their aims.</p><p>Detailed building information sheets covering the entire Soho district form the bulk of this series. Information available for each building includes alterations made since the date of construction. Much of this information was derived from the original building application filed at the time of construction. It covers both financial and architectural information. Most of these data sheets have an accompanying photograph of the building. The data forms, with accompanying print, are the most unique aspect of this series.</p><p>The remainder of this series is made up of photos that document the entire area of Soho. 5 x 8 inch copy prints are filed by street address and span all of this cast iron district covering the area bordered by West Broadway, West Houston, Crosby and Canal Streets. Also available are the prints and negatives of the rolls of film as taken by the students. There are cross-indexed indices to guide the way through these prints. These include the originals of the 5 x 8 prints, as well as difficult to read prints of original architects' drawings and various specific details of the buildings, including windows, doors, and ornaments. Many of these prints are available in the series of mounted copy prints.</p><p>This project was, in a great part, responsible for the designation of Soho as the SoHo Cast Iron Historic District. The Soho Cast Iron Historic District has 139 iron fronted buildings, all of which are represented in this series.</p><p>This series is divided into three subseries: information forms, reports, and copy prints.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1301_25r" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>INFORMATION FORMS</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_89d712c0311834cc84bd093494ef532d"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>This subseries consists of information forms from Project Soho arranged alphabetically by street name and, within that arrangement by street number and side of street, e.g. east side of Broadway and then the west side of Broadway, and north side of Broome Street followed by the south side of Broome Street.

This arrangement conforms to Weisman's arrangement as set up in his indices. These indices are the first sub-subseries and provide thorough cross-indexing for all the copy prints. The second sub-subseries is 5 x 8 copy prints arranged alphabetically by street name and side of street (e.g. Broadway, east side). The third sub-subseries is the 35mm film prints of the front of the Soho buildings arranged by roll numbers one through forty-two, based on the Weisman index. The fourth sub-subseries is the 120mm film print copies of original architects' drawings arranged by roll number A through Z, from the Weisman index. The fifth sub-subseries is the 35mm film prints of original architects' drawings arranged by roll number AA to EE in order to maintain the order of the Weisman index. The sixth sub-subseries is 120 mm film of specific details of Soho buildings arranged by roll number HB (1) through to HB (6), also to correspond to the Weisman index. The seventh, and final, sub-subseries consists of miscellaneous Soho prints that were a part of Project Soho.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1401_42g" level="otherlevel"

V. Laing Stores Project</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_82d2a050dec9af7ac8ce76316291ba8e"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>One of Weisman's first tasks as a commissioned consultant to the New York City Landmarks was to oversee the dismantling of the historic Laing Stores, the oldest block of cast iron in America and one of the earliest milestones of modernism, designed in 1849 by the mechanical engineer and inventor James Bogardus (1800 -- 1874). The Smithsonian Institution sponsored Weisman's photographic documentation of the event as a part of a traveling exhibition in the 1970's.</p><p>This series consists of exhibition information and a daily journal of disassembly of the Laing Stores, made by field supervisor Benjamin Walbert. A selection of photos from eighteen rolls of film taken during the disassembly project is available in this series, as both negatives and prints.</p><p>This series in unique in giving both a history of the design and construction of an important building in combination with its dismantling and partial reassembly, and revealing the interrelationship of brick and timber construction with the use of cast iron facades.</p><p>The real estate on which the Laing Stores stood was turned over to the City University of New York for the projected Manhattan Community College, in exchange for which the CUNY, agreed to re-erect the Laing building within the college complex. The iron sections were placed in a storage area. This projected project was never brought to fruition. These sections were later to be part of another never begun project as part of the Washington Market Urban Renewal Project. The Bogardus Building on the South Street Seaport Museum block was then originally designed as an armature to house the cast iron components of the Laing Stores. Unfortunately, the valuable pieces were stolen for scrap metal in two incidents (1974, 1977). The Bogardus Building was built with a façade using a concept of exposed steel, an abstraction of Bogardus' original design, which inspired this new building but no longer containing any of the original ironwork of the Laing Stores.</p><p>In 1990, Weisman donated two architectural pieces of decorative elements from the Laing Stores, designed by William L. Miller, that are located in Decorative Arts at the New-York Historical Society.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_8d1273e6db7e8e12be89dcc4b6f3e4ff"><head>Arrangement</head><p>This series is divided into two subseries: reports and prints.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref1513_a3y" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>REPORTS</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref1514_g5d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Laing Stores Survey 1971<lb/>journal of disassembly by Benjamin Walbert<lb/>copies of demolition company's daily reports</unittitle><container id="aspace_3274bd5e422ac7d31724b127cc0843c6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">87</container><container parent="aspace_3274bd5e422ac7d31724b127cc0843c6" type="Folder">913</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1515_kmf" level="file"><did><unittitle>Disassembly of the Laing Stores<lb/>preliminary report and rough draft of press releases</unittitle><container id="aspace_7ac2f3a540cadfd87f48c03e381426fe" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">87</container><container parent="aspace_7ac2f3a540cadfd87f48c03e381426fe" type="Folder">914</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1516_lqz" level="file"><did><unittitle>exhibition text and published brochure</unittitle><container id="aspace_9f8ccc3a2ac6bd1f39ffd30ea881d97e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">87</container><container parent="aspace_9f8ccc3a2ac6bd1f39ffd30ea881d97e" type="Folder">915</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref1517_gdd" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>PRINTS</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref1518_bvz" level="file"><did><unittitle>used for Historic American Buildings Survey</unittitle><container id="aspace_db4835919aab53df983b9ff8ce02816f" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">87</container><container parent="aspace_db4835919aab53df983b9ff8ce02816f" type="Folder">916</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1519_zh2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Roll #1 -- Roll #4</unittitle><container id="aspace_98027eaae029c263e846e5a519056637" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">87</container><container parent="aspace_98027eaae029c263e846e5a519056637" type="Folder">917-920</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1520_gy1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Roll #5 -- Roll #18</unittitle><container id="aspace_c7146a1b9923262a717ad68b1e2b6982" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">88</container><container parent="aspace_c7146a1b9923262a717ad68b1e2b6982" type="Folder">921-934</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1521_s7u" level="file"><did><unittitle>miscellaneous, including shots of workmen involved in disassembly</unittitle><container id="aspace_a20040242431f01a0148782a81afca5d" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">88</container><container parent="aspace_a20040242431f01a0148782a81afca5d" type="Folder">935</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref1597_euu" level="file"><did><unittitle>oversize prints from Laing Stores Project exhibition (1 of 2)</unittitle><container id="aspace_c148520f1cb01143735066bb581e1644" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">97</container></did></c><c id="aspace_2c73318b70052159b6355e9b55d8debd" level="file"><did><unittitle>oversize prints from Laing Stores Project exhibition (2 of 2)</unittitle><container id="aspace_06c78ca2ad530191389d2beea6cff784" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">98</container></did></c></c></c><c id="aspace_ref1523_xmv" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series VI.
