            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>James J. Comerford, a native of Co. Kilkenny, emigrated to New York City in 1925. He was born on New Years' Day 1901 and died at the age of 87 in 1988. He worked at a variety of jobs including as as a ticket agent for the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT) at night while attending college during the day. Of note is that Comerford decided at the age of 33 he needed to get his high school dkiploma which he did and then at the age of 34 matriculated at Columbia to earn his bachelor's. He then went on to get his master's and finally his J.D from Fordam University. Comerford retired as a Judge of the Magistrates Court in 1971.</p>
            <p>The Judge was active in many Irish organizations and was an outspoken Irish Nationalist. He served nineteen years as chairman of the New York St. Patrick's Day Parade and was also a past president of the United Irish Counties Assocation. Comerford was a member and National Historian of the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) for 52 years and edited the organization's 
                <emph render="italic">Hibernian Digest</emph>. Many files pertaining to his work in the AOH are included in the collection. Of interest in the collection are Comerford's original handwritten drafts and typed manuscript for the memoir "My Kilkenny IRA Days". Comerford joined the IRA in his teens and the memoir covers the years 1920-1923, providing an intimate look at the activities of this citizen soldier organization and as well as life in Ireland in the early 20th century.</p>
            <p>Comerford was married to Vera Carr. They had no children.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The collection documents James J. Comerford's career from the 1960s on, specifically his nomination to a Federal Judgeship, his membership in various associations, mostly Irish-American and his personal life. Career files include correspondence from notable politicians such as John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Tip O'Neill as well as labor union leaders such as Mike Quill of the Transport Workers Union and Harry Van Arsdale of the AFL-CIO, writing in support of Comerford’s nomination to the Federal Court. A good bit of Comerford's personal history is provided, as told in his manuscript, "My Kilkenny IRA Days, 1916-1922." The handwritten and subsequently typed drafts provide a detailed glimpse into the daily life of a member of the Irish Republican Army in the early 1900s, subsequent to the Easter Rising of 1916.</p>
            <p>After immigrating to the States and working first as a dishwasher and then a ticket agent for the IRT, Comerford decided he should obtain his high school diploma and did so at the age of 33. He then went on to earn his bachelors from Columbia University as well as his master’s and finally his J.D., from Fordham University. Comerford kept some of his educational materials such as course listings and grades which can be found in Series I under Education.</p>
            <p>The Judge was active in several organizations in New York, notably the Saint Patrick's Day Parade and Celebration Committee and the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH). He was also the editor of the AOH’s publication, the 
                <emph render="italic">Hibernian Digest</emph>, and the collection contains several files on his activities in the Order, as well as photographs and negatives used in the Digest. United Irish Counties Association, collection AIA 003, contains a history Comerford wrote on the formation of the UICA in America (AIA 003, Box 3, Folder 18.) Newspaper clippings which are quite fragile and brittle with age, document Comerford’s career and personal life. Numerous photographs of Judge Comerford and his wife Vera are in included in Series II. Photographs, as are images of Comerford involved in activities pertaining to the St. Patrick’s Day Parade, Ancient Order of Hibernians and other associations.</p>
