    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Maurice Brill (1869-1951) was a clothier/haberdasher and, later, a real estate investor. With his brothers Samuel and Max, Maurice was the proprietor of the New York City men's clothing chain, Brill Brothers, founded in 1887. The operation expanded in the city, eventually to include a location in a building newly-constructed in 1930 at 1619 Broadway, at 49th Street. Shortly after its construction, the Brills bought the building, which became known as the Brill Building. The clothing business was liquidated in 1940 but Brill continued to own 1619 Broadway. He died in New York in 1951. </p><p>(The above note was based primarily on Brill's obituary from the New York Times of July 7, 1951.)</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The albums of 1919 and 1926 were previously described and included in N-YHS's general collection of albums (PR 2). In September 2021, archivist Larry Weimer combined the two albums and the related description with a third album into this newly formed collection centered on Maurice Brill.</p>  </processinfo>

Kisco, New York, and was owned at this time by Brill. The 72-acre estate featured an 18-room country house, guest cottage, stables, pool, tennis courts, and farm buildings. Brill, who developed Meadow Edge Farm over a period of approximately 25 years, sold the estate to clothier Samuel W. Kappel in 1939.
