    <abstract id="aspace_e997394c2eebfe569ea5bc5f04d2c567">Park West Village (PWV) was developed in the late-1950s and early-1960s as part of a government-subsidized urban redevelopment project on Manhattan's Upper West Side; located between 97th to 100th streets, Central Park West, and Columbus Avenue. The Working Group at Park West Village began in 2009 to define and represent the community's interests.  Records of the Working Group at Park West Village (2011-2017) consist of legal documents on paper and electronic files that offer insight to the Park West Village community's opposition to the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged, operated by the New Jewish Home, on proposing construction of a twenty-story nursing home on the Upper West Side of New York City. The records consist primarily of expert, political, and community testimonies, preliminary and final reports of the New York State Department of Health Environment Impact Studies (FEIS), which the Working Group forced by uncovering and sourcing toxins, and traces of lead in the proposed building space. The records also include letters and signatures of protest addressed to the New York State Department of Health from members of the Park West Village community, parents, faculty, and other members of Public School 163 (P.S. 163) who shared their concerns about the dangers of exposing students to lead. The materials also contain court transcripts, affidavits, documents on open space and zoning issues raised by the Working Group at the New York City Board of Standards and Appeals, and the legal judgments that followed.</abstract>

<p>Records of the Working Group at Park West Village (2011-2017) consist of legal documents on paper and electronic files that offer insight to the Park West Village community's opposition to the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged, operated by the New Jewish Home, on proposing construction of a twenty-story nursing home on the Upper West Side of New York City. The records consist primarily of expert, political, and community public comments and testimonies, preliminary and final reports of the New York State Department of Health Environment Impact Studies, which the Working Group forced by uncovering and sourcing toxins, and traces of lead in the proposed building space. The records also include letters and petitions of protest addressed to the New York State Department of Health from members of the Park West Village community, parents, faculty, and other members of Public School 163 (P.S. 163) who shared their concerns about the dangers of exposing students to lead.

<p>Park West Village (PWV) was developed in the late-1950s and early-1960s as part of a government-subsidized urban redevelopment project on Manhattan's Upper West Side; located between 97th to 100th streets, Central Park West, and Columbus Avenue. The PWV includes approximately five-thousand resident condominium owners, rent stabilized, and market rate tenants. The Working Group at Park West Village began in 2009 to define and represent the community's interests against the proposals and development of the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged on West 100th street.</p>  </bioghist>
