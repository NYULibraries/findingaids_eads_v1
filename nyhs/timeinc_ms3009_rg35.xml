    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p><title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title> (SI) launched on August 16, 1954 as a weekly magazine with managing editor Sidney James and publisher Harry Phillips.</p><p>According to an unsigned capsule history in the General Files, Time Inc. cofounder and president Henry R. Luce asked executive vice president Howard Black to come up with new publishing venture ideas. Black's May 21, 1953 letter to Luce contained a paragraph reading: "A Sports Weekly -- everything in sports -- hunting, fishing, boating. this would be a picture magazine -- 10 cents a copy." By June 1953, Time Inc. set up a department to develop this magazine.</p><p>The "Editorial Notes" in the General Files state that SI was the first Time Inc. magazine to include bylines. It started with well-known sports writers. Later it incorporated articles from famous authors such as "[William] Faulkner and Catherine Drinker Bowen on the Derby," and "Robert Frost on the All-Star Game." Notable sports writers also began their careers as early SI staff writers including Robert Creamer and "Tex" Maule.</p><p>For the majority of Time Inc.'s existence, the company maintained a strict separation of editorial from the publishing and business side of each magazine, colloquially called the separation of "church" (editorial) and "state" (publishing).  Publishing and Business Management includes the publisher, general manager, business manager, advertising sales, marketing services, letters, circulation, and public relations. The editorial side reported up to the editor-in-chief and the publishing/business side reported up to the corporate business executive which was the president prior to 1960 and the chief executive officer after. Luce structured Time Inc. this way so that the business side could not (in theory) influence the editorial content of the publications. For example, the advertising sales people could not interfere with a magazine's decision to run an article on the dangers of cigarette smoking, even though it might mean losing millions of dollars in tobacco ads.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>Hooper, Bill.

While the list of questions is not present, the answers start by defining the role of the sports writer and continue by stating the purpose of sports writing.

The letter from the publisher confirms Morris was part of the founding staff of SI and states he was one of the best known staff members. From 1980 until his retirement in 1986, the Department Heads Lists have him only as the special events director. Prior to SI, he worked in the circulation promotion department for Time Inc. getting <title render="italic">Time</title> and <title render="italic">Life</title> placed on newsstands and in supermarkets.</p><p>Morris's early files contain some materials addressed to and from Terry Rice. In 1959 <title render="italic">FYI</title> describes Terry (Teressa) Rice as the "beautiful publicity woman," but her title isn't recorded until 1970 when she is the SI director of press information.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>Barr, Donald J.

The date range of the materials indicate these attempts to attract advertisers happened during SI's first few years of operation. Stetson was the first advertiser in SI according to a speech by Hughes in his bio file.</p><p>The General section contain the market research along with fact sheets about (SI), subscriber research, speeches, and other collected material to assist in the promotion of SI. General files also includes a folder of all the empty folders retained that includes names of companies that were possibly targeted as advertisers by SI.</p><p>The Presentation section include scripts of presentations tailored to industries or individual companies to demonstrate why they should advertise in SI. The Pepsi-Cola presentation makes the case for SI as a "merchandising tool."

The arrangement was imposed by the archivist. The materials were initially in one box, had no order, and were loose or in folders that were unlabeled or had labels with no relation to the contents. Several folders were initially empty, and the archivist matched up the empty folders with the correct materials within the box. Ultimately empty folders with titles of companies were retained as they may have been targets of promotional presentations.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_3d70d1f256da0604b0037ef02eb1c693" level="file"><did><unittitle>General: Empty Folders</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">circa 1955</unitdate><container id="aspace_96c0c25db488cd2f2cb64dca12160a03" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010557]" type="Offsite-Box">4140</container><container parent="aspace_96c0c25db488cd2f2cb64dca12160a03" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ed8efa0f5aed740a3394bd8a144bc5af" level="file"><did><unittitle>General: Air Travel: Report of a survey Conducted Among Overseas Air Passengers Departing From N.Y.

Records come from various staff of the Merchandising Department including merchandising manager George Trescher; Eleanor Lambert, owner of Eleanor Lambert Inc. Publicity, contracted for SI's first year; West Coast merchandising representative Marjorie Kessler; and merchandising representatives Ruth Lieder, Mary Mitchell, Eleanor Montville, Alberta Scribner, and Fred Smith. Extensive correspondence from Trescher is throughout the files. Files for assistant publishers Richard "Dick" Neale and Harry Phillips and advertising promotion manager Bill Scherman include memoranda to them reporting on Merchandising's efforts. The Merchandising Working File also contains some of the earliest correspondence from founding managing editor Sidney James.</p><p>Records include correspondence to and from retailers, form letters promoting the magazine, memoranda from merchandising represenatives reporting on their activities and retailers' responses, press releases, lists of retailers contacted, and a few photographs of store displays featuring SI. Samples include posters, brochures, press kits and other specialized printed material promoting SI or retailers mentioning SI.</p><p>The presentation scripts from Merchandising are very similar in structure to those in Advertising Promotion although trying to place SI displays in retail stores instead of trying to place ads in SI. "The Sporting Look" refers to the weekly fashion feature in SI, and this feature was used to convince retailers to include SI in their merchandising plans. Suggestions to retailers are detailed in the Launching Letter to Retailers.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_b706799b97e7f9cc89d396e19e91cb21"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Organized alphabetically based on the original loose order.
