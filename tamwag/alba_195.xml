      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Frank Carl Costanzo (1912-1937?) was a waiter and union member from Pittsburgh,
        Pennsylvania. In early 1937, at 25 years old, Costanzo went to Spain to join the
        International Brigades, supporting the Loyalist cause in the Spanish Civil War. He hid the
        information that he had joined the war effort from his parents. After attending officers'
        training school, where he studied Spanish and military skills, Costanzo joined the staff of
        the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, and went with them into heavy action, fighting on at least
        four fronts. After spending time in a hospital with a sprained ankle, he returned to the
        front. Constanzo died in Spain in December 1937 or early 1938. He left behind a wife, Ida S.
        Costanzo and a son, Stan.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series I, Spanish Civil War Letters</emph>. The letters in this
        collection are almost all from Frank Costanzo to his wife, Ida, and written while Costanzo
        was in Spain. In them, Costanzo describes his day-to-day life in the battalion, touching
        upon details of the battalion's fight against fascist forces. In one letter, he writes by
        candlelight. In another, he writes from a dugout while under attack, with shells dropping
        very near to him. Responding to Ida's accusation that he had abandoned her, Costanzo tries
        to explain his reasons for having gone to Spain. In all the letters, Costanzo expresses his
        deep love for his wife and baby.</p>
