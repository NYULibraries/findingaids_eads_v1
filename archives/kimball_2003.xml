            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection contains administrative and miscellaneous files generated during Leroy Kimball's tenure at New York University and following his retirement. The records were transferred from the Treasurer's office from Kimball Hall in 1991 by Fred Knauth and Muriel Mantel and consist of 6 Hollinger boxes comprising 3 linear feet. Ranging in date from 1910 to 1963, the records were in fairly good condition and in approximate chronological order when received. It was for this reason that they were not broken up into various series. The current arrangement is topical and in chronological order by subject.</p>
            <p>The vast majority of these records are financial and include: receipts, bills, invoices, leases, budgets and their accompanying correspondence. The material originates from the following divisions or units: University Attorney's office, various schools and/or divisions, the Faculty Club, the First Avenue Association, the Council/Board of Trustees, Libraries, Hofstra College, Law Center, Medical Center, Bradley-Burgum Faculty Dismissal case, Hall of Fame and GPA Program with Syracuse University and the State University of New York. Worthy of particular note is the comprehensive file containing, clippings, correspondence, and other materials on the building of the Law School's Vanderbilt Hall in the 1950's and the accompanying protests and demonstrations regarding the evictions and demolition of residential property. In addition, there is a folder containing comprehensive correspondence and memorandums regarding NYU's agreement with Hofstra College in the 1920's and the subsequent dissolution of that agreement.</p>

            <p>Leroy Elwood Kimball retired from NYU in 1956 after 45 years as a financial officer of the University. Born in Flint, Michigan on October 31, 1888, he received his Bachelor's Degree from Albion College in 1910 and became City Editor of the Albion Evening Recorder in Michigan for one year before coming to NYU as an assistant Bursar in 1911. On June 17, 1914, he married Gipsy Robinson and received his Master's from NYU in 1917. During his tenure, he held the following positions: Assistant Bursar from 1911-1920, Bursar from 1920-1925, Comptroller from 1925-1945, and Vice Chancellor and Comptroller from 1945-1956.</p>
            <p>In addition to the positions he held at NYU Kimball was very active in other matters. He was a trustee of the American Scenic &amp; Historic Preservation Society and its president from 1933 to 1941. In 1937, Kimball was appointed by Governor Lehman to the New York State Commission to Survey Scenic, Historic and Commercial assets of the Hudson River valley. He was a member of the Advisory Committee of Historical and Patriotic Societies at the New York World's Fair of 1939, and in 1933, was the treasurer of the Association of American Colleges. Kimball belonged to the Andiron Club of New York, The Pilgrims, Phi Beta Kappa and other groups, was a trustee of Albion College and wrote numerous monographs. He made his home on Buckberg Mountain, Tomkins Cove-on-Hudson, New York and "Brooklands" in Surrey, England. In 1959, Kimball Hall was named in his honor.</p>

            <p>Institutional records of New York University are closed for a period of 20 years from the date of their creation (the date on which each document was written). Board of Trustees records are similarly closed for 35 years from the date of creation. The opening date for files spanning several years will be 20 years from the most recent date. Access will be given to material already 20 years old contained within a collection that is not yet open when such material can be isolated from the rest of the collection.</p>
            <p>Materials related to personnel, faculty grievances, job searches and all files with information that falls under the University's Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) policy are permanently restricted.</p>
