    <abstract id="aspace_581e2242a9be318cd2196575cdb33c70">Two letters from Arthur Tappan, writing from New York to Samuel Fisher. On September 26, 1824, Tappan informed Fisher of his desire to place his 11 year old son at a school that would provide not just a good education, but would do so "where his morals may not be corrupted by improper associates, and where serious impressions and religious principles are most likely to be promoted." Looking for a school in the country, Tappan asked Fisher for his opinion of Bloomfield Academy. The second letter to Fisher, dated January 2, 1825, makes clear that Tappan's son, as well as his nephew, were then attending the Academy. However, Tappan expresses his deep concern about the "prevalence" of smoking at the school, which he observed when there during examinations and which was confirmed to him by the principal, Mr. Armstrong, and his daughters. Tappan also notes that his son informed him of the prevalence of drunkenness and profanity as well. Tappan reports that a Mr. Lord agress with his concerns and Tappan urges Fisher to initiate an investigation and seek to remedy the situation through the Education Society Board.<lb/> <lb/>
