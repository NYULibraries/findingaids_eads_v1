            <p>This collection of records of the Alumni Association of New York University consists of the early records of the Association and dates from 1839 to 1934. This collection is organized into two separate series.</p>
            <p>Series I consists of the Alumni Scrapbook and dates from 1846 to 1886. The Alumni Scrapbook was compiled by William R. Martin, secretary of the Association, in 1886. It consists primarily of the early records of the Association, including its constitution, draft resolutions and correspondence between various officers. Historical figures represented in the scrapbook include: S.F.B. Morse, J.W. Draper, John Taylor Johnston, Theodore Frelinghuysen, Isaac Ferris, and various other notables. The Alumni Scrapbook also consists of the Smith Lectures, a series of public lectures arranged by the Association and given by distinguished Alumni in order to raise proceeds to purchase a farm for Joseph E. Smith, janitor at NYU for 35 years, in appreciation of his service to the University.</p>
            <p>Due to both the great historical importance of the papers as well their deteriorating condition, each individual page has been removed and placed in its own acid-free folder. However, the order of the materials has not been disturbed, and each folder now bears the number of the page of the scrapbook whose contents it contains.</p>
            <p>Series II of this collection consists of the Alumni Association Minutes and dates from 1846-1934. This series is organized into five seperate boxes, each arranged in chronological order and containing one bound copy of Association meeting minutes. Each bound copy is fragile and must be handled with care.</p>

            <head>History of the University of the City of New York Association of Alumni</head>
            <p>The New York University (then the University of the City of New York) Association of Alumni Scrapbook dates from 1846 to 1856 and was compiled by William R. Martin, Secretary of the Association, in 1886. The scrapbook consists of the earliest records of the Association, including the earliest copy of the constitution, draft resolutions, election ballots, as well as correspondence between various officers. New York University notables represented in the Scrapbook include: S.F.B. Morse, J.W. Draper, John Taylor Johnston, Theodore Frelinghuysen, Isaac Ferris, and Cornelius Mathews.</p>
            <p>Cornelius Mathews was the first president of the Alumni Association. He graduated from New York University in 1834 and is an American writer best known for his role in the formation of the literary group Young America in the late 1830s, as well as for his support of a distinctly American style of literary expression.</p>
            <p>Theodore Frelinghuysen served as a United States Senator from 1829 to 1835, representing New Jersey, and was nominated as the United States Secretary of State in 1881. He served as the Chancellor of New York University from 1839 to 1850. He is represented in the Scrapbook through both his letters to the Association as well as through his participation in the Smith Lectures.</p>
            <p>Isaac Ferris was a clergyman in the Reformed Dutch Church of America as well as a University administrator. He was the Chancellor of New York University from 1853 until 1870. He is represented in the Scrapbook through both his letters to the Association as well as through his participation in commencement-related activities.</p>
            <p>John William Draper was a scientist, historian and photographer. He served as both a professor and president of the New York University School of Medicine. He is represented in the Scrapbook through his letters to the Association as well as through his address to alumni.</p>
            <p>Samuel Morse was an accomplished artist and founder of the National Academy of Design. He is also credited as the co-inventor of Morse code, as well as co-contributor to the invention of the single-wire telegraph. At New York University, Morse lectured widely on art and was appointed, in 1832, as Chair of Sculpture and Painting at the University. He is represented in the Scrapbook through his correspondence with various faculty members and alumni.</p>
            <p>The Alumni Association Scrapbook also largely consists of material related to the Smith Lectures. Joseph E. Smith was a janitor at New York University for 35 years. Upon his retirement, the Alumni Association, in appreciation of his service, purchased a farm for Smith, to be paid for by subscription. Unfortunately, not enough money was raised through subscription, so the Executive Committee resolved to institute a series of public lectures, which were to be given gratis by distinguished University alumni. The proceeds from tbe ticket sales of these lectures were used to clear the remaining debt for the farm.</p>
            <p>The Alumni Association Minutes date from the earliest meetings of the Association and its Executive Committee. They are divided into five boxes, which have been arranged chronologically.</p>
