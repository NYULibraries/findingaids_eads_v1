This collection is comprised of forty-four interviews documenting the experiences of individuals living as squatters in New York City between the 1980s and the 2000s. Interviews included in this project touch on a number of topics including general discussions about the experience and politics of squatting; legalization of squats and negotiations with the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB); gentrification; and the experiences of women and minorities in squats. The majority of squatters interviewed in this collection lived in Manhattan’s Lower East Side, but the collection also contains discussion of squats in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx.</abstract>

            <p>This collection was created in two parts. Interviews from this first part of this project were created by a Jeremy Sorgen, an undergraduate student at New York University, on behalf of the Tamiment Library. Interviews from the second part of this project were created by Amy Starecheski for her scholarly research and later donated to Tamiment Library. Upon receipt of this second set of interviews, a finding aid was created to describe the entire collection, at which point interviews were divided into two series based on creator. Biographical and contextual information accompanying interviews were provided by Amy Starecheski, and later modified to conform to current archival descriptive standards (DACS).</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The Squatters' Collective Oral History Project was initiated by Tamiment Library in 2008 as a larger effort to document the squatters' movement in New York City. In 2008 Jeremy Sorgen, and undergraduate student at New York University, conducted seven oral history interviews on behalf of the Tamiment Library. The project was later continued by Amy Starecheski who conducted an additional thirty-seven interviews as research for her Ph.D. dissertation in Cultural Anthropology at the City University of New York, which focused on squatting and the transformation of squats into limited equity, low-income co-ops.</p>
            <p>The history of squatting in New York City can be traced back to the nineteenth century, but the movement documented by this oral history project began as an outgrowth of an economic and housing crisis in the 1970s. Reacting to a lack of affordable housing and displacement caused by urban renewal projects, a number of city residents sought alternative housing by occupying vacant buildings in the city. Squatters in New York City were a diverse group that included bohemian artists, activists, undocumented immigrants, and displaced locals, among others. Throughout the 1990s, building owners and city officials worked to evict many of the squats, and while many were torn down or reclaimed by the city, squatters staged a number of successful efforts which allowed them to remain in their buildings. By the end of the 1990s, a number of squatters who still retained control of their buildings approached the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), a non-profit organization dedicated to converting city-owned buildings into low-income cooperatives, in an attempt to establish legal ownership of their homes. Over the years that followed, squatters in the Lower East Side began negotiations with UHAB and eventually reached a deal in 2002, which allowed UHAB to acquire eleven buildings that would eventually be sold back to residents once they were renovated and brought up to code. Many of the squats struggled to complete renovations to their buildings, however, and as of 2013 only five of the eleven buildings completed the legalization process.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection is comprised of 44 interviews documenting the experiences of individuals living as squatters in New York City between the 1970s and the 2000s. The majority of squatters interviewed in this collection lived in Manhattan’s Lower East Side, but the collection also contains discussion of squats in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx. Individuals interviewed for this project come from diverse backgrounds and speak to the multitude of experiences among squatters.</p>
            <p>Interviews in this collection address the general experience of life as a squatter in New York, and a large portion focus specifically on the process of transforming squats into legal, limited equity, low-income co-ops. In their discussions about legalization, interviewees recount their negotiations with the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), gentrification, reasons for seeking legalization, and their general opinions about the process. A number of interviews in this collection also touch on squatters' experiences, discussing the politics, organization, and social structure of squats. Several interviews also highlight the experiences of women and minorities living in squats, addressing issues including discrimination, underrepresentation, and child rearing. Additionally, the collection contains a number of interviews with housing rights activists who assisted squatters in their attempts to gain ownership of their buildings.</p>
            <p>Oral history interviews in Series I: Interviews by Jeremy Sorgen were recorded as audio files, which were transferred to Access and Master CDs. Files from Series II: Interviews by Amy Starecheski were recorded as digital audio files and also consist of transcripts and JPEG images of the interviewees.</p>

                        <p>In this interview Gerald Wade, aka Jerry the Peddler describes the earliest roots of organized squatting on the Lower East Side. He describes the Yippie squatting actions of the late 1970s and the Pope of Pot, a squatter, drug dealer, and cult leader. He discusses the importance of food, beer, and pot as organizing tools. Wade also describes the development and defense of La Plaza Cultural, where in 1986 they fed up to 500 people a day; some of those people opened Serenity House. He discusses the mounting tensions over Tompkins Square Park in the late 1980s, the riots, and ongoing protests, with which he was centrally involved. He also talks about the 1988 fire at 319 8th Street, and subsequent eviction and demolition of the building. The first session of the interview ends suddenly with a discussion of the May Day and Pot Parade actions in 1990. In the second session, Wade discusses the Triad, Tia Scott, his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction in the 1990s, the defense of the ABC Community Center, the 13th Street eviction, the eviction of Dos Blocos, and anarchist/communist dynamics in anti-war activism during the Persian Gulf War. He discusses the archives at Tamiment, his own archives, and the importance of history. He talks about how he got sober. Wade talks about the pig roasts he used to organize for May Day. He also discusses the legalization process, his experiences of becoming a homeowner, and the potential for squatting today.</p>

                        <p>Gerald Wade, aka Jerry the Peddler, grew up in west Texas. He was raised by his father and grandparents, and left home at age 15, which he notes as common experience among people in the squats. At 17 he joined the army. Having been a teenager in the 1960s, he acquired an “us against them” attitude, and during his time in the army became involved in Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and anti-war activism, even while living on a base in California. When he was supposed to go to Vietnam, Wade went AWOL and lived in the hills in Big Sur for a month. He spent time in Los Angeles and then moved to Fort Worth, Texas where he was involved with draft counseling and the White Panthers. After getting arrested for being AWOL several times he went to Washington, DC for the 1971 May Day protests, where he was detained in RFK Stadium with 20,000 other protesters. He stayed in DC and got involved with the Yippies, who he cites as an important influence on the squatting scene. Between 1974 and 1980 started a relationship, had begun working steadily, and withdrew from politics. After his relationship ended in 1980, however, Wade moved to New York where he once again became involved in political activism. In New York he became connected with people in The Triad, squatted buildings on 7th Street by Avenue D, organized by Everything for Everybody, and after spending some time living in Tompkins Square Park settled in a squatted building on 9th Street. Wade also helped to organize Rock Against Regan, a touring concert, and when the group returned to NYC in 1984, and Wade and others from the group opened the building at 319 East 8th Street. After that point a number of buildings opened up along 8th Street.</p>

                        <p>In this interview Steven Englander discusses the 1980 founding of ABC No Rio and its surrogate parent organization Collaborative Projects (Colab). He discusses ABC No Rio’s changing relationships with squatting and politics, describing the process by which No Rio became a social and practical hub of the squatting scene in the mid-1990s and how squatters played a central role in direct action campaigns to protect No Rio.</p>
                        <p>He describes the decision-making process leading up to the plan to rebuild ABC No Rio rather than renovate. He also discusses the shifting dynamics of ABC No Rio and the local community, noting that few people who currently participate at No Rio actually live on the Lower East Side. In 1999 Englander moved into Umbrella House, a squat on Avenue C, and discusses the organization of that building. He also talks about characters from the scene, and why he would not characterize it as a movement, arguing that it did not go beyond squatting as a practice, or extend beyond the neighborhood and did not question private property.</p>

                        <p>Steven Englander grew up in Wisconsin, the child of a pediatrician and a nurse. He attended private school and was raised in a comfortable, liberal environment with an emphasis on social justice. Drawn to the city’s mythos, in 1980 he moved to New York City to attend New York University's film school. After becoming interested in Situationist critiques of media and Marxist economic theory in the mid-1980s, Englander got involved in the anarchist scene and later squatting. While working part-time as a production assistant and taxi driver, he wrote zines, fiction, and non-fiction about urbanism and political events. He was involved with the Black Eye zine, the Anarchist Switchboard, and ABC No Rio. In 1990 he became the assistant director of ABC No Rio. He later moved into No Rio as a squatter in 1994, with others, to defend the space against possible self-help eviction by the city. In 1997, he and all other residents at No Rio willingly vacated as part of a deal with the city to preserve No Rio as a community space, including a print shop, darkroom, computer room, and zine library. After almost a decade of raising money for renovations, in 2006 ABC No Rio acquired title to the building and began planning to rebuild.</p>

                        <p>In this interview Carla Cubit talks briefly about her early life and describes her feelings of alienation from her family and friends. Later, she describes squatter politics and art, including squatter May Day, and John the Communist. She recalls dumpster diving to get food for the 13th Street community kitchen and being bullied by Butch, who terrorized the neighborhood. Cubit argues that the buildings with more people of color in them were evicted over time, while the majority white buildings were allowed to become co-ops; with gentrification squatted buildings have been literally and metaphorically white-washed. In the interview she mentions that when she sees people from that era on the streets she feels they avoid her. Cubit noticed that squatters were mostly white and middle class, and there were few black people, fewer black women and wondered if she was a token. She describes the cliquishness of the buildings on 13th Street, factionalization in the squatter community and tensions with other neighborhood residents, yet she still remembers it as a utopia of creativity, independence, and community. She recalls using piss buckets, stealing cable, and heating with wood stoves.</p>

                        <p>Carla Cubit grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, where she was raised by her mother. She moved around frequently during childhood, and her mother struggled with alcohol and crack addiction. As a result Cubit often lived with her aunts. When she was 18, her boyfriend was killed, and Cubit left Missouri for New York City, hoping to get into theater. She had no place to stay, and ended up in shelters, where she was diagnosed as schizophrenic. She attended Borough of Manhattan Community College, studying liberal arts and became aware of alternative lifestyles, politics, and squatting. She also got involved with Unforgotten Voices, a homeless arts group, Hobo Theater, anti-psychiatry groups, and participated in a homeless encampment in City Hall Park. Cubit did some work days at a squat on 13th Street and then was invited to live there. After moving into 13th Street Cubit began selling art through American Primitive Gallery, as an “outsider artist,” and performing spoken word and theater. Since 13th Street was evicted, she stopped squatting, and her art stopped selling. At the time of the interview Cubit lived in the projects and was a self-described “internet addict.”</p>

                        <p>In the first session, Frank Morales discusses his upbringing on the Lower East Side, his experiences in the 1960s liberation theology and decision to go to seminary, and his early experiences with squatting while working as a priest in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx. He describes the theory of spatial deconcentration and frames the abandonment of the 1970s as an attack on people of color and squatting as resistance to it. Later he discusses returning to the Lower East Side and squatting in that neighborhood, including losing several buildings to arson. He compares squatting in the Bronx and on the Lower East Side. In the second session, Morales primarily discussed his ideology regarding the value of property and the right to housing. Although not originally involved in the decision to move forward with UHAB and the legalization process, Morales shared his thoughts and feelings about the decision and noted his support for having UHAB as an ally versus antagonistic forces. He also discusses the difficulties of funding the legalization process and the “normalization” of squatting.</p>

                        <p>In this brief interview, Brett Pants talks about how he found himself at C-Squat and how he began squatting at a very early age, starting when he was still attending high school. Pants discusses the manual labor that he and his fellow squatters put into rebuilding C-Squat, as well as the emotional investment that he made in regards to the building and the residents of C-Squat, who he considers family. Pants admits that he never really believed that the legalization process would take place, and at the time of the interview felt very disillusioned and frustrated with what he perceived as UHAB’s lack of progress in the whole process.</p>

In 1987 he went to several meetings of an organization called the New York Nicaraguan Construction, which sent construction crews to Nicaragua. At these meetings he met people from 209 East 7th Street and ended up staying in that building after he returned from working in Nicaragua. In 1988 he got his own apartment in that building. After suffering through fires and conflicts within the building Yafet decided to leave the squatting scene. He later returned to East 7th Street in 1995.</p>

                        <p>Erin Williams describes the ending of the squatting scene and the acceleration of gentrification until a tipping point around 2007. She moved into C-Squat around 1999 and describes her first impressions of Alphabet City as surprisingly green but still just starting to gentrify. She talks about the social world of squatting and C-Squat particularly, over the past 13 years. Williams discusses gender relations and allocation of space in the building, and talks about the legalization process and the changes and challenges that came with it. Williams, who studied archeology at Brooklyn College, describes her decisions that led her to seek an education, and later her decision to not continue pursuing an academic career. She began working IT and accounting at a publishing company, and she discusses how squatting and legalization shaped her choices in life. She also discusses how she learned construction skills and built her apartment.</p>

                        <p>In this interview Fran Luck describes the Tompkins Square Riots of 1988 as the events that radicalized her and brought her into contact with the squatting scene. She discusses the contrast between the squatting movement and Cooper Square and the Village Independent Democrats, with which she had been involved previously. She describes the squatter’s political analysis, emphasizing planned spatial deconcentration and framing gentrification as genocide and the growing connections between organized homeless people and squatters. Luck moved to the Lower East Side in the 1960s and describes the neighborhood as a bohemian enclave, and the process of gentrification starting in the 1970s. In this interview Luck also talks about the squats in the 1990s, focusing on how they were organized, their politics, and problems with bullying, domestic violence, and sexism. She focuses on the sexism in the political wing of the movement and the dynamics of anarchism and communism. Luck also talks about the feminist radio show she hosted on Steal This Radio, which later moved to WBAI. Finally she discusses evictions (8th Street, 13th Street, ABC Community Center, Doc Blocos) and the process of legalization.</p>

                        <p>Fran Luck is a longtime housing activist and supporter of the squatting movement. She was raised in a lower-middle class Jewish family in New York City and came to the Lower East Side while she was a Cooper-Union student in the early 1960s. Luck worked in typography and became involved in the Second-wave feminist movement. She lived in a small apartment in the Lower East Side since the 1970s, and was not able to move because she could not find affordable housing elsewhere. Luck describes the neighborhood as a bohemian enclave, and the process of gentrification starting in the 1970s. In that environment of decentralized authority, she began organizing demonstrations, although she was viewed with suspicion as an older woman not involved in the squatting lifestyle. Luck organized the Lower East Side Squatting Support Committee to rally the support of respected organizations for squatters. She also describes the power squatters and their allies had in the aftermath of the Tompkins Square Riot. Luck was part of the second six-week occupation of ABC Community Center and describes her experience of that, particularly the misogyny of some occupiers and conflicts between communists and anarchists. After that occupation she started anti-gentrification organizing, founding RAGE ON - Revolt Against Gentrification Erasing Our Neighborhood.</p>

He also talks about his ideas about squatting, or homesteading as he prefers to call it, which are pro-legalization. He discusses his priorities in a building, which focus on getting the gas, heat, water and electricity turned on immediately. At 4th Street he and several other people quickly brought the building up to code, took legal action and became owners of the building, after which Marco sold his space in the building. Marco believes this should be the objective of all squatters but acknowledges that there are different objectives and different personalities within the movement.</p>

                        <p>George Marco was born and raised in New York City, predominately in the Hell’s Kitchen area. He first went down to hang out on the Lower East Side in the early 1980s and moved into a squat in 1986. When that squat started becoming overtaken by the drug crowd, Marco moved to Serenity House, which had just opened at the time. Next he spent a brief period of time in Bullet Space and then went back to Serenity and later helped open a squat on 10th Street. After 10th Street he opened and legalized a building on 4th Street, but then quickly sold his space in the building and left New York. Since then he has lived in various places in and out of New York. At the time of the interview he lived with his wife in Pennsylvania, but was planning to move back into the squat on 10th Street. He and his wife are performance artists who work with fire.</p>

The first covered Kaminsky's personal history and discussed how she ended up working at UHAB, as well as an overview of the squat legalization process, which was not recorded. This session was conducted via Skype video call, but only the audio has been recorded. This interview focuses on Kaminsky's observations of how squatters responded to and engaged with the legalization process. She discusses the appropriate role for non-profits like UHAB to play in a squatting campaign, assisting the squatters at their request. She discusses the romanticization of squatting by organizers in Buffalo where she worked most recently, in comparison to the real and difficult experience on the Lower East Side. She also talks about people’s conflicted feelings about commodifying their housing and commercial spaces and the city’s role, as the original legal owner of the buildings, in shaping the parameters of the legalization deal. She talks about warehousing and evictions in the legalizing squats. Kaminsky also discusses the challenges faced by the most marginal people during the legalization process, and the ways that people’s responses to the process varied along class and gender lines, especially in terms of leadership. Additionally Kaminsky discusses the risk of foreclosure of HDFCs.</p>

He also describes the life cycle of a squat, and life at C-Squat in the early days. He discusses gender and power dynamics at C-Squat. Popeye was the lead singer of the band Banji, and he discusses how squatting allowed him to stay in music even though it did not become a source of income for him. He describes the transition at C-Squat from a mixed group, with lots of Hungarians and other Europeans, to all young crusty punks, and how the group learned over time to work together as a collective. Finally, he talks about the legalization process and his experiences of becoming a homeowner.</p>

He speaks in detail about the 13th Street Adverse Possession case, for which he was the lead trial lawyer. Although Cohen and the squatters initially won the case, the ruling was overturned in the appeal process and the 13th Street squats were consequently evicted. Cohen talks about the difficulties of proving adverse possession. Cohen also discusses other legal action he was involved in, such as the conflict over fire barrels in Tompkins Square Park and defending squatters who got arrested at protests.</p>

                        <p>Tauno Biltsted describes the “chaotic and lovely” world of the Lower East Side in the 1980s, and how he got involved with squatting through the encampment at Tompkins Square Park. He moved into C-Squat in 1989, and describes the social and physical makeup of the building at that time, including drug use, decision-making, and the creation of the basement show space. He discusses the ABC Community Center occupation, and the complicated relationships between Tent City and the squatters, and homesteaders and squatters. He also talks about his experience living in Umbrella House. He describes the politics, organization, and physical condition of Umbrella House over the next 20 years, including rebuilding the infrastructure of the space, issues around race, record-keeping, and allocation of spaces. He discusses eviction defense, including 13th Street, and the legalization process, beginning with meetings in the early 1990s that did not lead to an agreement on legalization. Biltsted was deeply and consistently involved in the legalization process, and he discusses debates over resale value and affordability and the challenges of dealing with ownership.</p>

                        <p>Tauno Biltsted was born in 1970 in Copenhagen, Denmark, to a Danish father and a Turkish/Canadian mother, and grew up in a hippie neighborhood in Vancouver. At age 13 his family returned to Copenhagen in search of work, and two years later they moved to East 3rd Street in New York. As a teenager he was into punk rock music and culture, and while in Copenhagen he was involved with the squatting scene there. In 1989 Biltsted moved into C-Squat in 1989 following the Tompkins Square riots. It was mostly young people, but not yet all punk rock, and included expatriate Hungarians. He was interested in taking over spaces and people running them as models for how to live in community. Biltsted later went to Europe to experience the squatting scene there in 1991-1992, and when he returned to New York he was voted into Umbrella House.</p>

                        <p>In this interview Thadeaus Umpster discusses the many different squatted buildings he lived in, and his experience opening up several buildings (including in other parts of New York and other cities across the country) that lasted on average six months to two years. Umpster discusses his political involvements, especially with the organization Food Not Bombs, and the ways in which his activist work intertwined with the squatting scene.

                        <p>Maggie Wrigley's interview describes the beauty and brutality of New York and the Lower East Side in the 1980s. Wrigley, who lived at Bullet Space, describes doing work days, being voted in at a meeting, and discusses how the squatter made decisions about allocating space over time. She describes the cold of those first winters, the violent atmosphere, doing work on the building, and the community of squatters and supporters. She also describes both tense and friendly relationships with their neighbors on the block. Wrigley talks about the 13th Street evictions, the defense of Umbrella House, and defending their building with barricades and petitions from the city and from non-profit housing groups. Wrigley discusses how squatters were demonized, and how they proved their good intentions by securing permanent affordable housing in the neighborhood. She also discusses her archives – why she made them, what they contain, and how she has used them. Bullet Space has historically been an artists’ building, and she discusses its evolution as such, and art projects done there over the years, including Steal This Radio and Your House is Mine. Wrigley talks about how the building was run, and how it has changed with legalization. She describes the health impacts of living in a squat. Finally, Wrigley discusses the legalization process, and the challenges of dealing with UHAB and becoming homeowners, including negotiations with Margarita Lopez.</p>
