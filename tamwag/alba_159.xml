        chiefly of letters from six American Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers (Bill "Mike" Bailey,
        Nathan Gross, Harry Hakam, George Kaye, Sydney Levine and William Van Felix) who fought
        together in the Spanish Civil War. Although Polon's correspondents were strangers to her,
        the letters she wrote were clearly important to the men who received them and several of
        them responded in detail to her. The bulk of the letters were written in 1938 and provide
        descriptions of battles, bombardments, and the relationship between the international
        volunteers and the Spanish citizenry as well as commentary on the political situation in the
        United States.</abstract>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Marjorie Polon (1924-1977), a native of New York City, was the daughter of Russian Jewish
        immigrants. Polon's father died when she was an infant and her mother became a schoolteacher
        to support her and her older brother. Polon attended the Walden School in New York City, and
        in 1944 graduated from Vassar College. The topics of her senior thesis were Marx and Freud.
        In November of 1944 Polon married Leon Taunbenhaus with whom she had two daughters. Polon
        was a writer by profession and, according to her daughter Jair Kessler, "life-long leftist"
        who remained committed to progressive politics throughout her life.</p>
      <p>In 1938, in the midst of the Spanish Civil War, then fourteen-year-old Polon began to
        correspond with six American Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers (Bill "Mike" Bailey, Nathan
        Gross, Harry Hakam, George Kaye, Sydney Levine and William Van Felix) who had gone to Spain
        to defend the embattled Republic. Although Marjorie Polon did not know any of these men
        until she began exchanging letters with them, her letters were clearly important to the men
        who received them. Her letters appear to have been passed around among the soldiers; the
        cigarettes and photos Polon included with her letters were especially popular. Although
        Polon's friends and classmates may have been sympathetic to the fight against fascism in
        Spain, apparently none of them joined her in corresponding with the volunteers. All of the
        volunteers with whom Polon corresponded survived the Spanish Civil War.</p>
      <p>Bill Bailey (1910-1995), described by Harry Hakam "as the biggest guy in the battalion,"
        was renowned before his involvement in the Spanish Civil War for removing the Nazi flag, in
        1935, from the S.S. Bremen while it was in port in New York City. Bailey, the son of Irish
        immigrants, lived in Hoboken and New York City until he ran off to sea at the age of
        fourteen. In 1930 he joined the Marine Workers' Industrial Union and shortly thereafter
        became a member of the Communist Party. By the time he began his correspondence with Polon
        he had been in Spain nearly a year as a member of the seamen's machine-gun company. Bailey
        met Polon, and continued to correspond with her, after his return from Spain.</p>
      <p>Nathan Gross (b. 1914), a New York City native and high school graduate, served as a
        machine gunner during the Spanish Civil War. Before fighting in Spain, he was an office
        worker and a union organizer. Although his parents were Democrats, he and his sister,
        Gertrude Richman, a teacher, were Communists.</p>
      <p>Harry Hakam (1913-1996) served in a communications unit with William Van Felix and
        "introduced" Van Felix to Polon. Hakam, a native of Brooklyn and a member of the Young
        Communist League, had two years of college and three years of union courses in electrical
        engineering. He worked as an electrician before volunteering to fight in Spain.</p>
      <p>George Kaye (1918?-1990), who joined the Young Communist League in 1933, was one of the
        youngest American volunteers in Spain. Bill Bailey "adopted" young Kaye into the seamen's
        machine-gun company, and Kaye, who had two years of college, served as editor for Bailey's
        dispatches from the war. Prior to embarking for Spain, Kaye, a native New Yorker, worked as
        a truck driver for a furniture company in Hollywood, California and was a member of the
        Teamsters union. Kaye's parents, Anna and Morris, were communist sympathizers.</p>
      <p>Sydney Levine (b. 1911), a machine gunner during the Spanish Civil War, had been a member
        of the Communist Party since 1933. Levine, who had only a junior high school education
        supplemented by one year of trade school, was a machinist by trade. Levine was born in
        Connecticut but was raised in New York City. His mother, a Russian immigrant, died when he
        was twelve. The other members of Levine's family, a devoutly religious sister, a criminal
        brother sentenced to Sing-Sing, and his father, a Russian immigrant, did not share Levine's
        appreciation of the Communist Party.</p>
      <p>William Van Felix (1916-2002) was a native New Yorker and a radio technician. An Italian
        submarine torpedoed the ship that carried Van Felix and other volunteers from Marseilles to
        Barcelona in 1937. Many casualties ensued; however Spanish fishermen rescued Van Felix as he
        swam for shore. Van Felix was assigned to a communications unit in Spain. When standard
        communication systems broke down, he served as a runner to deliver messages.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The collection consists chiefly of correspondence to Marjorie Polon from six American
        Abraham Lincoln Brigade volunteers (Bill "Mike" Bailey, Nathan Gross, Harry Hakam, George
        Kaye, Sydney Levine and William Van Felix) who fought together in the Spanish Civil War. The
        majority of the letters in the collection were written by Bill Bailey. Bailey's letters from
        Spain describe the training of Spanish recruits; relationships between the international
        volunteers and the Spanish citizenry; air raids; battle scenes and conditions in Barcelona,
        Ebro, Fatarella, and Gandesa; and provide commentary on the political situation in the
        United States. Bailey's later letters include descriptions of his work as a seaman in the
        South Pacific and as editor of the Black Gang News; Voice of the Rank and File of the Marine
        Firemen for Democratic Unionism.</p>
      <p>Nathan Gross's letter, written after a bombardment, highlights the value the volunteers
        placed on the cigarettes Polon sent to the volunteers. The letters from Harry Hakam indicate
        that he helped Polon expand her group of "pen pals." He also encouraged Polon to send more
        letters and cigarettes, and to write to the Spanish soldiers as well as to the Americans.
        Sydney Levine disabused Polon of any "romantic" notions she held of Spain, and included
        descriptions of aerial bombings and life in the field. William Van Felix also described life
        in the field, and wrote of the importance of letters to the volunteers. This collection also
        includes one letter in Spanish from a soldier identified only as "Ernesto" and one copy of
        The Volunteer for Liberty annotated by William Van Felix.</p>
      <p>Of special interest, beyond the content of the letters in the collection, are the two
        postcards included as part of a 1938 letter by Bailey, and the graphics on the Black Gang
        News; Voice of the Rank and File of the Marine Firemen for Democratic Unionism letterhead on
        which the 1952 letter from Bailey is written.</p>
