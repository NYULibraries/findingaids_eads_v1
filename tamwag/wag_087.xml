He began by handling a union insurgency case which then led to others, so that his practice was almost entirely comprised of representing rank-and-file members suing to protect their democratic rights within their unions. The collection principally consists of legal case files, including affidavits, depositions, motions, District Court and appellate briefs, exhibits, appendices, transcripts and correspondence. The collection provides a wealth of information about the politics and culture of rank-and-file organizing.</abstract>

    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Burton Hall (1929-1991) was born in South Orange, New Jersey in 1929. He graduated from Williams College in 1951 and Yale Law School in 1954. While in college and law school, Hall was a member of the Food, Tobacco and Agricultural Workers Union in Camden, New Jersey, the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, Local 11, and the International Association of Machinists, Local 751, on the West Coast. He served in the U.S. Army from 1954 to 1956. He was admitted to the New York bar in 1957 and worked as a lawyer for a private firm and the Federal Aviation Agency before turning to labor law.</p><p>Hall set up his own practice in 1960 as a labor lawyer. Unintentionally at first, he found himself handling a union insurgency case which then led to others, so that his practice was almost entirely comprised of representing rank-and-file members suing to protect their democratic rights within their unions.</p><p>His office was located at 136 Liberty Street in Lower Manhattan. When the building was demolished to make way for the World Trade Center, he moved to 401 Broadway. His firm, Hall, Clifton &amp; Schwartz, formed in 1980. Wendy Sloan became an associate in 1982 and the firm of Hall &amp; Sloan was formed in 1984.</p><p>Hall was one of the pioneer attorneys in developing the case law for the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act. His precedent-setting cases involved protection of the rights guaranteed by law in the section of the Act known as the "Bill of Rights" of union members. For instance, in Salzhandler v. Caputo, one of the earliest of the many disciplinary cases litigated by Hall for members of the Painters' Union, Hall articulated the right of free speech in unions in broad and unequivocal terms. Salzhandler was the first of many landmark cases which established legal protection for the rights of union members. Hall represented rank-and-filers in numerous cases involving issues such as eligibility for running for union office, discipline against members for criticism of their leadership, and expulsion of union members for advocating radical political ideas.</p><p>Burton Hall died in 1991 at age 61.</p><p>Bibliography:</p><p><list><item>Autocracy and Insurgency in Organized Labor. ed.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>This collection documents approximately thirty years of the union democracy movement, from the 1960s to the 1990s. It provides an opportunity to examine the development of a significant portion of the case law which gave meaning and substance to the rights guaranteed by the Landrum-Griffin Act, also known as the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The legal records, include affidavits, depositions, motions, District Court and appellate briefs, exhibits, appendices, transcripts, and correspondence. These materials provide a wealth of information about the politics and culture of rank-and-file organizing in general and rank-and-file organizing within specific unions. Additionally, the newspapers, flyers, programs, platforms, campaign literature, reports, annotated minutes, correspondence, and a small number of photographs provide a rich data base for documenting the vital sub-culture of union insurgents, as many of the cases stemmed from an individual who was part of some organized opposition group. </p><p>Of particular note is the correspondence found in the collection. Burton Hall maintained a lively correspondence with those he represented. The letters from John Cole, Seafarer (Cole v. Paul Hall, SIU); Harold Robbins, Painter, District Council 9 (former bodyguard to Trotsky); and those to the plaintiffs in Gordon v. Winpisinger (IAM) are outstanding examples. The collection contains a vast amount of correspondence wherein Hall would lay out a legal argument, either to a Judge sitting on one of his cases, to the opposing Counsel, or to one of the many attorneys who wrote seeking his expert advice, or copies of his briefs.</p>  </scopecontent>

Burton Hall served as an advisor to efforts to reform the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) from its earliest days, and this series documents his contributions to the Professional Drivers Council (PROD), Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), and F.O.R.E. (Fear of Reprisal Ends). The correspondence between principals such as Steve Early (PROD), Arthur Fox (PROD), and Ken Paff (TDU) is especially interesting for its consideration of strategies. Of the numerous cases represented in the collection (filed numerically by Local), interest centers on the myriad manipulations of the members and the response to these manipulations at the international level.</p><p>This series also richly documents significant cases within the construction trades. Certain of the Teamster locals fall within this category as well, such as Local 272 of the IBT. The Interim Report on "Corruption and Racketeering in the NYC Construction Industry," cited in the bibliography, is replete with references to cases litigated by Hall (Carpenters, Laborers, Steamfitters, Housewreckers, IBT Local 272).</p><p>The seafaring unions provided another disproportionate share of clients. Both East and West Coast Longshoremen were represented by Burton Hall, and the jurisdictional tangles between the various seafaring unions represented in the collection provides an inside look at the "maritime jungle." Their "robust unionism" is well represented in the vast amount of literature and correspondence produced in the course of their struggles.</p><p>There are also legal case files from unions in the transportation and entertainment industries, particularly the Transport Workers Union (TWU); the International Association of Machinists (IAM); the American Federation of Musicians (AFM); the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Operators (IATSE); and National Association of Broadcast Employees &amp; Technicians (NABET). Additionally, cases involving the International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU); the National Union of Hospital &amp; Health Care Employees, District 1199; and numerous other unions are also present in this series.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref48" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries A: International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT)</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref49" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Local 111, American Communications Association</unittitle><unitdate normal="1981/1981" type="inclusive">1981</unitdate><container id="aspace_4f59e1d721052ba9633545df0bf238f5" label="Mixed Materials (31142040587563)" type="Box">2</container><container parent="aspace_4f59e1d721052ba9633545df0bf238f5" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref50" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>Local 138;
