<p>Larry Racioppo (1947- ) was born in Brooklyn, NY. A New York City-based photographer, his work focuses on the urban landscape. Racioppo had his first solo exhibition in 1977 at Brooklyn's f-stop gallery, and in 1980 published his first book of photographs,<emph render="italic"> Halloween</emph>.</p><p>Racioppo worked as the official photographer for New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) from 1989 to 2011.  He was hired by HPD to document the city's rebuilding of its distressed neighborhoods, from Bedford Stuyvesant to Harlem to the South Bronx. </p><p>When he received a Guggenheim Fellowship in Photography in 1997, Racioppo took a leave from HPD to create a series of panoramic urban landscapes. He returned to HPD to coordinate an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York documenting the agency's work. While continuing to photograph for HPD, Racioppo had solo exhibitions of two in-depth personal projects: <emph render="italic">Forgotten Gateway: The Abandoned Buildings of Ellis Island</emph> at the National Building Museum, and <emph render="italic">The Word on The Street</emph> at the Museum of Biblical Art.The New-York Historical Society commissioned Racioppo to document St.Paul's Chapel during its use as a relief center after the Sept.11, 2001 terrorist attacks. </p><p>Racioppo's work is also held at the Museum of the City of New York, The Brooklyn Museum, the Brooklyn Public Library, El Museo del Barrio, and the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum.</p>  </bioghist>

He was hired by HPD in 1989 to document the city's rebuilding of its distressed neighborhoods in all five boroughs. The subjects of these photos include demolition, construction, and before and after images of rehabilitated apartment buildings and playgrounds.  There are also portraits of tenants in their apartments, squatters, homeless people, building managers, building superintendents, construction workers, HPD staff and program participants, and city and state officials such as Mayor Edward Koch, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and Governor Mario Cuomo.  This series also contains many photos of dilapidated buildings (interior and exterior), unsafe living conditions, evictions, crack house interiors, drug paraphernalia, and graffiti.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_5f03ee997928177e64c8f7b0988acc6d"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Series III is arranged by location and/or subject, and then by size.</p></arrangement><acqinfo id="aspace_f3af8088b762624d7cc5871100504eab"><head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head><p>Gift of Larry Racioppo, 2017.
