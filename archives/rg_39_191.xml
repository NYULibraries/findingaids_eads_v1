<p>New York University has had many student newspapers with many different names since its founding. The Heights campus and the Washington Square campus had separate student newspapers until 1973 when the Heights campus was closed. The Evening Division was the designation for students who took night classes at Washington Square College. The newspaper was published under three titles: Guess (1926), Nite News (1927-1932), and Washington Square College Evening News (1933-1967).</p>  </bioghist>
