    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Mae Kaplan Millstone (1913-2009) graduated with a Master's degree in Sociology from Pennsylvania State University in 1934, and worked during the mid-1930s for the National Industrial Recovery Administration as a Special Investigator through the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. She moved to Detroit in 1936 where she met Harry Millstone (1907-1999), who was a unionizer for the CIO at the time. They married in 1938. In 1941 they moved to Williamsport, Pennsylvania and Mae left the workforce to raise their two children, but continued to volunteer in consumer and voter registration activities. The family moved to York, Pennsylvania in 1961, where Mae became the editor of the women's section for <emph render="italic">The Gazette and Daily</emph> newspaper. She also stayed active in her community by co-founding the group York Action for Peace, and continued her support of the labor movement. She was also active in the York Chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) and volunteered for Planned Parenthood. Harry was employed by Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America for many years as a union organizer and retired in 1973. He continued to educate others, teaching various courses on union organizing at the George Meany Center for Labor Studies during the 1980s. In 1999 he received the Pillar of Labor from the Tamiment Library and Wagner Labor Archives.</p>  </bioghist>

Early files include a small amount of school papers from the 1920s and 1930s. Reports, charts, and notes in this series document her work in the mid-1930s as an investigator for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry Bureau of Women and Children regarding work environments and compliance. Mae's engagement calendars include daily entries of her life and work dating from 1959 to 2005. This series also includes Russian and Chinese language class papers, exercises, and audio recordings. Mae's scrapbook in this series contains women's sections of the York, Pennsylvania <emph render="italic">The Gazette and Daily</emph> from 1962, which was early in her tenure as editor. The subject files in this series were accumulated by Mae during the 1970s, either for use as part of her editing work or as personal reference files. These files reflect issues Mae perceived as affecting and impacting women, including affirmative action, contraception, the Equal Rights Amendement (ERA), feminism, health, religion, sports, and gender descrimination in the workplace. Her files include material on issues that not only affected her directly, but also affected women of color, and women living and working in countries outside the United States including China, Central America, South America, and Japan. These files typically contain press clippings, booklets, and brochures, and include a 1971 copy of <emph render="italic">Our Bodies, Ourselves</emph>. Mae's involvement in the national and York Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) is illustrated through her collection of organizational publications, photographs, event notices, and print material dating from the 1970s to 1980s. An event program and planning notes for a 1998 banquet in her honor hosted by the York Chapter of NOW is also in this series. Other honors and awards include a 1947 War Service Award for her work serving on the U.S. Office of Price Administration Labor Advisory Committee; and a parade program for her role as Grand Marshall for the 2005 York Labor Day Parade. Of particular note in this series is a digital recording of a 6.5 hour long 2005 video interview conducted by her son, David Millstone, in which Mae reflects on her personal life, work, and life-long activism in support of women's issues, world peace, and the labor movement.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_01d46e5c671a91a0d7f734396f4a9b55"><head>Processing Information</head><p>Select creator-supplied titles containing sexist language were identified in this series, but have been retained to convey important contextual information regarding time and place in which the documents and titles were created.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_d1cd051259c66ff888e39dd303aca322" level="file"><did><unittitle>Early School Class Papers</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1920/1939" type="inclusive">1920s-1930s</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_51b68c56a2dd5a5c86f4ec73003a3a4d" label="Mixed Materials [31142067204381]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_51b68c56a2dd5a5c86f4ec73003a3a4d" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_496ca61002741d7b2f484abc10c592ea" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry Bureau of Women and Children – Home-Work Compliance Investigations with Charts, Notes, Reports, Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1935/1937" type="inclusive">1935-1937</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_3ede1d9baf5ced4209f7fb76fd103111" label="Mixed Materials [31142067204381]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_3ede1d9baf5ced4209f7fb76fd103111" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_66bfc31c646d128e8c6c38038ea1846d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Job Searches -- Correspondence, References</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1935/1945" type="inclusive">1935-1945</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_24baebc289b6e29364b3b1185d901999" label="Mixed Materials [31142067204381]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_24baebc289b6e29364b3b1185d901999" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_af360fe8a85e03f4e64cb1217d612b37" level="file"><did><unittitle>Publications -- <emph render="italic"> International Press Correspondence</emph></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1935/1937" type="inclusive">1935-1937</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_fdc1ee49ffb2f2a5949fb5f1c921e4df" label="Mixed Materials [31142067204381]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_fdc1ee49ffb2f2a5949fb5f1c921e4df" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_6d339637a6a39e912cc4bd5dce1f9d22" level="file"><did><unittitle>Publications -- <emph render="italic">IPA News Bulletin</emph></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1936/1936" type="inclusive">1936</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_2f7ff9684b7e182db00375a3f49f5893" label="Mixed Materials [31142067204381]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_2f7ff9684b7e182db00375a3f49f5893" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_64e425e5e7ac7cefdf9fdf939fa101af" level="file"><did><unittitle>Publications -- <emph render="italic">In Fact</emph></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1944/1944" type="inclusive">1944</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_811bd9dcbbd58cb8c61037500b32e275" label="Mixed Materials [31142067204381]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_811bd9dcbbd58cb8c61037500b32e275" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a77df7ed831471ed288f00a3f664aa6b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Publications -- <emph render="italic">The Minority of One</emph></unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1964/1964" type="inclusive">1964</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box - Legal" id="aspace_78a613dd941067fc3aeeda72138c2d4b" label="Mixed Materials [31142067204381]" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_78a613dd941067fc3aeeda72138c2d4b" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_fc675936289d425bc5af1060a11dd7c8" level="file"><did><unittitle>Publications -- <emph render="italic">I.

His early files date from the mid-1940s, and document his time serving in the Army Service Forces at Camp Lee. These files include camp fact sheets, orientation newsletters, training manuals, and bulletins. Harry also wrote articles and presentations related to labor unions and organizing in the late 1950s-early 1960s including an analysis of the Playtex organizing drive and a radio script of a panel discussion he hosted for Wise Potato Chips. A large portion of this series is union organizing-focused fliers, bulletins, and handouts from the 1960s and early 1970s that were distributed by Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America. Some of this print material focused on specific organizing committees for companies including Heinz, Playtex, and Ore-Ida. A plaque for his 1973 retirement and cufflinks and tie clip from Amalgamated are also in this series. Harry also taught instructional courses in the 1980s at the George Meany Center for Labor Studies, and this series contains course manuals for topics including white collar organizing, collective bargaining, and advanced organizing techniques.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_242ed32347dd6bd2cbc16473c437c455" level="file"><did><unittitle>Army Service Forces at Camp Lee -- Training Packets, Fact Sheets, Booklets</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1942/1945" type="inclusive">1942-1945</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
