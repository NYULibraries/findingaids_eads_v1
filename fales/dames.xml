            <head>Historical Note</head>
            <p>Les Dames d'Escoffier, New York (LDENY), is a society of professional women involved in the food, wine, and hospitality industries. It was founded in honor of Auguste Escoffier, whom Les Dames' mission statement credits with having "single-handedly brought the culinary art into the modern era." Escoffier "elevated the role of cooks from that of laborers to artists;" when he died, he "left the world a new art, that of dining." Les Dames d'Escoffier was founded in New York in 1976. With expansion to other cities, Les Dames d'Escoffier International (LDEI) was formed in 1985 to operate as an umbrella organization. Membership is by invitation only and exclusive to women who have distinguished themselves in the respective fields with which Les Dames is concerned. Les Dames organizes various food-related activities throughout the year, the majority of which are dinners; new members are inducted during the "annual gala dinners." Les Dames' major philanthropic activity consists of promoting the education and advancement of women in careers related to food industries. The society provides scholarships for women desiring to become professionals or to advance their skills in the fields of food, wine, other beverages, nutrition, the arts of the table and related disciplines.</p>

            <p>The collection includes dinner menus, invitation cards, and promotional materials, for example, press releases and newspaper clippings, from various dinner events organized by Les Dames d'Escoffier, New York. The collection also includes the correspondence of individual LDENY members, as well as correspondence from individuals and institutions connected with the organization. The collection also includes the Les Dames d'Escoffier newsletter "Journal," as well as several issues of "Reporter," the newsletter produced by LDENY's umbrella organization, Les Dames d'Escoffier International. Administrative material generated by the day-to-day activities of running an organization, such as meeting minutes and financial statements are also included in the collection. Visual documentation of events in the form of photographs and videorecordings are also included. Almost every series in the collection contains both Les Dames d'Escoffier New York and Les Dames d'Escoffier International material; the LDENY material has been grouped toward the beginning of each series and the LDEI material toward the end of each series. Oversize material from each of the series is described at the end of the finding ais.</p>

                    <p>Series V contains LDENY members' correspondence, as well as that of other people variously connected with the organization. The correspondence of individual correspondents has been arranged alphabetically, last name(s) first. In cases where only one item of correspondence issued from a particular correspondent, the item in question was placed, along with other similar items, in one folder. In the case of multiple items issuing from the same correspondent, these were placed in a single folder bearing the name of the correspondent. Subseries A contains letters with collective addressees (Ex., "Dear Dame(s)..."). Subseries B contains memos. Subseries C contains letters written to and from Les Dames members on the topic of the Membership Roster of 1984, subseries D on the topic of the Les Dames' scholarships, and subseries E on the topic of the Les Dames' Dinner Events.</p>
