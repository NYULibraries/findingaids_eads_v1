    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Corporate Administration at Time Inc. includes the president, chief executive officer, chairman of the board, and chairman of the executive committee; vice presidents whose function only seems to exist at the corporate level (Peter Costiglio); executives overseeing multiple areas of the company (Charles Bear); and staff on special assignment at the corporate level (Otto Fuerbringer and William Rukeyser). Corporate Administration also includes corporate finance, the corporate secretary, and corporate strategy staff.</p><p>Executives at Time Inc. often held multiple positions over time, or concurrently, and kept their files all together without separation by position or office. Executives sometimes held staff positions along with board positions. The corporate finance department included the treasurer and assistant treasurers. The corporate secretary often was also the comptroller. </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The majority of General Files were processed by Holly Deakyne and Samantha Brown from 2016 to 2018. Brown processed Stock, and Deakyne processed Contract, Corporate, and Corporate Secretary Legal Files; Dead Companies; Five-Year Plans; Notary Seals; Patents; Printing Agreements; Subsidiary Corporate Books; and Time Warner Corporate Structure Books. Deakyne processed Bound Books of Sales or Acquisitions, Executive Committees Files, and Stock Option Agreements in 2021. The original folders were retained when present although some documents were transferred to archival containers in instances of overcrowding or transferred from hanging files. The Executive Committees Files were rehoused from manila envelopes. Order was imposed on all series except Dead Companies, Executive Committees Files, and Notary Seals. Deakyne created the inventory and other descriptive notes for this series. </p><p>The Roy E. Larsen Files were processed by Deakyne in 2017. The Larsen files aside from the Post Office presentation slides were found interspersed among unfiled Editor-in-Chief Hedley Donovan files and were separated by the archivist. The files were originally in a drawer in the Time Inc. Archives with no label. The slides were with other loose unfiled materials. The original folders were retained although some documents were transferred to archival containers in instances of overcrowding or if no housing existed. Deakyne created the inventory and other descriptive notes for this series. Prior to N-YHS receiving the Time Inc Archive, these files appear to have had initial processing by the Time Inc. Archives in the form of marking, cross reference sheets, and some relabeling in preparation for inclusion in one of the assembled collections.

<p>This finding aid relates to just one record group of the Time Inc. Records. For information about the other record groups and for overall information about the archives, please see the Guide to the Time Inc. Records (MS 3009). The Henry Luce Papers (MS 3014) were acquired with the Time Inc. Records. The collection of books acquired with the records are cataloged as the Time Inc. Reference Library.</p><p>Due to the small number of Roy Larsen files, it is probable that the majority of his records ended up in one of the Time Inc. assembled collections, such as the Time Inc. Subject Files (MS 3009-RG 1) and the Time Inc. Bio Files (MS 3009-RG 2), or in his donation to Harvard.</p><p>Files from J. Richard Munro while he was president of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Time Inc. are located in his subject files in the Time Inc. Video Group Records (MS 3009-RG 41). His subject files spanned from his time as Video Group Vice President through CEO, but the majority related to his GVP role.</p><p>Additional records on all departments, offices, or staff can be found in the Time Inc. Subject Files (MS 3009-RG 1), the Time Inc. Bio Files (MS 3009-RG 2), the Time Inc. Reference Files (MS 3009-RG 3), and the Time Inc. Annex Files (MS 3009-RG 39).</p>  </relatedmaterial>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The Corporate Administration Records contain files from the corporate-level offices and executives of Time Inc. Executives and offices represented include the president, chief executive officer, chairman of the board, and chairman of the executive committee; corporate secretary; the finance division including files from the treasurer and investor relations; executive vice presidents; vice presidents overseeing administration, international, communications, and newspaper acquisitions; and a director of international business. </p><p>Staff represented include Roy E. Larsen, one of the first employees of Time Inc., the first employee of Time magazine, and credited as the third most important person, after the cofounders, in building Time Inc. as a company; James A. Linen; Andrew Heiskell; Ralph P. Davidson; Reginald K. Brack, Jr.; and Don Logan. Executive staff files sometimes document their philanthropic or volunteer work outside of Time Inc., including with the Prince of Songkla University in Thailand, the American Corporate Aid for Lebanon Inc., the National Urban League, and St. Bernard's School. Corporate management primarily handled corporate strategic planning for Time Inc., required corporate filings, Time Inc. stock and other stock investments, and major acquisitions, sales, or mergers including the merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications creating Time Warner. Of interest are internal memoranda distributed to the "War List" during World War II in Treasurer Charles Stillman's files.</p><p>The General Files include corporate-level records where the exact office of origination is not known, or the files are from several people or offices at the corporate executive level, but were grouped together by Time Inc. at some point. Records include stock certificates, five-year plans, notary seals, patents owned by Time Inc., printing agreements, and corporate books or other organizational records from affiliates and subsidiaries of Time Inc.</p>  </scopecontent>

Larsen was one of the first employees of Time Inc., the first employee of <title render="italic">Time</title> magazine, and is credited as being the third most important person, after the cofounders Henry R. Luce and Briton Hadden, in building Time Inc. as a company. Hadden hired Larsen as <title render="italic">Time</title> circulation manager in 1922. After Hadden's death in 1929, Larsen also became the general manager of Time Inc. and attained the title of vice president, making him Luce's deputy on the business side. During the 1937 decentralization of the magazines, Larsen was named publisher of <title render="italic">Life</title>. When Luce resigned as president and chief executive officer in 1939, he nominated Larsen as his replacement making Larsen the head of the business side of Time Inc. Larsen spent 21 years as president. In 1960 Luce and Larsen designed another reorganization of the company which replaced Larsen as president and Luce as editor-in-chief. This reorganization also created an executive commitee of which Larsen headed as chairman. When Luce died in 1967, Larsen was one of the only non-family members to sit on the board of the Henry Luce Foundation. Larsen moved from chairman of the executive committee to vice-chairman of Time Inc.'s board of directors in 1969. He held this role until his retirement in 1979 at the age of 80.</p><p>While employed at Time Inc., Larsen gifted his copies of <title render="italic">Time</title> correspondents dispatches to Harvard University's archives.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>Barron, James.

Larsen Files document his time as Time Inc. president, chairman of the executive committee and vice-chairman of the board. Some records date from his earlier roles. </p><p>His files contain memoranda and correspondence to and from cofounder and Editor-in-Chief Henry R. Luce and early Time Inc. executives including David Brumbaugh, Charles Gleason, C. D. Jackson, Harry Phillips, Dick Thomas, and Edward K. Thompson. Items of interest include a recollection by another company's employee of an encounter with William Faulkner (<title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title> folder on Tom O'Reilly); photographs of Larsen and former United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower at a Freedoms Foundation event; letters from education professionals about their boycott of <title render="italic">Time</title> and <title render="italic">Life</title>; condolence letters upon Luce's death; photographs of Marilyn Monroe at the 1957 event commemorating the construction of the new Time &amp; Life Building at Rockefeller Center; and memoranda on staff changes, the Finance Committee, corporate image, and the creation and status of the film and medical departments along with photographs of the board in the Time Inc. miscellaneous file. </p><p>The files include some cross-reference sheets from the Time Inc. Archives referring to "Lillian" and "dds," and the transfer of the files. Lillian is Time Inc. archivist Lillian Owens, and dds is D. D. Smith, Larsen's executive assistant at the time of his retirement.</p><p>Due to the small number of Larsen files remaining, it is probable that the majority of his records ended up in one of the Time Inc. assembled collections, likely throughout the Time Inc. Subject Files (MS 3009-RG 1), or in his donation to Harvard University. Extensive memoranda sent to him as part of the War List during World War II was removed around 1954 for inclusion in Charles Stillman's files in this record group.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_fc69939480461d5586bb11a21355dd63"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Organized alphabetically with order imposed by the archivist.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref180_cb9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ad Age</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1973</unitdate><container id="aspace_03a0131478c010b747a21eba7be10957" label="Mixed Materials [10170000011378]" type="Offsite-Box">782</container><container parent="aspace_03a0131478c010b747a21eba7be10957" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref181_cr9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Agee, Jim</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1957</unitdate><container id="aspace_a71951ae4aaadda19ce4400918f1fc9a" label="Mixed Materials [10170000011378]" type="Offsite-Box">782</container><container parent="aspace_a71951ae4aaadda19ce4400918f1fc9a" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref182_0cr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Dr. W.

The General Speeches folder includes some speeches prior to his appointment as chairman. It also contains a transcript of his support for a bill to enact the Fair Housing Act of 1967 ("Title IV of the civil rights bill S-1358"). His speeches include testimony to Congressional committees, key notes at university commencements and advertisers conventions, and speeches on the topics of economic issues such as urban housing and cost of living and freedom of the press. As Heiskell is cited as a founder of the National Urban Coalition and co-chair from 1967 to 1979, many of his speeches may have been in this role.</p><p>Citation:</p><p>"The 1993 Frankel Awards." <title render="italic">Humanities</title>, National Endowment for the Humanities, November/December 1993.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_8b8ccd4108e52fbab6613eccb5d577a8"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Organized chronologically based on original order.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_0070e1982e571bfbd7a92aa48c850dc6" level="file"><did><unittitle>List of Speeches 1940-1980</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1980?</unitdate><container id="aspace_8dbeb1febca7c2d35006705ce03e2b96" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010548]" type="Offsite-Box">581</container><container parent="aspace_8dbeb1febca7c2d35006705ce03e2b96" type="Folder">1-2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a2f558f9001c0f6f8246bc4dd5942063" level="file"><did><unittitle>General Speeches</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1949-1967</unitdate><container id="aspace_979a38ebec80870089f1eb52c7c23cd4" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010548]" type="Offsite-Box">581</container><container parent="aspace_979a38ebec80870089f1eb52c7c23cd4" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_360bcb63b6f43f9871eab861c475c2af" level="file"><did><unittitle>1968 January 17: Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_6975305d940b94a62e996156804870b1" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010548]" type="Offsite-Box">581</container><container parent="aspace_6975305d940b94a62e996156804870b1" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_c209d1d5f7bc6f066c35d1abd2beabd6" level="file"><did><unittitle>1968 March 15: Senate Banking and Currency Committee on Proposed Housing Legislation:</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_e7ababb6c73cca19a2abff220b352b46" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010548]" type="Offsite-Box">581</container><container parent="aspace_e7ababb6c73cca19a2abff220b352b46" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ea8631c1c24b4532555f26df9707d73a" level="file"><did><unittitle>1968 April 17: United Negro College Fund: Detroit, Michigan</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_f690b122aa44804fb1a97a6e7f5bef6c" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010548]" type="Offsite-Box">581</container><container parent="aspace_f690b122aa44804fb1a97a6e7f5bef6c" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_34923680efe99076638d8600d48e9be7" level="file"><did><unittitle>1968 April 24: National Conference of Christians and Jews: Kansas City, Missouri</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_b7a289f6c50125123a90eeaaa074d449" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010548]" type="Offsite-Box">581</container><container parent="aspace_b7a289f6c50125123a90eeaaa074d449" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_28af8604ee0c4c72a975390e296b82a6" level="file"><did><unittitle>1968 May 14: Founders Day Dinner of Indiana Chapter of Sigma Delta Chi</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_37999f8044ccd69c823a7aad05b6f980" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010548]" type="Offsite-Box">581</container><container parent="aspace_37999f8044ccd69c823a7aad05b6f980" type="Folder">8</container></did></c><c id="aspace_3337886dd78e24ed5f1e070d6cc6a04f" level="file"><did><unittitle>1968 May 14: WFBM and Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_3031e7026e34514fec7b7c009baf04c6" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010548]" type="Offsite-Box">581</container><container parent="aspace_3031e7026e34514fec7b7c009baf04c6" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a33bdf4f207f4f0826a9a76401f745bd" level="file"><did><unittitle>1968 May 23: Investment Analysts Society of Chicago</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1968</unitdate><container id="aspace_6af5ffd2f3bca5b69f386a6803d2840e" label="Mixed Materials [10170000010548]" type="Offsite-Box">581</container><container parent="aspace_6af5ffd2f3bca5b69f386a6803d2840e" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_8de27e7bea4d59f34408c02248b222bc" level="file"><did><unittitle>1968 May 23: Cornerstone Ceremony for the Time &amp;

He shortly was promoted to assistant treasurer. In 1930 he was elected the treasurer of Time Inc. Beginning in January 1949, he was both an executive vice president of the company as well as treasurer. Stillman joined the Time Inc. board of directors in 1948. From 1960 to 1968, he served as the chairman of the finance committee. Stillman retired from Time Inc. in 1970, but remained an advisory director to the board.</p><p>Stillman took leave from Time Inc. for six months beginning in June 1948 to head the Technical Survey Mission for the China Aid Program at the request of the United States Economic Cooperation Administrator.</p><p>Citation:</p><p>Time Inc.

Larsen. A note from the Time Inc. Archives accompanying the files says, "Retain these folders intact for Mr. Stillman." indicating that the Archives considered these Stillman's records although they were collected from other sources.</p><p>Most of his interoffice memoranda are to the "War List" during World War II reporting on or giving commentary about financial, commodities, and labor issues during and due to the war, particularly issues that may affect Time Inc. or its subsidiaries and associated foreign publishers. The folder with memoranda from 1939 includes a list of staff on the various War Lists. Some memoranda include attachments of reports and other materials from outside organizations such as the Roundtable on National Defense and The Army Industrial College. There is also a small amount of correspondence during his work for the Economic Cooperation Administration.</p><p>Some material was found loose and some was in existing folders. While the loose material could originally have been part of one of the folders, it has been house separately to maintain the original order since it isn't clear if some of the records were originally from Stillman.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_0234e117ee631283cfef21e4cc9f973e"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Organized alphabetically with arrangement imposed.

Paul Klein served as President of CTI from 1971 to 1974. In 1974, Klein resigned as president and became chairman of the CTI board. Austin Furst succeeded him leaving his roles as senior vice president and chief operating officer of CTI. Furst later became the head of Time-Life Films.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_52d3458a3628936119488a34b8296a0b"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>The Computer Television Inc.

He became president and chief executive officer (CEO) of HBO in March 1973 and then chairman of HBO in May 1976. In August of 1979, Time Inc. appointed Levin as the group vice president of video, overseeing Time-Life Films and HBO along with other cable operations and interests including American Television and Communications Corporation (ATC). In March 1984 Levin was named an executive vice president of Time Inc. making him the chief strategist. In July 1988 the Time Inc. board of directors elected him as a member and named him vice chairman of Time Inc. In this role Levin pursued alternative strategies for all areas of the company. During his time as vice chairman, he was one of the executives managing the merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications, Inc. that created Time Warner. After the merger, he retained his vice chairman title. </p><p>In January 1991, the board elected him as chairman of Time Warner. A few months later, the board named him chief operating officer handling media and entertainment business operations. In February 1992 Levin joined Steven J. Ross as co-CEO of Time Warner and replaced N. J. Nicholas, Jr. as president. Upon Ross's death in December of that year, Levin became the sole CEO. AT that time he reorganized the board to have fewer "insiders" or those employed by Time Warner as well as decreasing the overall number of members. By January 1993, the board elected Levin as chairman; he retained his titles as CEO and president. </p><p>Under Levin's leadership, Time Warner and America Online (AOL) announced a merger (which was really an acquisition of Time Warner by AOL) in early 2000. The deal was made right before the internet stock bubble burst. This ended up being a difficult merger resulting in falling stock value and extensive cost cutting the new AOL Time Warner company. By October 2003, the company returned to its former name of Time Warner. Levin announced his retirement from Time Warner in December 2001 and left the company in May 2002.</p><p>Citation:</p><p>Time Inc. Bio Files, MS 3009-RG 2, New-York Historical Society.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_cd43d883f71b7a5f25a049b218167da6"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>The majority of Gerald Levin's files date from his role as executive vice president (EVP) of strategy and development at the corporate level and vice chairman of Time Inc. overseeing strategy. His files were stored in the Time Inc. Archives as "corporate strategy" and include a mix of files from his time as HBO chairman, group vice president of video, EVP of strategy, and vice chairman of Time Inc. through the Time Inc. and Warner Communications merger. As they were found in the archives intermingled, they remain that way. The majority of Levin's files from his earlier roles with Video Group are in the Time Inc. Video Group Records (MS 3009-RG 41).</p><p>The Administrative Files and Confidential Files of Levin's records document his work on defining the corporate mission; company restructuring; possible partnerships or ventures with other companies, including internationally; and his work on the Time Inc. and Warner communications merger. Records include correspondence with other companies; interoffice memoranda; presentations to the Board; notes on meetings for the Board, analysts, the Time Inc. annual meeting, and various conferences and company retreats; budgets; research on media industries; and transcripts and background information of speeches.</p><p>The series Confidential Files retains the name the files had while in the Time Inc. Archives storage, but does not indicate restrictions. While there is no material difference from the Administrative Files, the Confidential Files remain in a separate series to document the division his office made during the transfer. Confidential Files are Levin's files on Time Inc.'s mergers and considered mergers with other companies, mainly the Time Warner merger. Some documents and original folder titles used code names for various companies such as "Gulf" for Gannett, "Tango" for Time Inc., and "Wonder" for Warner Communications. The use of "Gulf" for Gannett does not appear to have any relation to his files reviewing the possible acquisition of Gulf and Western Industries. Materials found inside the file titled "ABC-CBS" include notes on discussions with Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_2008d15ad834303f263ec73767de1f16"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Organized into two subsubseries: Subsubseries V.A.1.a.

Nicholas, Jr.'s files are a collection of reports and presentations from a short time period of corporate strategizing conducted by the Strategy Committee which looks like it was led by Nicholas and Bruce Hiland. These files were behind a tab labeled "Chapter I material." Some files in Winston Cox's files were behind a "Chapter Two" tab. It can be assumed those files are a continuation of the strategy begun with Nicholas's files. Nicholas's files were found in the same box with some of Cox's.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_b08e7213e9b0201cdc725aa4d4d8a222"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Organized chronologically based on reversing the original loose reverse chronological arrangement.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_6ffd33a1bf7d9f1d2da347901aefc0b2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Corporate Strategy: Introduction</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1981 August</unitdate><container id="aspace_c7ad1b14951e9745a5878572d330ac8a" label="Mixed Materials [10170000016633]" type="Offsite-Box">4260</container><container parent="aspace_c7ad1b14951e9745a5878572d330ac8a" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_84882b9bf2f6d99f07df3fc1d282bb7f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Strategy development</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1981 October</unitdate><container id="aspace_327eb389ebfa141fcc567d0cd2dd6bed" label="Mixed Materials [10170000016633]" type="Offsite-Box">4260</container><container parent="aspace_327eb389ebfa141fcc567d0cd2dd6bed" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_96406501b1588646144491e5f8c70b9b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Corporate strategy: Audit</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1981 September-November</unitdate><container id="aspace_512c7aad6ac2f972c6ceb2776f7295ee" label="Mixed Materials [10170000016633]" type="Offsite-Box">4260</container><container parent="aspace_512c7aad6ac2f972c6ceb2776f7295ee" type="Folder">3-5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b991edb853dc14cc792a09c1de66415d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Corporate strategy: New objectives and strategies</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1982 March</unitdate><container id="aspace_f3f7a9893757724386894a6c59529a39" label="Mixed Materials [10170000016633]" type="Offsite-Box">4260</container><container parent="aspace_f3f7a9893757724386894a6c59529a39" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_430ac1db98a77687dd86f2c6f82b48c5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Strategic planning: Ultimate goal</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" type="inclusive">1982-1983</unitdate><container id="aspace_51f631d2ccb1592c2d0cee7097ed5ff4" label="Mixed Materials [10170000016633]" type="Offsite-Box">4260</container><container parent="aspace_51f631d2ccb1592c2d0cee7097ed5ff4" type="Folder">7</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_dbd4d44dc31684c08c5db73b1a3b833d" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries V.C.

He joined the company as part of a management training program after graduating from Harvard University and began working in the <title render="italic">Time</title> circulation department. He subsequently became assistant business manager of <title render="italic">Time</title> in 1962, business manager in 1964 and general manager in 1968. In 1972, he was appointed director of the newly centralized corporate circulation department and elected as a company Vice President. He served as temporary acting editor of the Magazine Development Group for six months in 1976, after which he was appointed vice president of magazines for the Magazine Group. From 1978 to 1980, he was the publisher of <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title>. </p><p>Sutton returned to the Magazine Group as the group vice president (1980-1984), executive vice president (1984-1985), and finally president and chief executive officer (CEO) (1985-1986). He was also elected to the board of directors of Time Inc. in 1983 and remained a member until his retirement. In December 1986, Sutton exchanged jobs with Reginald Brack and became president and CEO of the Book Group, which signaled a shift away from his previously powerful role within the company. He served in this role until the position was eliminated in 1993 after restructuring within Time Warner. Sutton then served as executive vice president for Time Inc. until his retirement in 1994.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>"Biography. Kelso F. Sutton. Group Vice President, Magazines, Time Inc." Time Inc.

Magazine Group (circa 1976-1986), his time as president and CEO of the Book Group (1986-1993), and his corporate-level work as a Time Inc. executive officer while member of the board of directors (circa 1983-1993) and finally as executive vice president (1993-1994). Because there is some overlap with these four groups, especially for strategic planning files, presentations, and speeches, all of his files were kept together in a single series.</p><p>Across the series, the files contain correspondence, memoranda, administrative and personnel files, group budgets and financial records, research material, strategic planning files, meeting notes, conference files, presentations with slides, and speeches by Sutton and other colleagues.</p><p>The Magazine Group subseries includes acquisition files for Southern Progress Corporation, magazine development files for <title render="italic">Picture Week</title>, <title render="italic">TV-Cable Week</title>, and <title render="italic">Woman</title>, and scripts and audiocassettes for the short-lived <title render="italic">Time World New Service</title> radio program. There are also several folders carried over from Sutton's time at the corporate Circulation Department (1968-1975) for <title render="italic">Life</title>, <title render="italic">Newsweek</title>, and <title render="italic">People</title>, as well as files from the previous Group Vice President Arthur Keylor.</p><p>The Book Group subseries contains correspondence with other publishing companies and book clubs, as well as files about Time Inc. subsidiaries such as Book-of-the-Month Club, Little, Brown and Co., Scott, Foresman and Company, Time-Life Video, and other post-merger Time Warner Publishing entities. There are also several folders retained from his predecessor Reginald Brack.</p><p>The Board of Directors Executive Officer subseries features corporate-level development and strategic planning files, including the work of the Corporate Strategy Group, and files about the Time-Warner merger.</p><p>The Executive Vice President subseries files focus on the Full Service Network, an interactive telecommunications venture by Time Warner.</p><p>There do not appear to be any files from Sutton's brief time as the publisher of <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title> in his files.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_8f478e24904711cdd8bbaf997998be09"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Organized into five subseries:<lb/> 

Subseries VI.A. Magazine Group Files<lb/>
Subseries VI.B. Books Group Files<lb/>
Subseries VI.C. Board of Directors Executive Officer Files<lb/>
Subseries VI.D. Executive Vice President Files<lb/>
Subseries VI.E. Speeches<lb/></p>

<p>Subseries were created by the archivist. Because the original order was inconsistent, files were grouped together based on Sutton's highest positions held over the span of the files. Subseries are organized chronologically by date of the position held. The Speeches subseries spans his positions in both the Magazine and Book groups and was placed at the end.</p>

<p>Files within each subseries are organized alphabetically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_8e8d9623b76f8a8eda1368532cebbe80" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries VI.A.

Luce and was on staff at Time Inc. from 1951 to 1980. Aside from his work at Time Inc., Luce was also the president and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation.</p><p>Luce joined Time Inc. in 1951 as a correspondent. From 1956 to 1960 he was the head of the New Building Department, planning and overseeing the construction of the Time &amp; Life Building at Rockefeller Center. Once the new building opened, Luce held positions in the publisher's offices of <title render="italic">Time</title> and <title render="italic">Fortune</title> before becoming <title render="italic">Fortune</title> Circulation Director in 1961. At this time St. Bernard's School also elected him as its president. It isn't clear how long he held this position although he was a board member of the school for several years before and after. </p><p>In 1964 Luce joined Time Inc. corporate management as the associate director of research and development. From 1966 through 1968 he held positions as the Time-Life News Service London bureau chief and as publisher of <title render="italic">Fortune</title>. From 1969 to 1972, Luce served as <title render="italic">Time</title> publisher. After a short sabbatical, he returned to work in July 1972 as the vice president of corporate planning and remained in this position until his retirement in 1980. </p><p>Citation:</p><p>Time Inc.

Subject files from his role as publisher are in the Time Inc.

Editor-in-Chief Hedley Donovan appointed Otto Fuerbringer as the "chief explorer of Time Inc.'s interests and opportunities in the newspaper field," making him a vice president. Previously Fuerbringer served in several editorial roles at <title render="italic">Time</title> magazine before his promotion to managing editor in 1960. After Time Inc. concluded its exploration of newspapers, Fuerbringer held the first managing editor position in the Magazine Development Group. While head of this group, Time Inc. created and first published <title render="italic">Money</title> and <title render="italic">People</title>. Fuerbringer retired from Time Inc. in September 1973 although it appears he continued to act as a consultant in magazine and newspaper development.</p><p>Prior to Fuerbringer's appointment, others worked on the idea of investing in, acquiring, or starting a newspaper. They include: Director of Corporate Research and Development and Vice President Edgar Baker (1965-1968); a manager in the Comptroller's Office Robert Brody and his assistant N. J. Nicholas, Jr. (1965); Associate Director of Corporate Development Frank White (1968); Time-Life News Service Chief Richard Clurman (1967); <title render="italic">Time</title> Assistant Publisher Putney Westerfield (1967); <title render="italic">Time</title> editor Marshall Loeb; and newspaper task force member Shirley Estabrook (1968). </p><p>A 1967 memorandum from White to Baker lists the criteria for how Time Inc. would judge a possible newspaper acquisition. Criteria included editorial empathy so that the newspaper values were not resolutely different from Time Inc.'s; growth potential; existing market size; and favorable competitive situation.</p><p>One product of Fuerbringer's work in newspaper acqusitions was a proposal for Time-Life News, a wire service to sell news information to daily newspapers. Fuerbringer and Time-Life News Service Chief Murray Gart proposed it via memorandum in late 1968. Fuerbringer managed an additional project to explore this idea, and an experimental run occurred in June 1969 headed by Roy Rowan (borrowed from <title render="italic">Life</title>). Time-Life News ultimately did not happen.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>"Retire? Never." <title render="italic">FYI</title>, September 29, 1975.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_ref2"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Otto Fuerbringer's files on newspaper development contain research on newspaper companies throughout the United States either for acquisition purposes or informational purposes in order to create a Time Inc. daily newspaper. Research records include financials and other business reports, press releases, correspondence, clippings, and notes. Fuerbringer's files include originals and copies of documents from staff previously working on newspaper development.  </p><p>His files also includes records on the proposed Time-life News wire service and the acquisition of Lloyd Hollister Inc. and North Shore Publishing Company. The 1968 proposal to launch Time-Life News is in one of the general memoranda folders. </p><p>Fuerbringer's files include early research on <title render="italic">The Washington Star</title>. While his files indicate owner was not interested in selling in 1968, Time Inc. did acquire this newspaper later in 1978.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_7a8db9ef72cbd54aec61a2d06c26bc20"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series begins with general files alphabetically organized with general memoranda and correspondence in the front followed by national news companies, then newspapers and news companies by state. Files on the final project Time-Life News are at the end. The folders for <title render="italic">Newark News</title> were removed in 1975 though some materials were found loose and put back into place.</p><p>The arrangement is based on the original

She held positions on the business side of <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title> beginning in 1966 culimating in a position as the associate business manager from 1973 to 1977. From 1978 to 1980 she was the business manager of <title render="italic">Money</title>. She briefly held the position of Time-Life Films director of personnel and administration before being promoted to the Video Group director of finance and administration. At the end of 1985, she was named the corporate director of administration. In April 1987 she is listed as the director of administrative services for the Magazine Group which seems like the same role as before, but within the new Time Warner company structure. In August 1987, she is promoted to vice president of administrative services. The 1992 department heads list has her as the vice president of Magazine Administrative Services which sounds like it is still the same role within the Magazine Group of Time Warner. The Magazine Group later reverted to a subsidiary called Time Inc.</p><p>According to a job description in Di Sapio's bio file, the director of administration supported the chief administrative officer. The CAO oversaw ISG (which is not defined), human resources, international administration, and the corporate business office. Magazine Administrative Services in 1992 oversaw Security, Dining, Telecommunication, Travel Services, and Facilities Management. Announcements about Di Sapio's promotions never state that she was taking over duties from retiring vice president Charles Bear although their roles were similar in some ways.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_8344123da3be26764c34bbc0453b4fce"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Vice President of Administration Rosemarie Di Sapio files include her records as vice president and director of this office. Records include memoranda and documents from corporate offices regarding expenses and staff movement; files regarding the expenses related to meetings and conferences; and records regarding overhauls in staffing numbers at Time Inc. The personnel files kept by Di Sapio's office include performance reviews, termination agreements and payouts, and a small amount of court records. </p><p>Archives transfer forms for Di Sapio's files are in her bio file (MS 3009-RG 2). Her files were sent to the Time Inc. Archives between 1988 and 1991. It looks like a large amount of her files were either culled prior to acquisition by the New-York Historical Society or possibly dispersed into one of the assembled collections created by the Time Inc. Archives.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f2c9a4afa60f3c8998dc77a3e7f50452"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Organized into two series:<lb/>

Rukeyser to a one-year assignment as the director of international business development to explore international publishing opportunities. This newly created position initially reported to Executive Vice President of Magazines Kelso Sutton. In this role, Rukeyser set up a joint venture to publish a French-language version of <title render="italic">Fortune</title>. </p><p>Rukeyser joined Time Inc. in 1967 as an associate editor at <title render="italic">Fortune</title>. In 1972, he was appointed the founding managing editor of the new magazine <title render="italic">Money</title>. After overseeing Money for eight years, Rukeyser moved back to <title render="italic">Fortune</title> as its managing editor and remained there until his final post at Time Inc. as director of international business development. Rukeyser left Time Inc. in 1988.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>"Rukeyser Moves On." <title render="italic">FYI</title>, February 18, 1988.</p><p>Personnel and Organization: Department Head Lists. Time Inc.

His research includes the issue if articles from the original Time Inc. magazies could be directly translated or if additional editing and rewriting was required. Rukeyser explored partnerships with publishers outside of the United States such as Gruner + Jahr and Singapore Press Holdings Ltd Group. He also received a proposal from Sinolink Group for a Chinese edition of <title render="italic">Time</title> magazine. Rukeyser also researched other types of media markets including television and VCR use. Time Inc. contracted consultant Lee B. Hall for this project, and Rukeyser's files include extensive correspondence with opinions and research reports from Hall.</p><p>Rukeyser's role at the corporate management level overlapped in function with the Time Inc. International department although he was not part of this department. Further records on Time Inc.'s international publishing ventures are in Time Inc.
