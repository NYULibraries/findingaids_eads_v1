    <abstract id="aspace_cba7d10b69cfe1d27130f2ff47f350eb">The collection documents the programs and administration of the New York Foundling Hospital, 1869-2009, and the St. Agatha Home for Children, which operated separately from the Foundling beginning in 1884, before merging into the Foundling in 1977. The Foundling opened in 1869, under the auspices of the Sisters of Charity, as a Catholic haven for abandoned babies.  It was one of the principal institutions sending children to live with families in the country, in a program known today as the "orphan train."  That program ended in 1929.  Thereafter the Foundling expanded, diversified, and decentralized. Today the Foundling is an organization providing foster care, adoption, social work, and community-based preventive and health services to children and families in New York and Puerto Rico.

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>The collection was donated in 2009 by the New York Foundling Hospital.  Much of the material was collected and assembled by Sister Marilda Joseph at the Foundling, beginning in September 1997.  She sent questionnaires to, and requested materials from, administrators of Foundling programs, and kept these materials grouped by program.  Beginning in late 2006, Richard Reilly of the Ignation Volunteer Corps, in consultation with administrators at the Foundling, rearranged some of Sister Marilda's categories, added new ones, and incorporated other materials from the Sisters of Charity archives, materials from the Vincent Fontana Center, and materials from the basement of 590 Avenue of the Americas.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p><emph render="bold">The Early Years</emph></p><p>The Foundling Asylum of the Sisters of Charity in the City of New York opened at 17 East 12th Street on October 11, 1869, as a Catholic haven for abandoned babies.  Sister Mary Irene Fitzgibbon (Sister Irene), formerly Superior at St. Peter's on Barclay Street, founded the institution.  The nuns placed a cradle outside the building to receive infants, and almost immediately the shelter was filled to capacity.</p><p>Sister Irene quickly instituted a Boarding-Out Department through which off-site married wet nurses took in one or two babies, and were provided an allowance.  Alternatively, to encourage mothers to remain with their infants at the Foundling for at least three months, the sisters stopped leaving the crib outside the door, requiring the mother to ring the bell and deliver the child to the sister in attendance.  When a mother could be persuaded to stay, she could nurse another infant besides her own, and might ideally choose to keep her baby upon leaving the Foundling.</p><p>The building was too small for the hundreds of children the Foundling received.  The asylum moved to larger quarters at 3 Washington Square in 1870, and moved again in 1873.  The state granted the Foundling an entire block, 68th-69th Streets, Lexington-Third Avenues, which the Foundling developed into a grand Victorian institutional complex.  The main building at 175 East 68th Street was completed in 1873, followed by St. Ann's Maternity Hospital on the corner of 69th and Lexington in 1880, St. John's Children's Hospital on the corner of 69th and Third in 1881, St. Irene's residence (originally built as a quarantine for weaned babies returned from boarding with wet nurses) on the corner of 68th and Third in 1896, and the Hillyer Memorial Building, built ca. 1906-1907 on 68th and Lexington as a dormitory and kindergarten for young children.  </p><p><emph render="bold">The "Orphan Train"</emph></p><p>The issue of how to care for children past infancy was pressing.  In 1873 the Foundling began chartering trains (now known as "orphan trains") to carry children to Catholic families in Maryland, and later to other states in the West and South.  The Foundling's placing-out program was part of a larger movement, run by many organizations from the mid-nineteenth century through the 1920s.  During this period, tens of thousands of children without families willing or able to care for them were transported out of the city to country homes, contributing to the country's westward expansion.  Most children from New York City were sent either by the Children's Aid Society (beginning in 1853) or the Foundling (beginning 20 years later).  Families receiving children from the Foundling signed a document agreeing to raise the child Catholic, and giving the institution legal right to remove the "indentured" child should the placement prove unsatisfactory.  Before children went west, they lived and attended nursery school at the Foundling.  </p><p><emph render="bold">Evolution of the Foundling</emph></p><p>In 1891 the Foundling Asylum changed its name to the New York Foundling Hospital, and amended its mission to formally include not only abandoned children and foundlings but also destitute and dependent children.  Sister Irene died in 1896.  Sister Teresa Vincent McCrystal, who had been with Sister Irene since the inception, took over as Director.  She saw the institution through two crises.  </p><p>The first was an incident in Arizona in 1904, in which a mob of non-Catholic Anglo families forcibly removed children from Catholic Mexican families with whom they had been placed by the Foundling.  The Supreme Court of Arizona ruled against the Foundling, in New York Foundling Hospital v Gatti in 1905, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case.  </p><p>The other crisis was a sensationalized investigation of the city's private (particularly Catholic) child-caring institutions and of the State Board of Charities by John A. Kingsbury, New York City's Commissioner of Charities, in 1916.  Although the Foundling was not singled out for censure, the organization was required to submit to more city oversight and to change its foundational principle that a mother might surrender her child with no questions asked.  </p><p>After Sister Teresa Vincent's death in 1917, Sister Anna Michella Bowen, who had been in charge of the placing-out program, succeeded her.  In 1926, Sister Xavier Maria Hurley became director, and ended the placing-out program in the west and south.  She was followed by Sister Dominica Maria Rochford in 1931 who continued her predecessor's work of professionalizing the Foundling's social work programs.  </p><p>A 60 acre annex, St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea, donated by Charles Schwab of Bethlehem Steel, opened at Huguenot, Staten Island, in 1910 for overflow of mothers and babies.  In 1927 the Foundling charter was amended to advocate that families be kept together whenever possible, and that adopted and foster families reside in the New York area so that more intensive supervision could be maintained.  The policy of "indenture" was discontinued, and the maternity and pediatric hospitals became teaching hospitals.  A School for Baby Nurses began training students that year.  A Social Service Department for unwed mothers was initiated in 1930.  In the 1930's, the Foundling consisted of St. John's Children's Hospital, St. Ann's Maternity Hospital, the Boarding Department, the Adoption Department, St. Mary's Temporary Shelter for unmarried mothers, and the St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea annex.  </p><p>The two hospitals were closed in 1945 and 1946. After that, the Foundling focused less on medical services and emphasized foster and adoption services, nursery care for children and shelter for unwed mothers.  In 1958, they left their Victorian complex on 68th Street, and moved across the street to new modern headquarters at 1175 Third Avenue.</p><p><emph render="bold">From the 1960's to the Present</emph></p><p>In the 1960's and 1970's, the organization decentralized into local community based residences, day care centers, family service programs and preventive service facilities, and opened an office in Puerto Rico, while continuing to provide institutional care, boarding home care, and adoption for children, and services to unmarried mothers.  The Foundling merged with the St. Agatha Home for Children in 1977 and the latter became the St. Agatha Home of the New York Foundling Hospital.  St. Agatha, also run by the Sisters of Charity, was founded in 1884 as a home for orphan girls, but had diversified to run group homes for developmentally disabled children, children with emotional problems, refugee children, and others.  </p><p>A 1985 booklet by Sister Marian Healy described the NY Foundling Hospital as "a family-oriented agency administered under Catholic auspices and committed to the preservation of family life, especially those whose family life is disrupted through poverty, sickness, and neglect…All of the services of the Foundling, administered by the Sisters of Charity, are part of the ministry of the Catholic Church in the Archdiocese of New York.  It is our aim to foster the compassion of the Gospel by recognizing the absolute worth of every individual."</p><p>The Foundling moved into a smaller building at 595 Avenue of the Americas in 1988.  The Third Avenue building had been designed as an orphanage, but the new building was built with wide halls and large therapy rooms to reflect a new mission of helping handicapped and seriously ill children, as well as providing a maternity shelter for teens in their last trimester, a crisis nursery for abused or neglected children, and centers for emotionally disturbed pre-teens and teen girls.  The Vincent J. Fontana Center, a separate building dedicated to child abuse prevention and treatment, opened on Christopher Street in 1999.  </p><p>The St. Agatha property in Nanuet was sold in 2005.  That same year, the Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center became an independent entity in the 595 Avenue of the Americas building, separate from the Foundling.  The Foundling no longer managed a hospital, and dropped the word "hospital" from its name. These changes allowed the Foundling to expand its core services of foster care and adoption, and to develop new community-based programs.  In 2007 it embarked on a demonstration project to provide support and guidance to youth in the juvenile justice system and their families, to keep offenders in their homes and communities rather than detained in an institution.  In 2008, the Foundling partnered with the Mott Haven Academy to create the first charter school in the nation specifically designed to serve children in foster care and the child welfare system.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content</head>
<p>The collection documents the programs and administration of the New York Foundling Hospital, 1869-2009, and the St. Agatha Home for Children, which operated separately from the Foundling beginning in 1884, before merging into the Foundling in 1977. </p><p>The collection includes minutes and annual reports; correspondence and memos; bound registers and other administrative volumes; pamphlets, brochures and fliers; legal documents; reports; grant proposals; manuals; birth certificates; clippings and periodicals; published books; audiovisual materials including VHS tapes; and photographic prints.  There are a particularly large number of materials by and about Vincent Fontana, Medical Director of the Foundling (1962-2005) in Series IV.6. Unusual items in the collection include circa 1000 notes by mothers and other guardians leaving babies at the Foundling 1869-1884 (Series XIII). There are also yearbooks from the Foundling's nursing school 1948-1970 (Series IV.29), and two nurse's capes (Series XVI).</p><p>The collection is notable for its large number of photographic prints. The majority of prints are 8x10s created by professional photographers for public relations purposes.  There are also many non-professional snapshots documenting activities for internal purposes, from recent years.  Most photographs date from 1950-2000, but there are some prints from earlier decades of the Foundling.  Many photographs are interspersed throughout the collection, arranged according to the department or program they document.  Others are collected in a separate chronological series of visual materials (Series XI).  This arrangement reflects the original order of the materials as they were kept at the Foundling.  Claire Yaffa, James Heffernan and David M. Grossman are the professional photographers most represented in the collection.</p><p>The Foundling is well known for its participation in the "Orphan Train;" however, genealogical researchers should be aware that this collection contains no case files from the placing-out and boarding-out program.  Those records remain at the New York Foundling Hospital.  The collection at the New-York Historical Society includes documents of the 1904 "Arizona Incident" and materials from reunions of Orphan Train riders from the 1960s to the present.  The collection also includes restricted volumes 1869-1958 which contain information on Orphan Train children, among other children and parents.  <emph render="bold">Special permission is needed from the New York Foundling Hospital to view records that include personal information on children, labeled as Restricted in this finding aid.</emph>  Restricted records include books of baptisms and confirmations, registers of mothers, foster home records, etc.</p><p>This finding aid provides links to digital images of selected items from the collection, including photographic prints, pamphlets, and notes left with children.

This subseries concludes with one folder containing miscellaneous departmental annual reports 1977 and 1981.  The miscellaneous reports were prepared by departments not represented elsewhere in the collection.  </p><p>For separate reports by other departments, see Series IV.</p></scopecontent><c

These are followed by annual reports to other organizations.</p><p>The State Board of Charities performed annual or biannual inspections of the Foundling beginning in 1900.  This New York State government department changed its name to the State Department of Social Welfare in 1930.  The subseries contains inspections by the state agencies of the Foundling's Infant Asylum 1900-1928, the Foundling's hospitals 1900-1910 and 1930-1944, the Foundling's Placing-Out and Boarding-Out Departments 1901-1935, the Foundling as a whole in 1944 and 1951, as well as annual reports by the Foundling to the State Department of Social Welfare 1937-1951. </p><p>The subseries concludes with three other annual reports: an annual report of the Section on Care of Dependent Children to the Welfare Council of New York City (an association of social service agencies including the Foundling), 1936; and 2 annual reports of the Foundling to the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum (1952 and 1953).  Note that Series IV.5 - Boarding Department - also includes annual reports of that department prepared for the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum. </p><p>For State Department of Social Welfare/Board of Charities inspections of the St. Joseph's-by-The-Sea facility, see Series IV.38 -

Many subseries contain only a few folders, or sometimes a single folder, of material.  Materials include correspondence, proposals, reports, pamphlets or brochures, and clippings.  Many subseries contain photographic prints, arranged at the end of the subseries.</p><p>The bulk of the individual programs collected in this series were initiated in the 1970's-1990's.  There are, however, significant exceptions, including the Boarding Department and the Ladies Auxiliary which both began in 1869, St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea which began in 1910, and Nurse Training which began in 1927.</p><p>The records of the St. Agatha Home for Children are not collected in this series.  They are arranged separately as Series V, because the program operated independently from the Foundling from 1884 to 1977.  Thereafter, it became a program of the Foundling.  </p><p>The scope and content notes for some subseries refer the researcher to other subseries which may also have pertinent information. </p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref361_3ly" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IV.1.

It began in September 1972, operated in tandem with the Temporary Shelter, and was phased out in 1987.  </p><p>For other materials related to child abuse, see Child Abuse Prevention Services, Crisis Nursery, and Fontana Center subseries.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref388_j17" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abusing Mother-Child Program - Proposal, Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate>1971 April 12 - 1975 January 20 and undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_b134573c2636a67a61c5b293855008b3" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022078]" type="Offsite-Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_b134573c2636a67a61c5b293855008b3" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref389_lbi" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abusing Mother-Child Program/Child Abuse Rehabilitation Program - Reports, Memos, Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate>circa 1972 - 1987 March 13</unitdate><container id="aspace_2617139546b7e11c0ae88391e54fd8a6" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022078]" type="Offsite-Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_2617139546b7e11c0ae88391e54fd8a6" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref789_4am" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abusing Parent and Child Unit - Pamphlet</unittitle><unitdate normal="1977/1977" type="inclusive">1977</unitdate><container id="aspace_10d12e269beb90080d32a5af7f6ae337" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022078]" type="Offsite-Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_10d12e269beb90080d32a5af7f6ae337" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref457_z4t" level="file"><did><unittitle>Child Abuse Rehabailitation Program - Special Services for Children document re: budget, organization</unittitle><unitdate>1986 April 22</unitdate><container id="aspace_8deb80dacfdb3a727b3aae8618afc87e" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022078]" type="Offsite-Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_8deb80dacfdb3a727b3aae8618afc87e" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref409_987" level="file"><did><unittitle>Abusing Mother-Child Program Temporary Shelter Therapeutic Nursery - Photographic Prints</unittitle><unitdate>1978 and undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_4dbd55805e667c628641b4ebf01540b4" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022078]" type="Offsite-Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_4dbd55805e667c628641b4ebf01540b4" type="Folder">5</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref362_cmu" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IV.2.

Beginning in 2001 it operated under the umbrella of the Fontana Center of the Foundling.  Children up to age 7 (and some older siblings) could stay in the nursery up to twenty-one days (with some exceptions), and were provided lodging, medical care, clothing, meals, behavioral assessments, and supervised play sessions.  Parents received counseling, crisis intervention, emergency funds, and referrals for additional services.  The Crisis Nursery operated a 24-hour Parent Helpline for parents in crisis.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref470_b4e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Crisis Nursery - Proposals and Evaluations</unittitle><unitdate normal="1972/1989" type="inclusive">1972-1989</unitdate><container id="aspace_4a89a5847d6289f7a354854003b4b15f" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022262]" type="Offsite-Box">25</container><container parent="aspace_4a89a5847d6289f7a354854003b4b15f" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref471_m9b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Crisis Nursery - Operations - Memos, reports, minutes, policies</unittitle><unitdate>circa 1983-2004</unitdate><container id="aspace_225cb6a412d9ba393465d5c0fc6f9b7f" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022262]" type="Offsite-Box">25</container><container parent="aspace_225cb6a412d9ba393465d5c0fc6f9b7f" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref472_wik" level="file"><did><unittitle>Crisis Nursery - Pamphlets, Helpline flier, brochures, other publications</unittitle><unitdate>circa 1984-2001 and undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_0037d648f471a318e4ca1e2811ae6859" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022262]" type="Offsite-Box">25</container><container parent="aspace_0037d648f471a318e4ca1e2811ae6859" type="Folder">3</container></did><dao ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n-yhs/sets/72157625003624722/" ns2:role="Image-Service" ns2:show="embed" ns2:title="Click to view selected images" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Click to view selected images</p></daodesc></dao></c><c id="aspace_ref473_o8s" level="file"><did><unittitle>Crisis Nursery - Research</unittitle><unitdate>circa 1993-2003 and undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_f3273e4bd4bb507f85104a08cd2d6230" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022262]" type="Offsite-Box">25</container><container parent="aspace_f3273e4bd4bb507f85104a08cd2d6230" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref474_4v9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Crisis Nursery - Photographic Prints</unittitle><unitdate>circa 1965-1999</unitdate><container id="aspace_06970ade97bdef07392e7d102f05f2a5" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022262]" type="Offsite-Box">25</container><container parent="aspace_06970ade97bdef07392e7d102f05f2a5" type="Folder">5</container></did><dao ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n-yhs/sets/72157625067409486/" ns2:role="Image-Service" ns2:show="embed" ns2:title="Click to view selected images" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Click to view selected images</p></daodesc></dao></c><c id="aspace_ref475_0f3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Crisis Nursery - Clippings</unittitle><unitdate>circa 1969-2004</unitdate><container id="aspace_3de6acbf1bbfae2c9982b7c91f7fb26e" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022262]" type="Offsite-Box">25</container><container parent="aspace_3de6acbf1bbfae2c9982b7c91f7fb26e" type="Folder">6</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref373_b4r" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IV.13.

Two folders of materials including photographic prints, circa 1948-1982.</p><p>The Ladies Auxiliary was founded in 1869 simultaneously with the Foundling itself.  The iconic cradle wherein mothers deposited babies was donated by the first president of the Ladies Auxiliary, Mrs. Caroline Gilbert Thebaud, who served as president until 1902.  The Ladies Auxiliary's purpose over the years included, but was not limited to, sewing and knitting clothing for children at the Foundling, hosting benefits, and soliciting donations.  Materials include by-laws, constitution and charter, a volume of minutes, correspondence, donation booklets, programs, reports, invitations, clippings, and photographic prints, 1869-1986.</p><p>Lots for Little, Inc. was a thrift shop created for the benefit of eight Catholic organizations, including the Foundling.  Members of the Foundling's Ladies Auxiliary volunteered at Lots for Little, and served as intermediaries between the Foundling and Lots for Little.  One folder of materials 1960-1987.</p><p>Other records of Foundling fundraising, excluding these four associations, may be found throughout the rest of the collection.

Three yearbooks from 1948 also contain photographic prints, attached with photocorners.</p><p>The correspondence in the series appears to have been grouped to reflect the program at three milestone points -- its inception, its shift to becoming a child care training program, and its closing.  There is no correspondence from intervening years.</p><p>For related material, please see Series XVI - Nurse's Capes, as well Series IV.29, Nursery School.  Foundling nurses and nurses-in-training worked with the children of the nursery school, and the programs shared a director and staff.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_a0b21d4b9f9aae87926f32e2165510fe"><head>Historical Note</head><p>The Foundling operated a school for baby nurses beginning in 1927.  Between 1941 and 1950 the program went through a state of flux, as St. John's Children's Hospital at the Foundling closed and the mission of the nursing school changed to reflect the mission of the Foundling -- to care for dependent or neglected children, rather than sick children.  State certifying agencies also expressed concern that Foundling students trained in the care of well babies and children should not be confused with practical or registered nurses trained and licensed to work with sick babies and children.  Beginning around 1950, students graduating from the Foundling's year-long residential program were formally known as Infant and Child Care Technicians; informally they were still often called baby nurses. They received a Foundling diploma and pin, recited the Baby Nurse Pledge and wore a nurse's uniform and cap, but were not licensed nurses.  In the late 1960's the program was renamed the School of Child Care Workers, and then the School for Infant and Child Care, with graduates continuing to wear the uniform, cap and pin. The program was phased out in 1973.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref600_a5y" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nurse Training School - Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate>1924 October 22 - 1927 January 24</unitdate><container id="aspace_c4d8707fce52ef98744ae4e1a7cceed8" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022270]" type="Offsite-Box">33</container><container parent="aspace_c4d8707fce52ef98744ae4e1a7cceed8" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref601_vaz" level="file"><did><unittitle>Nurse Training School -

In between, there is one vintage photographic print of a group of orphan train riders, and one folder of blank forms.  There is no 19th century material.  Case files from the "orphan train" are in the possession of the N.Y. Foundling Hospital and are not part of this collection. </p><p>Volumes from the boarding department are in Series XIV and are restricted.  For unrestricted materials, see also subseries IV. 3 - Adoption, and IV.6 - Boarding Department. There are several published volumes about the orphan train and the "Arizona Incident" in Series XVII.    </p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_242294f5426857800e0543e2b8e76173"><head>Historical Note</head><p>In 1873 the Foundling began chartering trains (now known as "orphan trains") to carry children to Catholic families in Maryland, and later to other states in the West and South.  The Foundling's placing-out program was part of a larger movement, run by many organizations from the mid-nineteenth century through the 1920s.  During this period, tens of thousands of children without families willing or able to care for them were transported out of the city to country homes, contributing to the country's westward expansion.  Most children from New York City were sent either by the Children's Aid Society (beginning in 1853) or the Foundling (beginning 20 years later).  Families receiving children from the Foundling signed a document agreeing to raise the child Catholic, and giving the institution legal right to remove the "indentured" child should the placement prove unsatisfactory.  Before children went west, they lived and attended nursery school at the Foundling.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref647_dwr" level="file"><did><unittitle>Orphan Train, Arizona Incident - correspondence photocopies</unittitle><unitdate>1904 June 18 -

In 1976 this unit became the Health Related Facility, providing medical care and a range of therapies and social services.  The program continued to evolve, and in 1987 the Sisters of Charity restructured and renamed it the Pediatric Center (aka the Medical Center for Pediatrics and Rehabilitation, or the New York Foundling Hospital Center for Pediatric, Medical, and Rehabilitative Care), an affiliate of the Foundling, located in the Foundling's building.  </p><p>In 2005, now fully independent from the Foundling, the Pediatric Center was renamed the Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center.  It has continued to expand and to decentralize, while temporarily leasing space in the Foundling's building.  As it is not administered by the Foundling, the records of the Elizabeth Seton Pediatric Center are not part of this collection.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref679_5xx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Health-Related Facility - Correspondence, Memos, Reports</unittitle><unitdate>1972 June 20 - circa 1982 January </unitdate><container id="aspace_53907528378c5b44baaf458b1c6388c8" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022274]" type="Offsite-Box">37</container><container parent="aspace_53907528378c5b44baaf458b1c6388c8" type="Folder">9</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref680_2k4" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pediatric Center/Health-Related Facility - pamphlets, fliers, brochures, invitation, clippings</unittitle><unitdate>circa 1978-2005</unitdate><container id="aspace_5b4c4777308bc724df5b9251c79b9151" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022274]" type="Offsite-Box">37</container><container parent="aspace_5b4c4777308bc724df5b9251c79b9151" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref681_1g3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pediatric Center/Health-Related Facility - Photographic prints (8x10)</unittitle><unitdate>circa 1972-2005</unitdate><container id="aspace_fee3cf48983ffb5874988a14e2a1054b" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022274]" type="Offsite-Box">37</container><container parent="aspace_fee3cf48983ffb5874988a14e2a1054b" type="Folder">11</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref682_oao" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pediatric Center/Health-Related Facility - Photographic prints (3x5-5x7), contact sheets, and negatives</unittitle><unitdate>circa 1972-2005</unitdate><container id="aspace_7ca1a19720658a42dd974272da532e19" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022274]" type="Offsite-Box">37</container><container parent="aspace_7ca1a19720658a42dd974272da532e19" type="Folder">12</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_ref541_xhr" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IV.35.

The property was a gift to the Sisters of Charity from Charles and Eugenia Schwab, and the center was at first known as "the Eugenia Schwab."  The Sisters of Charity repurposed the location as a high school in 1963. The last Foundling children left the property around 1965. </p><p>The subseries includes, but is not limited to, administrative correspondence, inspection reports and legal documents, and photographic prints and other visual materials.  The records document the center from prior to its donation until after it closed as a Foundling facility, but there are no records from its current incarnation as a high school.  Folders are arranged chronologically, with miscellaneous and photographic materials at the end.  Photographic prints are also affixed to a 1935 document.</p><p>Volumes created at the center, including baptism and intake books, are arranged in the St. Joseph's-by-the-Sea subseries of Series XIV - Records of Children and Mothers.  Volumes in that series are restricted.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref724_8ib" level="file"><did><unittitle>St. Josephs-by-the-Sea - Legal documents (mortgage, permits, certificate of occupancy, etc.)</unittitle><unitdate>1900 August 1 - 1974 January 29</unitdate><container id="aspace_66e5d04a3d2245cd7f805fe0ae838014" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022277]" type="Offsite-Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_66e5d04a3d2245cd7f805fe0ae838014" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref725_kpy" level="file"><did><unittitle>St. Josephs-by-the-Sea - Correspondence - Charles and Eugenia Schwab</unittitle><unitdate>1907 October 16 - 1915 November 4</unitdate><container id="aspace_771b99cc7ea07cdb60e3487ab06d3e15" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022277]" type="Offsite-Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_771b99cc7ea07cdb60e3487ab06d3e15" type="Folder">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref726_qej" level="file"><did><unittitle>St. Josephs-by-the-Sea - Correspondence - Administrative/Legal</unittitle><unitdate>1909 December 7 - 1921 November 23</unitdate><container id="aspace_1da2d2873bcae3079659650feb3be8b0" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022277]" type="Offsite-Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_1da2d2873bcae3079659650feb3be8b0" type="Folder">5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref727_54q" level="file"><did><unittitle>St. Josephs-by-the-Sea - State Department of Social Welfare/State Board of Charities inspection reports</unittitle><unitdate normal="1910/1929" type="inclusive">1910-1929</unitdate><container id="aspace_6441380002b23d7392684e308ec8b3c8" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022277]" type="Offsite-Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_6441380002b23d7392684e308ec8b3c8" type="Folder">6</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref728_0tw" level="file"><did><unittitle>St. Josephs-by-the-Sea - Correspondence - Administrative/Legal</unittitle><unitdate>1924 February 16 - 1936 February 4</unitdate><container id="aspace_40f57b50fd9017545f0d7fab1e0391ea" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022277]" type="Offsite-Box">40</container><container parent="aspace_40f57b50fd9017545f0d7fab1e0391ea" type="Folder">7</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref729_d89" level="file"><did><unittitle>St. Josephs-by-the-Sea - Insurance Survey with attached photographic prints</unittitle><unitdate>1935 May 27</unitdate><container id="aspace_a692f11f62553c0e335802544fef3446" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022278]" type="Offsite-Box">41</container><container parent="aspace_a692f11f62553c0e335802544fef3446" type="Folder">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref730_0qc" level="file"><did><unittitle>St. Josephs-by-the-Sea - Correspondence - Administrative/Legal</unittitle><unitdate>1940 March 2 - 1972 November 17</unitdate><container id="aspace_be5adfa948b6fc6eb1f7369f222ad7cc" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022278]" type="Offsite-Box">41</container><container parent="aspace_be5adfa948b6fc6eb1f7369f222ad7cc" type="Folder">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref731_hnw" level="file"><did><unittitle>St. Josephs-by-the-Sea - Miscellaneous narratives, reports, correspondence, brochure, clippings</unittitle><unitdate>circa 1909-2000</unitdate><container id="aspace_196f1373fca8224b8d9fc57a6434c8ac" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022278]" type="Offsite-Box">41</container><container parent="aspace_196f1373fca8224b8d9fc57a6434c8ac" type="Folder">3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref732_p87" level="file"><did><unittitle>St. Josephs-by-the-Sea - Photographic prints, postcards</unittitle><unitdate>1937-1961 and undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_3fc6a72aee0c0e02cc1f10fb7fe9ae9d" label="Mixed Materials [10170000022278]" type="Offsite-Box">41</container><container parent="aspace_3fc6a72aee0c0e02cc1f10fb7fe9ae9d" type="Folder">4</container></did><dao ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/n-yhs/sets/72157624880054613/" ns2:role="Image-Service" ns2:show="embed" ns2:title="Click to view selected images" ns2:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Click to view selected images</p></daodesc></dao></c></c><c id="aspace_ref703_73d" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries IV.39.

Its mission was to be a home and trade school for orphans and neglected children.  Most children were referred by the New York City courts.  Over the years, land adjacent to the original property was purchased, and various buildings and wings were erected, including a building which functioned first as a "Preventorium" for sick children from 1913-1945, and later as a school.  In the 1950's and 1960's, the St. Agatha Home consisted of about two dozen buildings on about 172 acres of land.  In 1950, approximately 600 children lived there, and 358 in 1967.  </p><p>Beginning in 1969, St. Agatha decentralized, operating small group homes in Rockland County, the Bronx and Staten Island, providing community-based care for youth awaiting possible foster placement.  In addition, it ran prevention programs, and opened two non-secure-detention shelters for juveniles in the criminal justice system.  In the 1970's St. Agatha's struggled financially, relying on city funds during the years of the city's fiscal crisis, while the percentage of teenagers and children with severe problems and special needs increased.  The St. Agatha Home merged into the NY Foundling Hospital in 1977.  Consolidation of two Sisters of Charity institutions providing related services would enable more effective coordinated care.</p><p>After the merger, the St. Agatha Home of the New York Foundling established several new critical care programs for developmentally disabled children and adults, programs for Vietnamese boat children, and shelters for homeless youth, among other services.</p><p>The latest material in this series dates from 2001.  In 2005, the St. Agatha Home closed and the property in Nanuet was sold.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref783_83r" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries V.1.

Images include building exteriors, events and people.  Most photographs were created for publicity purposes. 
The fourth box consists of negatives and positive transparencies depicting a Foundling exhibition, mounted circa 1969-1994, tracing the organization's history in photographs and other visual materials.  Most of the images in these transparencies and negatives exist in other formats (photographic prints etc.) in the first three boxes of this series, or in other series in the collection.</p><p>Photographic prints are arranged roughly chronologically.  At each new main location of the Foundling, exteriors are arranged first, followed by interiors grouped in folders by subject.  The series concludes with 7 folders of material by the photographer Claire Yaffa, including photographic prints, printed photo essays, and related material such as consent forms.</p><p>Hundreds of additional photographic prints can be found in other series in the collection, especially Series IV, V, and VI.  This distribution throughout the collection reflects the original order in which the materials were arranged at the Foundling.  A book about the Foundling including photographs by Claire Yaffa is part of Series XVII, Published Books.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1028_8yh" level="file"><did><unittitle>17 East 12th St. (location of Foundling, 1869) exterior -
