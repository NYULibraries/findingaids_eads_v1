            <p>The collection contains various notebooks, journals, and diaries kept by both students and professors at New York University. The student notebooks provide a useful insight into the lectures and classroom materials presented in the late nineteenth century. John Torrey’s diary sheds light on the development of his innovative classification system and would be of interest to scholars studying botanical history. Also included in the collection is a compilation of sermons given by pastor and NYU Professor Howard Crosby.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series I (1860-1863) (MC 31) Charles Ludlum</emph>—This series consists of seven notebooks. Most of the notebooks appear to contain verbatim portions of professorial lectures, although some, such as Loomis’ Algebra, were copied directly from the course textbook. The notebooks are representative of classes in: Greek Language and Literature taught by Professor Henry M. Baird; English Literature, Rhetoric, and Natural Religion taught by Professor Benjamin N. Martin; Evidences of Revelation taught by Chancellor Isaac Ferris; and Comparative Physiology taught by Professor Henry Draper.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series II (1878-1880) (MC 32) Ezekiel Deyo Van Dyck</emph>—This series contains five notebooks. The student notebooks are representative of classes taught by professors Henry M. Baird and John J. Stevenson spanning 1878-1880.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series III (1880-1883) (MC 33) James Morton Paton</emph>—This series consists of seven notebooks. The notebooks are representative of classes taught by Professors John C. Draper, George W. Coakley, John J. Stevenson, Henry M. Baird, and Albert H. Gallatin.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series IV (MC 34) (1839-1850) George Hendric Houghton</emph>—The journal entitled "Nugae" is a collection of orations and poetry written by Houghton and later presented to G.H. Houghton Butler from an enigmatic "S.H.B." Although several pages have been cut out from the journal, it still contains revealing thoughts and emotions of a young man aged 19 to 30 in early 19th century New York.</p>
            <p>Of special interest is "The Growth of Freedom", (pp. 1-17) an oration delivered at the University of the City of New York’s July 20, 1842 commencement, and the Valedictory Oration (pp. 19-29) delivered the same day. "National Retribution" (pp. 91-101) is the title of an oration delivered in the University Chapel on January 29, 1842. "On Leaving the South-West Turret of the University," (p. 77) written in December 1841, and "On Leaving the University," written in May 1843, expresses in poetical form Houghton’s mixed emotions upon graduating.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series V (MC 35) (1858) William Frank Burroughs</emph>- This series contains one student notebook covering the Lectures on Natural Philosophy delivered by Professor Elias A. Loomis in 1858. Included in the notes are sections on pneumatics, acoustics, heat, magnetism, and optics.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VI (MC 36) (1892-1893) John Henry MacCracken</emph>—The student notebook of John Henry MacCracken reflects the 1895 lecture of Professor John J. Stevenson on Physiology and the 1893 lecture of Professor Henry Mitchell MacCracken on Church History.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VII (MC 37) (1897) Elbert William Brown</emph>—This series consists of a single notebook. The cover of the notebook had a date of November 1897 and is apparently the notes of the lectures delivered by instructor John Henry MacCracken on Philosophy.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Series VIII (MC 39) (1833, 1938) John Torrey</emph>—This series contains a diary of John Torrey while he was traveling abroad in Europe. Included in this diary are references to his "natural system" of botanical classification.</p>
