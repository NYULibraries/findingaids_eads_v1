<p>The Kathy Martino Papers consist of one box of flyers, bulletins, and union newsletters related to Martino's work in organizing various industries in the 1970s. These materials relate to Martino's involvement with various unions, including hospital, electrical, steel, garment, food service, bakery, and auto workers, as well as veterans and the Unemployed Workers’ Organizing Committee. The collection largely consists of printed materials collected by Martino, some of which include Martino’s notes and doodles. These materials largely date from 1974 to 1976, but many of the flyers and bulletins are undated and some materials are dated as late as 1980. </p><p>The collection also contains several folders of Revolutionary Union (RU) May Day flyers 1974-1975, flyers and schedules from a 1976 Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) conference in Philadelphia, and an assortment of RU and RCP pamphlets and bulletins. Among the pamphlets are 2 original satirical drawings of labor bureaucrats and social-fascism.  The author of the drawings is not identified, but they were most likely created by Martino.</p>  </scopecontent>
