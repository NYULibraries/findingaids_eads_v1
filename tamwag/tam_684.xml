    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Edith Segal (1906-1997) was an American dancer, teacher, songwriter, and poet. She was born in New York's Lower East Side in 1906 to working-class Jewish immigrants. Throughout her life Segal was a committed leftist and civil rights advocate, and her work was closely tied to her political and civil activism. A supporter of the Soviet Union, Segal formed the dance company the Red Dancers in 1929 and choreographed performances in honor of V.I. Lenin. Her other works focused on topics related to civil and workers' rights as well as Jewish cultural themes. She created her most famous work <emph render="italic">Black and White</emph> in 1930, which was the first interracial dance performance in the United States. </p><p>In addition to dancing with her company, Segal taught at several leftist camps and recreational resorts in New York and New England, including Camp Kinderland, the Unity House, Cedar Isle Camp, Camp Nitgedaiget, and Camp Wocolona. In the mid to late 1930s, she was also involved with the Works Progress Administration's (WPA) Federal Theatre Project in New York and Detroit. Segal wrote several books of poetry, including three for children, from the 1950s to the 1980s, some of which were illustrated by her husband, Samuel Kamen. Throughout her career, she also wrote and lectured on dance.</p><p>Segal remained active in the arts and political communities up until her death in 1997 in New York City.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Edith Segal Papers (1918-1999) chronicle Segal's life as a teacher, dancer, poet, and political activist. Materials from the original donation in 2016 relate generally to labor activism and life in early-20th century America. They include materials collected by Segal, including a scrapbook from World War I; printed matter on topics including New York labor laws and May Day; and photographs of Labor Day rallies. Additionally, there are items created by Segal, including drafts of skits, one of which is about a workers' strike. The 2023 accretion consists of materials on Segal herself, and her participation in the civil rights and leftist movements. Her commitment to these causes can be viewed in her correspondence with prominent civil rights activists and the subjects of her many poems and New Year's cards, which include Ethel and Julius Rosenberg and Angela Davis. Her passion for performing and teaching dance is reflected in performance programs, flyers, sound recordings (audiocassette and audio reels) and photographs. There is a small amount of personal material, including a family tree, awards, honors, and tributes. Segal was beloved for her teaching and activism, which can be gleaned from the fan mail that she collected over the years.</p>  </scopecontent>

Additionally, there are a number of letters to and from the Soviet Union. Most of these letters refer to Segal's poetry and its message of peace. Segal's career as a poet can be gleaned from the vast amount of drafts, New Year's cards (with illustrations by her husband, Samuel Kamen), and published poems and songs in the collection. Performance programs and flyers showcase Segal's career as a dancer, and photographs, slides, and audio reels of performances at Camp Kinderland reflect Segal's career as a dance teacher.
