    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Founded by Scott Barry, the DUMBA Collective (1998-2006) was a non-profit arts collective in the DUMBO neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. It was devoted to the contemporary art practices of the queer community. They offered space to local and international artists, primarily queer, and gave the majority of the profit back to the artist.  The Collective was both a living space and an anarchist community center. It is most known for their Lusty Loft Parties and a filming location for John Cameron Mitchell's <emph render="italic">Shortbus</emph>. DUMBA lost its lease in 2006.</p>  </bioghist>
