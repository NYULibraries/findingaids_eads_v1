    <head>Provenance</head>
<p>The papers of Geoffrey T. Hellman were donated by Hellman to the Fales Library of New York University on June 15, 1969. A second donation of material was made by his daughter, Katharine, in November of 1985. Other collections of his papers are located in the New York Public Library and in the New York Historical Society. Geoffrey Hellman, a staff writer for The New Yorker, felt that the papers that had not yet been donated should stay in New York rather than go to his alma mater, Yale University, because the materials deal mostly with the city; hence, the donation to New York University.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Geoffrey T. Hellman was born in New York City in 1907, and was the son of writer, George Hellman. He attended Yale and contributed to the <title type="simple" render="italic">Yale News</title>, <title type="simple" render="italic">Yale Record</title> and the <title type="simple" render="italic">Yale Literary Magazine</title>. Upon graduating in 1928, he wrote for the <title type="simple" render="italic">New York Herald Tribune's</title> Sunday book supplement thanks to a recommendation by Thorton Wilder. By 1929, he secured a position at <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title> magazine as a reporter for the "Talk of the Town" section. Though he contributed to numerous publications in his career, he would be affiliated and most firmly identified with <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title>. </p><p>While with <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title>, Hellman wrote extensively about New York institutions such as the New York Zoological Society and the Bronx Zoo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera House, the Museum of Modern Art, the New York Public Library, the Pierpont Morgan Library, the United Nations, and the New York Stock Exchange, to promote public awareness of these institutions and of interesting events they sponsored. He also wrote about prominent people such as author Louis Auchincloss; New York Parks Commissioner Robert Moses, who sent him story ideas; and architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Because of his background and family connections, he was also <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker's</title> link to New York society and he reported on parties, local clubs and societies such as the Grolier Club, the Explorer's Club, the National Audubon Society, and the American Geographical Society, and exclusive restaurants, from which he collected an impressive number of menus.</p><p>His books include compilations of his pieces that appeared in <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title> ('How to Disappear for an Hour' and 'Mrs. De Peyster's Parties') and a book about the Smithsonian Institution ('Octopus on the Mall') and a history of the American Museum of Natural History ('Bankers, Bones and Beetles').</p><p>From 1936-1938, he was also the associate editor of <title type="simple" render="italic">Life </title>Magazine. During World War II, Hellman was in Washington D.C. where he wrote for the Office of Inter-American affairs, the War Department and helped to write a top-secret history of the OSS. </p><p>In addition to his pursuits as a writer, Hellman was also an enthusiastic butterfly collector. Hellman died in 1977.</p><p> Sources: </p><p><list><item> Hellman, Geoffrey T. "All about Geoffrey Hellman." <title type="simple" render="italic">Saturday Review of Literature</title>, v.

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Hellman Papers measured approximately 28 linear feet prior to processing. The collection was reduced to 26 linear feet after the removal of duplicate material. The Hellman Papers contain correspondence, research materials, drafts, proofs, manuscripts, and final publication material from his very prolific, nearly fifty year writing career. </p><p>Because Hellman intended this collection to be a record of his career and of the history of <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title>, he included in the donation notes intended for whoever would be using the collection with his insights about writing for <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title>. These notes are referred to in the finding aid as "notes to the user".</p><p>The collection has been divided into 16 series. The collection is organized primarily by type of article, which is determined by the magazine's own classification. The order of the series was determined by the number of articles Hellman wrote in a specific category. Series one consists of "Talk of the Town" articles, which comprised the bulk of Hellman's published work for <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title>. Series two consists of "Profiles." Series three is entitled "Subject Category" and it consists of articles organized by subject rather than type of article. Series four consists of "Casuals." Series five consists of "Onward and Upward" pieces. Series six consists of "Reporter At Large" pieces. Series seven contains information about Hellman's activities during World War II. Series eight consists of all the other kinds of articles Hellman wrote for <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title>. Series nine consists of information about <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title> style. Series 10 consists of articles Hellman wrote for publications other than <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title>. Series 11 consists of information about Hellman's published books. Series 12 consists of articles that cannot be identified by article type or publication that appear not to have been published. Series 13 consists of correspondence. Series 14 consists of Hellman's speeches. Series 15 consists of personal material unrelated to his career. Series 16 consists of financial information.</p><p>Oversized material that did not fit in the oversized boxes is housed in the map case under the collection name. Galleys are filed in a drawer set in the workroom.</p><p><title type="simple" render="bold">Series Description</title> </p><p><title type="simple" render="bold">Series 1. Talk of the Town</title> </p><p>Series 1 consists of short pieces entitled "Talk of the Town" and even shorter pieces within the "Talk of the Town" department entitled "Notes and Comments" and "Anecdotes." The subjects for "Talk of the Town" and "Notes and Comments" pieces were New York City events, places, and personalities. The "Anecdotes" were brief accounts written from anecdotes sent in by <title type="simple" render="italic">The New Yorker</title> readers or amusing newspaper or magazine errors. The "Talk of the Town" articles are arranged alphabetically by subject and chronologically within each subject. The "Notes and Comments" articles are arranged chronologically.</p><p>Included in this series are photocopies of the published articles, newspaper clippings, tearsheets, photographs, drafts, telegrams, postcards, leaflets, pamphlets, booklets, notes from Hellman to the user, drafts, edited drafts, financial records, galleys, edited galleys, revised galleys, and editorial proofs. </p><p><title type="simple" render="bold">Series 2. Profiles</title> </p><p>Series 2 consists of articles entitled "Profiles," published between 1931 and 1968, in which Hellman wrote biographical sketches of prominent and interesting individuals. Unlike "A Reporter At Large" articles in which Hellman reported on an interview with a subject without critically evaluating what was said, the "Profiles" were intended to be an objective portrayal of the subject, arrived at through interviews with the subject, his associates, and anyone familiar with him. The articles are arranged alphabetically by the last name of the subject with research material and correspondence arranged chronologically within each folder. </p><p>In folder 6, are three pen and ink drawings of artist George Biddle, two by himself and a third by his wife, artist Helene Sardeau. Folder 30 contains an addendum to the collection by the Fales Special Collections staff consisting of an invitation to an exhibition on Albert Gallatin. In folder 45, is a sketch by architect Le Corbusier of his design for the U.N. building.</p><p><title type="simple" render="bold">Series 3. Subject Category</title> </p><p>Series 3 consists of broad subjects, such as influential people and institutions, about which Hellman wrote several different kinds of articles between 1938 and 1968.

In the material on Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair magazine, are two letters from author William Dean Howells, dated August 4, 1889 and February 28, 1896 (folder 54) and a copy of the play, "Vanity Fair", Hellman wrote about Crowninshield that was never produced (folder 55).

The galleys and editorial proofs, because of their size, have been stored in a box for oversized material and are shelved separately.
