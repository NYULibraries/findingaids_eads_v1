    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>ACT-UAW Local 7902 (Adjuncts Come Together, in some early contracts they also have gone by Academics Coming Together) represents over 4,000 part-time and adjunct teachers at the New School and New York University. The union was formed in 2002 by adjuncts at NYU, which first ratified their first contract in 2004 and elected their first executive officers in 2005. In 2004, adjuncts at the New School began to negotiate, and reached an agreement with the New School in 2005. The union has successfully negotiated better pay, job security, partially subsidized health care, pension benefits, and promoted transparency within the universities' budgetary systems. In 2015, Tandon adjuncts voted yes for union representation.</p><p>In 2015, academic student workers at the New School began organizing under Local 7902. In 2017, they voted to form a union and went on strike in 2018. They won a contract with the New School. During the COVID-19 pandemic, New School part-time faculty voted to ratify a pandemic recovery plan. In 2022, contract negotiations began for New School and New York University adjunct teachers.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
<p>In 2013, http://www.actuaw.org/ was initially selected by curators and captured through the use of The California Digital Library's Web Archiving Service in 2013 as part of the Labor Unions and Organizations (U.S.) Web Archive. In November 2015, the website was migrated to Archive-It. Archive-It uses web crawling technology to capture websites at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy, from the resulting WARC file, of the website. In May 2022, https://youarethenewschool.com/ was added. The accession number associated with this website is 2022.062.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head>
<p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl. Certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content. Full-Text searches of archived websites are available at https://archive-it.org/organizations/567.</p>  </phystech>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>The collection was maintained by Nicole Greenhouse. Maintenance of the collection consisted of rescoping due to missing captured content, redirects and content drift, missing embedded materials (such as videos or attached Google documents and pdfs), and other materials created by selected entities. The finding aid was created in July 2022.</p>  </processinfo>
