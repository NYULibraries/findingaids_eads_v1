    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p><emph render="italic">Beyond the Pale</emph> was a radio program produced and hosted by Esther Kaplan and Marilyn Kleinberg Neimark on New York's WBAI Radio, part of the Pacifica Radio Network. The show ran steadily from 1995 to 2014 and explored local, national, and international political debate and analysis from a Jewish perspective. Produced with the support of the New York City-based Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ), <emph render="italic">Beyond the Pale</emph> included discussions on contemporary Jewish culture from a leftist perspective with writers, filmmakers, musicians, critics, and political organizers.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>In 2017, <emph render="italic">Beyond the Pale</emph> engaged archivist, curator, and historian, Rachel Mattson, to prepare the collection for donation. Mattson performed a collection assessment and developed an inventory of the collection which was supplied to NYU.</p><p>At the time of receipt in 2017, materials were originally housed in boxes grouped by years. At the time of accessioning, materials were moved into archival housing and a collection-level record was created to describe contents. Materials were also arranged by format and then grouped chronologically. Between the accession of these materials and processing, a small number of the materials were digitized. </p><p>During processing in 2019, materials were physically arranged to ensure chronological order by year in each format grouping. Undated materials were arranged at the end of each format grouping. ¼-inch audio reels were rehoused, and descriptive notations and labels from the original housing were transcribed. Housing with extensive notations were photocopied and filed in the "Audiovisual Documentation" folder (Box 33, Folder 1) with new unique identification numbers inscribed. A file-level inventory was created during processing to provide informative description of each audiovisual carrier. The titles were derived from original annotations on the physical media with enhancements from original inventory descriptions where appropriate. New archivist-designated identifiers were assigned to each item and physically attached to cases. If available, each title includes the original unique identifier created and provided by the creators (e.g., [1998-024]).</p><p>The optical discs were forensically imaged and analyzed, of which eight failed to image successfully. Of the eight, three were completely unreadable and deaccessioned. The <emph render="italic">Beyond the Pale</emph> website was archived to the Internet Archive using the Archive-It service. New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p><p>During processing in 2019, the website was archived and added to the finding aid.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The <emph render="italic">Beyond the Pale</emph> Records contains an archived website, audiocassettes, ¼-inch audio reels, DATs, MiniDiscs, and CD-Rs of <emph render="italic">Beyond the Pale</emph> audio recordings, which include air-checks, recordings of live broadcasts, events, and audio used as source material. Materials in the collection date from from 1967 to 2019 with the bulk of materials dating 1995-2014. The recordings in this collection document the discussions and debates surrounding both major world events and events in the history of progressive Jewish activism for nearly 20 years. The episodes cover Jewish culture, politics, and social issues, and though the programs are generally based on progressive concerns, the opinions expressed on the program represent viewpoints from not only the political left, but the right as well. Many programs focus on issues surrounding the Middle East conflict, U.S.-Israel and U.S.-Palestinian relations, and the recordings document the development of these issues over nearly two decades. There are interviews with many significant artists, scholars, activists, and politicians, such as Grace Paley, Adrienne Rich, Dr. Ruchama Marton, Michel Warschawski, Rabbi Arthur Waskow, Dr. Tal Jarus-Hakak, and others. The program covered discussions on many contemporary subjects within the American Jewish community including domestic abuse, LGBTQ issues, Jewish identity, the prison-industrial complex, and Jews and the religious right. The radio program also explored a number of historical events and their impacts on the present, such as the history of Jewish involvement in radical politics and labor activism, the trial and execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, Jewish life in Eastern Europe and the USSR, and the Ocean Hill-Brownsville battle over community control of public schools in the late 1960s. Frequent contributors to and co-hosts of the program include Henry Foner, Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz, Nan Rubin, Alisa Solomon, Josh Nathan-Kazis, and Abe Velez. Besides the October 2019 capture of the <emph render="italic">Beyond the Pale</emph> website (https://www.beyondthepale.org), there are additional captures by the WayBack Machine between 2008 and 2018.</p>  </scopecontent>

The radio programs were posted online on Beyond the Pale's website between 2003-2014, where listeners could read about and stream aired episodes. While there have been no new posts since 2014, and the streaming capability of the website no longer works, the website still contains information about the program and information about each episode.  The program's website featured short biographies of hosts and personnel, a blog, an online shop selling mugs and CDs, and information on how to donate to/volunteer for WBAI and Beyond the Pale.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_e1c485000d18b91b06666d8086c465bd"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl.
