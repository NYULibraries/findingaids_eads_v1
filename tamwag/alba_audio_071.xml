      <abstract id="aspace_cf9600814f6f8b39398c5d5df287d552">David Miller (1908-1977), a lawyer from
        the Bronx, sailed for Spain as a volunteer for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in April 1938. In
        the course the war he conducted radio broadcasts from Albacete and Madrid for the Voice of
        Spain. While in Spain he trained at Madrigueras and Tarazona with Edward Lending
        (1912-2003), another Lincoln Brigade volunteer. Lending later served in the United States
        Army during World War II. Vincent Lossowski (1914- 1984) fought with the Lincoln Brigade in
        the Spanish Civil War and served with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in World War
        II, organizing anti-Nazi guerilla actions under the direction of General William Donovan. He
        had met Lending in Spain and they remained friends. The collection consists of 13
        audiocassettes, of two interviews conducted by David Miller with his friends and fellow
        vets, Lending and Lossowski. The discussion focuses on how they came to join the
        International Brigades, their experiences in Spain, and what happened after they returned.

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The collection consists of 13 audiocassettes. They contain two interviews conducted by
        David Miller in response to a project initiated by Victor Berch, the archivist for the
        Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) collection when it was housed at Brandeis University (before
        2001). Berch was interested in recording autobiographical data on as many International
        Briagdes veterans as he could. Lincoln Brigade veteran David Miller decided to assist in
        this project by interviewing his friends and fellow veterans, Edward Lending and Vincent
        Lossowski. The taped discussions focus on how they came to join the Lincoln Brigade, their
        experiences in Spain, and what happened after they returned. Six of the tapes are of Lending
        alone, and the other seven have both Lossowski and Lending speaking (with the main focus on
        Lossowski). Partial transcripts are available for both interviews. The transcript of the
        Lossowski/Lending interview is in the John Gerassi Papers (ALBA 18). The interview of Edward
        Lending alone is in the Lending Papers (ALBA 68), which also contains extensive
        correspondence between Lending and David Miller discussing the upcoming interview and what
        would be done with it, their mutual interest in Israel, and their views on the leadership of
        the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Briagade.</p>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>David Miller (1908-1977), a lawyer from the Bronx, joined the Communist Party in 1932 and
        sailed for Spain in April 1938. In the course the war he conducted radio broadcasts from
        Albacete and Madrid for the Voice of Spain. While in Spain he trained at Madrigueras and
        Tarazona with Edward Lending. After returning from Spain he split form the Communist Party.
        He found himself in a state of tension with the leaders of the Veterans of the Abraham
        Lincoln Brigade (VALB) and for a period was out of contact with the organization. He was
        close with Fredericka Martin and helped her with research and encouragement on her book
        about the American Medical Bureau’s activities in Spain. He took a great interest in the
        VALB archive at Brandeis University and was in touch with the archivist Victor Berch. Miller
        was also a supporter of Israel and bonded in this area with fellow Vet Edward Lending. A
        dream of his was to visit Israel and record the life stories of the Spanish veterans living
        there; unfortunately he passed before this could occur.</p>
      <p>Edward Isaac Lending (1912-2003) fought with the International Brigades in Spain and later
        served in the United States Army during World War II. After returning to the U.S. in
        December 1938, Lending became a member of the Executive Board of the Veterans of the Abraham
        Brigade (VALB).While Lending had been devoted to the Communist Party between 1935 and 1943,
        his disillusionment with policy dictated by Soviet Party leadership had been growing at
        least since the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 to the point where he completely severed
        ties with the Party in 1943. Around this time Lending also grew critical of the VALB
        organization for what he perceived to be its rigid political orthodoxy. Another effort to
        which Lending devoted much time and energy was raising awareness of Jewish participation in
        the Spanish Civil War. In this he found a partner in David Miller.</p>
      <p>Vincent Lossowski (1914- 1984) fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil
        War and served with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in World War II under the
        direction of General William Donovan helping to organize anti-Nazi guerrilla actions. He
        left the Army with the rank of captain in 1945 and was presented with the Legion of Merit.
        In the 1950s Lossowski was investigated by a Congressional Military Affairs Subcommittee
        because of his activities in Spain and his ongoing association with the Veterans of the
        Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). In his later years, Lossowski granted interviews and gave
        lectures to local college groups about the International Brigades and American participation
        in the Spanish Civil War. He remained an active member of VALB until his death in 1984 at
        the age of 70. He had met Lending in Spain and they remained friends.</p>
