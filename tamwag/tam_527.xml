            <abstract id="ref814" label="Abstract">David Sullivan (19xx-2006) was active in the U.S. Maoist movement and collected organizational records, personal papers, printed ephemera, posters, and other materials pertaining thereto. He also became a repository for donations from individuals and organizations affiliated with the U.S. Marxist-Leninist-Maoist tradition. The collection contains materials that document what is referred to as the New Communist Movement. Segments of the collection pertain to the Revolutionary Union (RU), the Bay Area Revolutionary Union, the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters (RWH), and the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) (CPML). The collection traces the internal debates of these organizations, their mergers and splits, as well as their organizational campaigns from the early 1970s through 1982. While it is unclear as to Sullivan’s precise affiliation with these organizations, from the material present, it is certain that he was involved in union organizing with both the United Autoworkers and the United Steelworkers of America in the mid- to late 1970s. Subject files from various individuals highlight work with the National Lawyers Guild, Vietnam Veterans Against the War, and in struggles for women’s rights. The collection also consists of a wide selection of both buttons and posters, which compliment the organizations represented in the collection’s extensive series of printed ephemera from other U.S. Marxist-Leninist-Maoist organizations.</abstract>

            <p>The David Sullivan U.S. Maoism Collection contains internal material and printed ephemera documenting the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist tradition in the United States. Four groups central to the milieu, and whose material is heavily represented in the collection are the Revolutionary Union (RU), the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters (RWH), a breakaway faction of the RCP, and the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) (CPML). Each of these organizations produced district and national bulletins, fliers, and other printed material that can be found in the collection. Throughout Series I-IV, which document these four organizations are internal materials related to pertinent debates, including folders on the international situation and the Gang of Four in China following the death of Mao Tsetung in 1976, party building, revisionism, and trade union strategies. Also included is correspondence between the organizations on their various efforts to unite all Marxist-Leninists. The Collection also contains a sizable amount of printed and other ephemera from hundreds of leftist organizations. In addition to brochures, fliers, pamphlets, and publications, there are also buttons and posters. The organizations are wide ranging from local event based coalitions to national groups like the Black Workers Congress and the Communist Party of the USA, generally these organizations are U.S. based.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>David Sullivan (19xx-1006) spent his youth engaged in progressive and radical politics in New York City. His parents were both liberal Democrats and his father was a professor of Psychology at New York University. Sullivan attended PS 41 for junior high and enrolled in high school on the Lower East Side of Manhattan at Seward Park High School; he was an activist in both schools. During high school, the anti-Vietnam war movement was ablaze in New York City and around the country. Sullivan considered himself on the left-wing, anti-imperialist end of the movement. In 1967 when Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at Riverside Church in New York, Sullivan was a marshal for the 5th Avenue Peace Parade Committee. He affiliated himself with the Youth Against War and Fascism and helped to found the Seward Park Peace and Freedom Coalition. Sullivan was also active in the high school student union and published a student paper. Additionally, he acted as a "scout" during the Spring Mobilization for Peace activities of 1968, where he rode his bike around Washington Square Park and used pay phones to spread information on the whereabouts of the police. Sullivan was eventually arrested in Washington Square.</p>
            <p>When King was assassinated in April 1968, Sullivan was attending an anti-war meeting. He immediately produced a leaflet in support of the MLK memorial and organized students at his school to go. Sullivan marched to the principle’s office demanding that the school be shut down for the memorial. When the principle declined, the students marched out anyway. Sullivan continued to be involved in radical politics throughout his time in high school. Acting as part of a liberated school at Seward Park that was established during the Teacher's Union strike of 1969, Sullivan was arrested again.</p>
            <p>David Sullivan attended college in Yellow Springs, Ohio at Antioch College. He was involved with Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and continued to be an anti-war, anti-imperialist activist. Sullivan, however, like many students grew disillusioned with the youth movement and turned to the teachings of Marx, Lenin, and Mao. SDS was going through massive splits at the time. One splinter group of SDS was the Revolutionary Youth Movement II, known as RYM-II. RYM-II eventually fractured into two major groups, one led by Mike Klonsky was the October League, the other led by Bob Avakian was known as the Bay Area Revolutionary Union.</p>
            <p>The David Sullivan U.S. Maoism Collection consists of the internal and public documents of four organizations central to the Marxist-Leninist tradition in the United States: the Revolutionary Union, the Revolutionary Communist Party, The Revolutionary Workers Headquarters, and the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist). Sullivan was involved with the groups following his work with SDS at Antioch. These organizations have origins in the student activism of the late 1960s. The relationships between the four organizations are filled with splits and mergers, which are outlined throughout the collection.</p>
            <p>The origins of the Revolutionary Union (RU) lay with the formation of the Bay Area Revolutionary Union (BARU) in 1968 by Bob Avakian and Steve Hamilton. BARU had units in San Francisco, Oakland-Berkeley, Richmond, and Palo Alto, California. The group initiated the Richmond Workers Committee, which played a support role during the Standard Oil strike of 1969. In the early 1970s, the BARU wanted to grow into a larger, more nationalized organization and went on a United States tour to gain membership. Sullivan found out about the RU through this tour; he joined a collective of the Revolutionary Union in Ohio circa the early 1970s. Sullivan then went to work for ALCOA Steel Corporation in Cleveland as part of his work with the RU.</p>
            <p>The Revolutionary Union in the East Coast helped to form the November 4th Coalition, which organized an anti-imperialist demonstration in New York City in 1973. The RU also helped to run a workers conference the following year in March. The group continued to act throughout the 1970s, for instance on campaigns against Nixon, such as the "Throw the Bum Out" campaign, but also on the national energy crisis and with postal workers in an organization called Outlaw.</p>
            <p>The RU, through its district and national bulletins, focused on developing a central task for the organization. The Revolutionary Union was concerned not only with developing this central task but also the methodology through which it was achieved. Through these bulletins the RU wrote extensively on summing up campaigns and putting forth political lines. Important issues for the Revolutionary Union included trade union organizing, black liberation, the national question, the international situation, and building a United Front Against Imperialism. They produced the widely circulated 
                <emph render="italic">Red Papers</emph>, which functioned as a theoretical journal for Marxist-Leninists.</p>
            <p>In 1975, the Revolutionary Union founded the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). This new formation was in line with the Union's central task of party building. Bob Avakian continued to be a leading figure within the RCP. The RCP supported the domestic and foreign policies of the People's Republic of China until Mao's death in 1976. They opposed what they saw as revisionist, social imperialist policies of the Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>Two years after the 1976 overthrow of the Gang of Four in China, the RCP split. The majority, led by Avakian, felt that the Chinese government had adopted revisionist policies, while the minority, which supported the present regime of the Chinese Communist Party, established the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters.</p>
            <p>In the mid-1970s, the Party opposed busing, affirmative action, and black nationalism, believing them to be non-revolutionary policies. To demonstrate against U.S. expansionist policies they briefly occupied the Alamo. They were instrumental in the organization of the National United Workers Organization and the Unemployed Workers Organizing Committee. In the late 1970s, the RCP shifted its concentration from heavy industry toward youth and immigrant workers. In 1982, after a three-year court battle, 17 members, the Mao Tsetung Defendants, were acquitted of felony charges for alleged violence at a demonstration in Washington, D.C. In 1989 the RCP won a supreme court ruling that flag burning falls under protection of the first amendment. Since 1975, they have published 
                <emph render="italic">The Worker</emph>.</p>
            <p>The Revolutionary Workers Headquarters (RWH) formed a minority faction within the RCP, disagreeing with leadership in the RCP over the politics and policies of the Chinese Communist Party. The RWH officially separated from the RCP in 1977, as announced in their publication, 
                <emph render="italic">Voices of the Rebellion</emph>. The RWH was involved in much the same struggles as the RCP, concerned with organizing workers and the unemployed, and forming an anti-imperialist revolutionary organization. They too focused on the national question and the international situation. Much of their work, as reflected in the material, pertained to uniting Marxist-Leninists, believed to be a central task of revolutionaries. They had merger negotiations with the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), the Proletarian Unity League, the Bay Area Communist Union, and the League of Revolutionary Struggle.</p>
            <p>The Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) (CPML), originally known as the October League, was founded in 1971. Michael Klonsky, active with Students for a Democratic Society, was a primary figure of the CPML. The Party published the influential and widely read newspaper, 
                <emph render="italic">The Call</emph>. The central task of the October League was party building and uniting Marxist-Leninists in a united front against imperialism. They engaged in lengthy merger talks with the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters during the late 1970s and into the 1980s.</p>
            <p>David Sullivan, though not directly involved with every organization represented in the collection, became a repository for materials related to the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist tradition. Various individuals and organizations donated their papers to him. These, along with material he created and collected, make up the bulk of the collection.</p>

                    <p>Series I contains material generated by and about the Revolutionary Union and its local collectives, including the leading Bay Area Revolutionary Union. The material ranges in date from 1970-1978 and is divided by committee, local, district, and regional, as well as by subject and format. While a portion of this Series is printed and public and includes calendars, fliers, national and district bulletins, pamphlets and publications, a majority is internal. There are drafts of the Revolutionary Union’s theoretical paper, 
                        <emph render="italic">Red Papers 5</emph> and 
                        <emph render="italic">6</emph> as well as position papers on factionalism and developing the political line of the working class. Of note are folders concerning among other things: the expulsion from the Revolutionary Union of Bruce Franklin, his wife Jane Franklin, and Janet Weiss, a history of the East Coast Regional, and correspondence regarding the RU’s security measures and stance on gay liberation. There are also folders with material about the Revolutionary Union’s stance on the 1972 McGovern Presidential campaign, as well as their positions on party building, democratic centralism, and recruitment. Material pertaining to the Revolutionary Union’s political campaigns surrounding farm workers, international women’s day, may day, students, tenants, trade unions, the unemployed, and veterans is evident in this Series.</p>

                    <p>Series II contains material generated by and about the Revolutionary Communist Party and dates from the Party’s founding in 1975 up through 1982. Material is divided by committee and district as well as topic and format. While a portion of this Series is printed and public, including district and national bulletins, constitutions, fliers, pamphlets, and publications, it largely consists of internal documents. Folders contain drafts and memos on central topics such as busing, China and the Gang of Four, Iran, political education, students, and trade union organizing. Of note are folders containing material related to the founding congress, including committee reports and resolutions as well as main political reports, the split with the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters, and speeches from the Mao Tsetung Memorial in 1976. Material from the Revolutionary Communist Party’s political work surrounding International Women’s Day, the July 4th Bicentennial, and May Day is represented in this Series with fliers, drafts, and political reports. There is also material related to the RCP’s involvement in organizing with the National United Workers Organization, the Unemployed Workers Organizing Committee, and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.</p>

                    <p>Series III contains material generated by and about the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters, a faction of the Revolutionary Communist Party that broke away following the downfall of the Gang of Four in China in 1976. Material in this Series dates from the organization’s formation in 1977, including its paper 
                        <emph render="italic">Voices of the Rebellion</emph>, which announces the group’s separation from the RCP and goes through 1984. In this Series, material is divided by district, committee, and regional as well as by topic and format. While a portion of this Series is printed and public, including district and national bulletins, fliers, journals, and pamphlets, the majority consists of internal documents. Folders contain drafts and memos on such pertinent topics as, agitation and propaganda relating to the development of a organizational newspaper, the black national question, busing in Boston, Cook County Hospital, the equal rights amendment, fusion between the workers movement and the social movement, the international situation mostly pertaining to the situation in China following the death of Mao Tsetung and the Three Worlds Theory, the national question, and the woman question. Of note are lengthy itineraries, reports, and correspondence from a visit to China in 1979-1980. The Boston, Chicago, and New York City districts are most heavily represented in this Series. Folders outlining the RWH’s political campaigns surrounding African Liberation Day and May Day contain fliers and reports. Central to this Series is the RWH’s work with uniting Marxist-Leninists in the United States. There are folders outlining lengthy merger discussions with the Bay Area Communist Union, the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), the Committee to Unite Marxist Leninists, and the League of Revolutionary Struggle. At times discussions lasted over the course of several years. Heavily important to the RWH was its work in trade unions and the trade union movement. There is a sizable amount of material in this Series, which outlines various trade union strategies and involvement in the auto, electrical, mining, and steel industries.</p>

                    <p>Series IV contains material generated by the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) (CPML), which dates from 1976 when the organization changed its name from the October League up through 1981. While there are public and printed documents in this Series in the way of district and national bulletins and pamphlets from 
                        <emph render="italic">The Call</emph> and Call Publications, most of the material is internal. A large portion of this Series is made up of reports from various districts and regionals. These consist of page long, occasionally hand-written briefs outlining political campaigns and recruitment work going on in the CPML’s districts and regionals around the country. Another sizable portion of this Series consists of notebooks filled with minutes and notes from meetings of the Political Bureau and the Standing Committee. There are a number of folders containing material from the CPML’s commissions and fractions, including the Afro-American, National Trade Union, and National Women’s Commissions and the Azanian Support, National Lawyers Guild, and the Southern Conference Education Fund Fractions. Of note in this Series is material pertaining to the expulsion of Martin Nicolaus as well as a resignation letter from civil rights activist Lyn Wells. Like Series III, there is material related to various merger negotiations amongst U.S. Marxist-Leninist organizations, including the Revolutionary Workers Headquarters and the New Voice.</p>

                    <p>Series V contains material related to the union organizing work of David Sullivan. It is presumed that these materials relate to work he himself engaged with, but there could also be material related to work he simply collected on. The Series is broken down by union, first the United Autoworkers and then the United Steelworkers of America. This Series highlights the activities of rank and file activists within these two unions and their various locals. Material from the United Autoworkers largely comes from the ALCOA plant in Cleveland and includes a folder of grievances that Sullivan filed with the union. There are numerous locals represented from the United Steelworkers of America, most with small runs of bulletins and newsletters from rank and file activists within the local. These include Local 1014’s
                        <emph render="italic"> Coke Plant Breeze</emph> and the 
                        <emph render="italic">Mill Hunk Herald</emph>. Political fliers and brochures related to the campaign of James Balanoff for President of District 31 are found in this Series as well as material related to other union election campaigns.</p>

                    <p>Series VI consists of files of material identified by subject. These files contain clippings, minutes and notes from meetings, pamphlets, and other publications related to the topic at hand. The handwritten minutes and notes within these files suggest that the creator of them was involved with the organizations represented, such as the National Lawyers Guild and the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. The other major subject represented in the files is related to women’s rights generally, abortion and the equal rights amendment more specifically. Of particular note, this Series contains material related to a fundraising effort of David Sullivan, whereby he was selling the poetry of influential communist Leibel Bergman in order to raise money for Bergman’s bills. Volumes of Bergman’s poetry can be found here, as well as a part of his FBI file.</p>

                    <p>Series VII makes up the largest portion of the collection and contains folders of material documenting the printed and public matter produced by hundreds of U.S. leftist organizations. Contained within the files are brochures, fliers, pamphlets, and other publications. A majority of the organizations were affiliated with the U.S. Marxist-Leninist-Maoist tradition, such as the August 29th Movement, the Bay Area Communist Union, the Black Workers Congress, Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and the October League.</p>

                    <p>Series VIII contains hundreds of political buttons collected by David Sullivan. The buttons document campaigns by many of the organizations represented within Series I-VII and range in date from 1965-1984, though the majority are undated. There is a large selection of buttons with Chinese Communist Party symbols – red stars, hammers, and sickles, as well as pictures of Mao Tsetung. Buttons document congressional political campaigns in addition to events surrounding African Liberation Day, numerous boycotts, civil rights, gay rights, May Day, the Vietnam War, and the women’s movement. A number of groups such as the Industrial Workers of the World, the Revolutionary Student Brigade, and the Unemployed Workers Organizing Committee have buttons in the collection. There are also buttons from unions and union elections. These come from the Communications Workers of America, the United Autoworkers, the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, and the United Steelworkers of America. Of note are three buttons, housed in a commemorative box, from the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union (1918), a National Hunger March (1932), and the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (1937).</p>

                    <p>Series X consists of the artifactual items found in the David Sullivan U.S. Maoism Collection. These are described at the folder, and at times, item level. Much of the material in this Series pertains to China and the Chinese Communist Party. There are several maps, sets of postcards, and travel guides pertaining to a presumed trip to China. There are also a number of visually striking scrolls, which depict scenes in China often involving communism and communist leaders.</p>
