            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Eugene L. Armbruster (1865 - 1943) was born in Baden-Baden, Germany, and came to the United States in 1882. His first job was with H. Henkel Cigar Box Manufacturing Company, where he continued to work until his retirement in 1920. He lived in Bushwick, Brooklyn, with his wife and two children, Julia and Eugene Jr.</p>
            <p>Armbruster took photographs beginning in the late 19th century, but the majority of his work is from the 1910s and 1920s. Around the time of his retirement, Armbruster became interested in local history and began to photograph his environs in earnest, specifically the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. He took thousands of photographs of historic houses, churches, streetscapes, and buildings throughout New York City and Long Island.</p>
            <p>Beginning around 1915, Armbruster wrote for the "Old-Timer" column of the Brooklyn Eagle. He honed his knowledge of local history through reading and extensive walking throughout the streets he was documenting. A majority of his photographs are annotated with historical information. He sought the rural environments linked to the past, turning to the rural counties of Long Island after the towns and neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens started growing and modernizing in the early 1920s. From 1914 to 1929, Armbruster published several pamphlets about local history, which he illustrated with his own line drawings, copy photos, and original photographs. In the 1930s, he published three pamphlets on language and its origins, seemingly a new interest.</p>
            <p>He was forced to give up photography around 1940 after he developed cataracts on his eyes. He died on September 21, 1943.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Eugene L. Armbruster Photograph Collection includes approximately 5,000 black and white gelatin silver prints, approximately 3,500 acetate film negatives; approximately 1,400 nitrate film negatives; four 4 x 5" glass negatives; 235 5 x 7" glass negatives; 230 6.5 x 8.5" glass negatives; and 48 8 x 10" glass negatives.</p>
            <p>The collection spans the period from 1894-1939 and contains photographic views of New York State, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New England, and Canada. Most of the photographs show New York City, especially Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island. These images document many structures that no longer exist, and in some cases may be the only extant photographic record. The collection is arranged into two series based on format: Prints and Negatives. The prints and negatives have not been matched to each other, although there are most likely many corresponding positives and negatives in the collection. Within each series, subseries are arranged by size or material, and thereunder alphabetically by state, and then by. Within New York State, the photos of New York City and Long Island are divided into county and then by neighborhood.</p>
            <p>Series I. Prints is divided into the following subseries: Prints: 3.5 x 4.5" (and smaller); Prints: 5 x 7"; and Mounted Prints. Most prints are annotated in some manner on the verso. Some prints have Armbruster's map on the verso, showing the exact location of the building/house. Often he has included historical information on the house or building and in some cases he has added notes such as "still standing 1929."</p>
            <p>The majority of photographs were taken after Armbruster's retirement in 1920. Earlier photographs are generally of New York City or nearby counties in New Jersey. With time on his hands, Armbruster traveled out of New York City, and those trips are well documented here. In July, 1925, for example, Armbruster traveled throughout New York State, New England, and Canada. It is notable that these photographs reflect only historic buildings and sites, not family or leisure shots.</p>
            <p>Many of the Brooklyn and Queens photos (and all of the 5 x 7" prints) date from 1922. Most of the subjects no longer exist, mainly due to a building boom in the boroughs in the late 1920s. In some cases Armbruster seems to have been aware of demolition plans, and photographed houses for just that reason. The views of Brooklyn are also notable for their almost exclusive focus on historical sites and subjects. Other photographs of the borough from a similar time period often show modern improvements, such as elevated rail tracks, automobiles, industry and skyscrapers. Armbruster organized his Brooklyn photos in groups according to the six original towns in the county: Brooklyn, Bushwick, Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend and New Utrecht.</p>
            <p>Notable Brooklyn structures pictured include Holland School, Lefferts Farm, and Packer Collegiate Institute. Other commercial buildings shown are grocery stores, engine houses, gymnasiums, banks, hotels, cigar stores, a tollhouse on Flatbush Avenue, florists, and a blacksmith and wheelwright shop.</p>
            <p>Brooklyn residences include the homes of the following notable Brooklyn residents: Treadwell Abrams, Wynant Bennett, Fenwick Bergen, Jeremiah Bergen, John L. Bergen; Horace B. Claflin, Samuel Coland, Charles Ekoch, Joseph Fleming, John Franklin, Joseph Golden, Joseph Herrings, John F. James, Horatio King, Johannes Lott, Judge Ganet L. Martense, Henry Evelyn Pierrepont (1808-1888), W. A. Putnam, Derick Remsen, Johannes Remsen, James S. Rockwell, John J. Ryder, John F. Ryerson, John Schenk, Moses Snydaw, David D. Stillwell, Colonel David M. Stone (1817-1895), Charles Strohm, Spencer Trask, Rutgert Joosten Van Brunt, John H. Van Cleef, John L. Van Pelt, John J. Vanderbilt (d. 1842), Daniel D. Whitney, Lionel Wilbur, and Garrett Williams.</p>
            <p>Churches in Brooklyn shown include: Central Presbyterian Church, Church of the New Jerusalem, Emanuel Protestant Episcopal Church, First Presbyterian Church, First Unitarian Church of Our Savior, Grace Church, Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church, New Utrecht Reformed Dutch Church, Plymouth Church, Reform Church on the Heights, St. John's Lutheran Church, St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church, and St. Paul's Episcopal Church.</p>
            <p>Series II. Negatives is arranged in five subseries: Acetate Film Negatives: 4 x 5"; Nitrate Film Negatives: 5 x 7"; Glass Plate Negatives: 5 x 7" (and smaller); Glass Plate Negatives: 6.5 x 8.5"; and Glass Plate Negatives: 8 x 10".</p>
            <p>Negatives are arranged by geographic location, if known, as described above. Subject terms found in the Thesaurus for Graphic Material (Library of Congress: 1995) have been utilized to further organize negatives beyond geographical divisions. Photograph topics fall into the following categories: architectural elements, automobiles, barns, boats, buildings, churches, dams, farmhouses, interiors, landscapes, people, row houses, streets, and windmills.</p>
            <p>Featured buildings in Subseries IV: Glass Plate Negatives: 6.5 x 8.5," include: the Abbey Pub, the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn Waterworks, the Bushwick Hospital, Federal Courts Building, Fort Greene Tobacco Works, Mansion House, the Packer Collegiate Institute, and Underhill's Colonnade Buildings (on edge of Brooklyn Heights). Other commercial buildings shown are hotels, a horse-shoeing shop, ferry terminals, flour mills, printing offices, public school, race courses, a saw manufacturer, and several theaters. Among the churches shown are: Bushwick Church, First Reformed Church, Grace Church, New Utrecht Church, Old Assumption Church, Old St. Ann's Protestant Episcopal Church, Plymouth Church, St. James Roman Catholic Church, and St. Mark's Episcopal Church.</p>
            <p>Houses shown in Subseries IV include those of: Thomas Bennett; Dewitt Clinton; Seth Low, mayor of Brooklyn and New York City; the Schermerhorn family; the Van Brunt family; and Mayor (of Williamsburgh) William Wall. Other views of interest are: a circular, dated October 1, 1869, announcing the opening of Wechsler and Abraham Clothing Store; the City of Williamsburgh Seal; and an October 3, 1860 Brooklyn survey map.</p>

                        <p>Subseries II is made up primarily of Brooklyn scenes. The prints are almost all labeled by Armbruster with the names of the original owner of the house, and of the notable people who lived in it; often the exact street address is noted. Armbruster sometimes noted on the back of prints when structures were torn down; most of these semi-rural houses have since been demolished. Neighborhoods (formerly separate towns) are noted, other prints marked "Brooklyn" mainly correspond to downtown Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights. These prints generally correspond to the 5 x 7" Glass Plate Negatives in Series II, Subseries III, although there are unmatched prints and negatives.</p>

                        <p>Subseries I is housed in envelopes, which are grouped by geographic region. The number of negatives in each grouping is listed in parentheses after the geographical location. These negatives seem to correspond, however roughly, to groupings of prints in Series I. It is probable that the geographic names found on each envelope were transferred from titles on the original film boxes. These envelopes are numbered; the number seems to correspond to their original physical placement in a cabinet in the N-YHS library stacks.</p>

                        <p>Subseries II is composed mainly of views of residential houses, including some of Brooklyn row houses. Most of these photographs appear to be on Long Island; many shots show wooden, farm-like houses. The same scene is often shown in several negatives. A churchyard in East Hampton is pictured with an elaborate sepulchre. Windmills are shown for many of the Long Island towns. Several of the negative boxes had Armbruster's notation on the geographical location of negative subjects. The negatives in the boxes which lacked any notation have been arranged by general subject category.</p>
                        <p>Nitrate negatives were interleaved with acid free paper and stored five to a negative sleeve. Several of the negative boxes had Armbruster's notation on geographical place of negatives. These negatives are grouped by geography after Armbruster's titles (which appear in quotation marks) and then further divided by subject. Many other boxes had no notation. These negatives were arranged by general subject category. Nitrate negatives were assigned box numbers in coordination with other nitrate negatives held by the New-York Historical Society. These negatives are located on Floor 14 in the N-YHS Library Stacks. (See also, Separated Material)</p>

                        <p>Subseries III generally corresponds to prints found in Series I, Subseries II. All were taken in Brooklyn in 1922. When possible, negatives have been matched to prints and titled accordingly. When no print was available, a bracketed descriptive title was assigned to each negative. Negatives are not numbered, but are ordered geographically. Within each geographic designation, negatives are arranged loosely by subject: Buildings, Churches, Houses, and Other.</p>

                        <p>Subseries IV includes copy negatives from Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, the Brooklyn Eagle, engravings, oil paintings, pen and ink drawings; mainly of historic houses or buildings in Brooklyn. Many of these look as if Armbruster had pinned them to a board for enlarging purposes. The pins and board are visible in some of the negatives. There are also enlargements in this same manner of several of Armbruster's own prints. Copy negatives carry either Armbruster's or the original captions (and sometimes both). In cases where no caption was written on the negative, a bracketed descriptive title was assigned to each negative. Original negatives are grouped together and organized by subject.

                        <p>Subseries V contains mainly copy negatives. These consist of drawings of historic houses (some from newspapers or magazines.) and other views such as: Long Island Rail Road Tunnel; a map of the City of Williamsburgh; Old James Street Market, Brooklyn; View of Astoria, L.I. (printed by Currier and Ives); and Rutgers University. Original negatives show Ebbets field, the Manhattan skyline, Union Cemetary, and Armbruster's family tree. When no title was available, a bracketed descriptive title was assigned to each negative. Negatives are not numbered. Original negatives are grouped together and organized by subject. Copy negatives are also grouped together and organized by subject. Some broken negatives are in Box 35.</p>
