    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes 82 black and white photographs by Fons Iannelli.  Nine of the photographs are 8x11 inches and depict various New York City views, including river views, parks, and buildings (including the World Trade Center Twin Towers). The other 73 photographs are 11x14 inch prints. Most of these (41) are of women in labor, holding newborn children, and what appear to be related photographs of couples at work, at home, and shopping in the period leading up to the childbirths. Ten photographs are said by the donor to be of the Rutland Dress Company. Three photographs are captioned as having been taken for Fortune in December 1947 for the "Madison Ave" story. Finally, there are seven views of the area around Pennsylvania Station in Midtown, six of the lobby at Lincoln Center, five of people window shopping, and one shopping for a dress.</p><p>Many of the photographs sre stamped on the back with Iannelli's name, sometimes also referring to "Scope." But most of the photographs have no identifying stamps or captions. The collection does not include any of Iannelli's World War II photographs from the Pacific theater.</p>  </scopecontent>
