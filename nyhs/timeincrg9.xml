			<head>Historical Note</head>
			<p>For the majority of Time Inc.'s existence, the company maintained a strict separation of editorial from the publishing and business side of each magazine, colloquially called the separation of "church" (editorial) and "state" (publishing). Editorial includes the editors, researchers, and art department. The editorial side reported up to the editor-in-chief and the publishing/business side reported up to the corporate business executive which was the president prior to 1960 and the chief executive officer after. Henry Luce structured Time Inc. this way so that the business side could not (in theory) influence the editorial content of the publications. For example, the advertising sales people could not interfere with a magazine's decision to run an article on the dangers of cigarette smoking, even though it might mean losing millions of dollars in tobacco ads.</p>
			<p>Time Inc. published the first issue of <title render="italic">Life</title> on November 23, 1936. In the initial proposal to the board, the specifications were that it would be the same size as the <title render="italic">Illustrated London News</title>, printed on shiny paper with around 200 high-quality photographs recording significant current news events including detailed captions. Because the suggested price would be 10 cents per issue, the initial title was <title render="italic">Dime, The Show-Book of the World</title>. According to Elson, staff and charter subscribers were asked to submit other names, and the title <title render="italic">Life</title> was suggested by both cofounder Henry Luce's wife Clare Luce and Time Inc. president James Linen's father. Since the name was already in use by another publication, Luce purchased it in order to acquire the rights. </p>
			<p>The first staff members in 1936 were Luce as managing editor with John Martin as an alternate, Daniel Longwell as picture editor, Alfred Eisenstaedt and Peter Stackpole as staff photographers, and Mary Fraser as copy chief.</p>
			<p>For financial reasons, Time Inc. suspended production of <title render="italic">Life</title> as a weekly magazine in December 1972, but began planning a revival almost immediately. The Magazine Development department published the first <title render="italic">Life</title> special in 1973 as a newsstand magazine followed by nine more. Time Inc. revived <title render="italic">Life</title> as a monthly in 1978. In 2000, publication was again suspended, but revived in 2004 as a newspaper supplement. In 2007, Time Inc. completely ceased printing of <title render="italic">Life</title> and created a website for images from the collection.</p>

					<p>Records includes correspondence and subject files from Ralph Graves during his tenure as Managing Editor of <title render="italic">Life</title> spanning from 1968 to 1973 documenting editorial content and story selection, background information on articles, and the publication process. Some files are from his prior position as Senior Staff Editor.</p>
					<p>The general correspondence contains primarily letters from readers including article suggestions and letters from children as school assignments; invitations; and some correspondence with other Time Inc. departments. Items of interest include an invitation from Roy Disney to attend the opening of Walt Disney World (1971); an advice request from an editor at Screw magazine (1971); and letters from Ray Bradbury offering poems on space exploration for publication (1970). The poems are no longer present and may have been moved to his Bio File in RG 2.</p>

					<head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
					<p>The majority of this material is from <title render="italic">Life</title> Managing Editor (ME) Jim Gaines, who began in this role in 1989 after serving as <title render="italic">People</title> ME. Other MEs represented in the materials are Judy Daniels and Richard Stolley, who succeeded Philip Kunhardt briefly before Daniels. A container list accompanied the files stating that the materials were sent to the archives by <title render="italic">Life</title> Chief of Research June Goldberg, but not that they are her files.</p>
					<p>Several files refer to <title render="italic">Life Weekly</title>, which is a new iteration of <title render="italic">Life</title> intended to be different from both the original and the revived monthly. The 1990 presentation from Gaines describes it.</p>
					<p>Some folders have <title render="italic">People</title> magazine materials, possibly carried over by Gaines.</p>

					<head>Biographical Note</head>
					<p>Alfred Eisenstaedt was born in Dirschau, West Prussia (present day Tczew, Poland) in 1898 and became interested in photography in his early teens. His interest in photography was interrupted for a time when he was drafted into the German army as an artilleryman. He was injured during his service and sent home for rehabilitation.</p>
					<p>After the war, Eisenstaedt moved to Berlin to work as a salesman and used his free time to study and experiment with photography. In 1927, his photograph of a girl playing tennis was bought by <title render="italic">Der Welt Spiegel</title>, an illustrated weekly, and published as a back-of-the-book feature.</p>
					<p>Eisenstaedt kept photography became a full-time photographer in 1929. His first position was as a special photo reporter for Pacific and Atlantic Photos. In 1931, Pacific and Atlantic Photos was taken over by the Associated Press, and Eisenstaedt remained emploted with the Associated Press.</p>
					<p>In 1935, Eisenstaedt moved to the United States and took a position with <title render="italic">Life</title> by 1936.

In addition to these subjects, Eisenstaedt also photographed America rebuilding after the depression, Japan during the war and post-war era, and the people and rulers of nations throughout the continent of Africa. His best known photograph may be of the Time Square kiss on V-Day. Eisenstaedt received <title render="italic">Life</title> masthead photographer designation in 1972.</p>
					<p>Along with having his photographs featured in <title render="italic">Life</title>, Eisenstaedt has also published a number of books including <title render="italic">Witness to Our Time</title>, <title render="italic">The Eye of Eisenstaedt</title>, <title render="italic">Martha's Vineyard</title>, <title render="italic">Witness to Nature</title>, <title render="italic">Wimbledon: A Celebration</title>, <title render="italic">People</title>, <title render="italic">Eisenstaedt's Guide to Photography</title>, <title render="italic">Eisenstaedt's Album</title>, and <title render="italic">Eisenstaedt: Germany</title>.</p>

Along with his awards, Eisenstaedt was voted as one of the world's greatest photographers in a 1968 poll conducted by Popular Photography and was presented with the #1,000,001 Leica Camera by E. Leitz Inc. in 1961.</p>

					<head>Biographical / Historical</head>
					<p>According to the Time Inc. archivist, <title render="italic">Life</title> began publishing more books showcasing the photograph collection around the time the monthly magazine closed in 2000.  Robert Sullivan was named a senior editor at <title render="italic">Life</title> in 1994 and later became the assistant managing editor of the monthly <title render="italic">Life</title>. A 2004 staff memo in his bio file (MS 3009-RG 2) states that Sullivan was running the editorial side of books published under the <title render="italic">Life</title> imprint. </p>
