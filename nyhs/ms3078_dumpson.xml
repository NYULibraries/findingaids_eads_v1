    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Nicknamed "Little Dynamo" for the boundless enthusiasm contained by his diminutive frame, <emph render="bold">James Russell Dumpson</emph> (1909–2012) was, among his many roles, the first African American welfare commissioner in American history. Born in Philadelphia on 5 April 1909, Dumpson was the oldest of the five children of James T. Dumpson (1884–1934), a bank messenger, and Edythe (Smith) Dumpson (1892–1944), who taught public school before her marriage.</p><p>After high school, Dumpson attended State Teachers College at Cheyney, Pennsylvania (1930–1932), the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Work (1937–1938), and Fordham University School of Social Service (1942–1944). He obtained bachelor's (1947) and master's (1950) degrees from the New School for Social Research before completing a Ph.D. at the University of Dacca, East Pakistan (1955). Dumpson was already working in Pakistan (1953–1954), where he had been appointed United Nations Advisor and Chief of Training in Social Welfare to the country's then newly-formed government.</p><p>Back in New York City he served as Director, Bureau of Child Welfare, in the Department of Welfare (1955–1958), and then as First Deputy Commissioner of Welfare (1958–1959). When Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. appointed Dumpson the City's Commissioner of Welfare (1959–1965), he became the first African American to hold such a position in the United States. He was also the first trained social worker to oversee welfare in New York, and, as such, took exception to a
<emph render="italic">Daily News</emph> editorial which attributed the City's welfare woes to ladies having "babies by assorted gentlemen so as to keep the relief checks growing fatter each year." Dumpson responded that the "only test for public assistance was a citizen's needs, not morals. With only a few exceptions . . . people on welfare, particularly children, desperately need the support." In 1964, after Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona had similarly disparaged welfare recipients, Dumpson referred to the soon-to-be Republican nominee for president as "the wealthy cowboy," dismissing his remarks as having "no place in the kind of war on poverty I am advocating."</p><p>Leaving the municipal sphere, Dumpson was briefly (1965–1967) professor and associate dean of the Hunter College School of Social Work before assuming deanship of Fordham University's Graduate School of Social Service (1967–1974). In his honor, the school would name the "James R. Dumpson Chair in Child Welfare Services" in 1980.</p><p>Mayor Abraham Beame lured Dumpson back to public service, appointing him Administrator of the New York City Human Resources Administration and Commissioner of the Department of Social Services (1974–1976).</p><p>At a time when less driven humans might have retired, Dumpson actively consulted or sat on—and often chaired—a dizzying number of charitable and philanthropic boards. In his 80s he was tapped by Mayor David Dinkins to oversee the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. </p><p>James R. Dumpson died in New York City on 5 November 2012, aged 103, survived by his widow, Goldie (Brangman) Dumpson, the former director of a nurse anesthesia program New York, and his daughter, the psychotherapist Jeree Wade.</p><p>[The most detailed chronology of Dumpson's life and work appears in Alma J. Carten, <extref actuate="onRequest" href="http://bobcat.library.nyu.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=nyu_aleph004159930&amp;context=L&amp;vid=NYHS&amp;search_scope=nyhs&amp;tab=nyhs&amp;lang=en_US">Reflections on the American Social Welfare State: The Collected Papers of James R.

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The James R. Dumpson Papers span Dr. Dumpson's long and busy working life—he remained active into his tenth decade—in the field of social welfare both at home and abroad. The collection includes a dizzying number of speeches, conference papers, and articles, not to mention the contributions Dumpson made to various publications. (See Series I and Series VIII.)<lb/>
<lb/>
Dumpson's correspondence, while spread throughout the collection, is spotty, and grouped largely in nine folders covering the years 1930–2008. Of interest are the letters he received as New York City's Commissioner of Welfare, when social workers of his department staged a month-long strike for better pay and more manageable caseloads in January 1965. (See Series II.)<lb/>
<lb/>
The collection includes a large amount of "memorabilia" (Dumpson's designation) that was originally stored in binders and in scrapbooks, a mixture of ephemera, correspondence, newspaper clippings, photographs, and publications documenting Dumpson's educational, professional, and private life. (See Series III.)<lb/>
<lb/>
Personal material is limited to a few financial papers and receipts, citations, and a folder of photographs of Dumpson, either solo portraits, or posed with New York City officials and visiting dignitaries, at casual functions and award ceremonies. (See Series IV.)<lb/>
<lb/>
From his tenure as dean of Fordham University's Graduate School of Social Service, the collection holds a mix of correspondence, administrative memos, accreditation reports, and information on the naming of a chair in his honor in 1980—the James R. Dumpson Chair in Child Welfare Services. (See Series V.)<lb/>
<lb/>
Dumpson's international social welfare activities are documented by material from his time during the 1950s as United Nations Advisor and Chief of Training in Social Welfare to the then newly-formed Government of Pakistan, and his work during the 1960s and 1970s for the United States Senate Sub-Committee on Refugees and Escapees in South Vietnam. (See Series VI.)<lb/>
<lb/>
The collection contains a number of single-topic files—such as those covering Dumpson's time as administrator of the New York City Human Resources Administration—and a significant amount of loose and unlabeled material that defies precise categorization, but relates broadly to the perennial issues of social welfare. (See Series VII.)<lb/>
<lb/>
Dumpson assembled a range of printed publications—books, pamphlets, periodicals, government documents, and conference proceedings—many of which include chapters or prefatory contributions by him. While most publications in the collection center on social welfare generally, some focus on specific issues like aging, or black children in foster care. And some, such as a 1922 monograph on Renaissance art and poetry, seem to date from Dumpson's school days. (See Series VIII.)<lb/>
<lb/>
Lastly, a small amount of phonograph and VHS recordings capture Dumpson's appearances on New York City-based radio and television broadcasts discussing, among other topics, juvenile delinquency, the AIDS crisis, and homelessness. (See Series IX.)<lb/>

That Series II spans seventy-eight years (1930–2008) in just nine folders gives some idea of the spottiness of the correspondence.  Of historical interest are the letters Dumpson received in January 1965 during his tenure as New York City's Commissioner of Welfare, when social workers of his department staged a month-long strike for better pay and more manageable caseloads (see box 3, folder 15).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_82da32d9d9c3cdde646c0b2302cd2b24"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Series II is sorted chronologically.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_a267c80a5d1e6e79fa472a7aff84090e" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1930-1935</unitdate><container id="aspace_9e82eb95a2052fcc0a0867bb202886bc" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7963]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_9e82eb95a2052fcc0a0867bb202886bc" type="Folder">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_b7370ce6ed227089d0469dca07259101" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1940</unitdate><container id="aspace_54b7d6a50801869dbf8a51d16b88a5e4" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7963]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_54b7d6a50801869dbf8a51d16b88a5e4" type="Folder">11</container></did></c><c id="aspace_df5d203d71b4433b896283a67ed2139a" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1951-1959</unitdate><container id="aspace_f5f38399452deafe71c76e1178118983" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7963]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_f5f38399452deafe71c76e1178118983" type="Folder">12</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_b7bb3d52724c3cd66a591a1c1e9f2203"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>See also box 8, folder 6, for personal letters from Pakistan dated 1953.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_839a4e94441951e5718cd62e529e9653" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1960-1965</unitdate><container id="aspace_fd00d04e2987b52b83b8a939d36839ce" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7963]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_fd00d04e2987b52b83b8a939d36839ce" type="Folder">13</container></did></c><c id="aspace_9256ddde1c6e0388b6ac4a67be48dddd" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence (letters re: Beame's appointment of Dumpson as HRD Administrator)</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1961-1985 (bulk, 1974)</unitdate><container id="aspace_f264a17522239a604a5d0acf9074912c" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7963]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_f264a17522239a604a5d0acf9074912c" type="Folder">14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f90d87ecf576bbe003f6c3f8115141f7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence (letters re: Welfare Strike)</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1965</unitdate><container id="aspace_00d620209bb5231ee47f87623ac2f492" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7963]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_00d620209bb5231ee47f87623ac2f492" type="Folder">15</container></did></c><c id="aspace_a6487643a7f63da8b2b3835a7cd4eda7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1966-1979</unitdate><container id="aspace_4f95aca5bb081c58c1aad7dc91808659" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7963]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_4f95aca5bb081c58c1aad7dc91808659" type="Folder">16</container></did></c><c id="aspace_f27cda736938b71eec2d336ea8eabd02" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1980-1989</unitdate><container id="aspace_fc73e460285e5d445e8915a9dad177ac" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7963]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_fc73e460285e5d445e8915a9dad177ac" type="Folder">17</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ce6bf364051c785499e47fcc0531cf01" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1992-2008</unitdate><container id="aspace_b26adc27c99fe3315cbbfb3316c65425" label="Mixed Materials [1 0170 00000 7963]" type="Offsite-Box">3</container><container parent="aspace_b26adc27c99fe3315cbbfb3316c65425" type="Folder">18</container></did></c></c><c id="aspace_8553cd0c71e73274fbcaae278be6c1a4" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series III.

Two additional binders were simply marked "Memorabilia" without numerical designations. There is little difference between this "memorabilia" (now rehoused in folders) and the material found in the collection's scrapbooks, which contain a mixture of ephemera, correspondence, newspaper clippings, photographs, and publications documenting Dumpson's educational, professional, and personal life.

Dumpson over the course of his long life. Many bear his initials or signature inside the front cover or on the flyleaf. While most publications concern social welfare broadly, some focus on particular issues, such as aging, or black children in foster care. Some items—like a 1922 monograph on Renaissance art and poetry (box 20, volume 10)—appear to date from Dumpson's school years. Publications including chapters or contributions by Dumpson have been noted when obvious.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_70a4283c0cc2f5db24f45355bb1309b6"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Series VIII is organized in five sub-series:<lb/>
