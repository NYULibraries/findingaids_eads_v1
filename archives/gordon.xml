            <head>Scope and Content</head>
            <p>The Arthur Gordon Papers contain manuscripts of short stories written by Gordon, correspondence related to those stories, one nonfiction magazine article manuscript, and several journal entries on the art of writing. The first folder of Subseries A contains materials related to the provenance of the collection, and was not originally bound with the rest of the collection. All other materials were originally bound in three volumes by Gordon.</p>
            <p>The short story manuscripts, along with correspondence between Gordon and his agent (Edith Sewell) on the sale of the manuscripts to magazines, comprise the bulk of the collection. Gordon wrote explicitly for the popular market, dabbling in genres such as romance and mystery in simple, accessible prose. Nearly all of the stories deal with life aboard ship. Exceptions to this rule include "Dude Jungle," set in the Amazon jungle; and "Sister Act" and "All the Angles," set in New York City show business. The latter two stories are also unusual among Gordon's work for having female narrators.</p>
            <p>The article titled "Troop Ships are Never Dull" is unique among the manuscripts in the collection for being a nonfiction magazine article. It describes Gordon's experiences as an officer on the U.S.S. 
                <emph render="italic">General A.E. Anderson</emph>, which transported American troops to and from Europe during World War II. The article was published in 
                <emph render="italic">The Infantry Journal</emph> in 1949.</p>
            <p>Most frequently the backdrop of Gordon's fiction is a U.S. Navy vessel, but a few stories are set on passenger ships as well: see "Love At First Carry" and "On the High Seas, Murder." Many of the stories are light and humorous in tone. Plots tend to be driven by romantic hijinks rather than the grimmer aspects of military service, as in "Sea Sleds Scuttled, Inc." and "Dames Love the U.S.N." Yet Gordon could take a serious turn too, particularly in those stories he set in World War II: "Men for the Job," "Old Gold, New Gold," and "Life of the Party," among others.</p>
            <p>The term "journal entries" was created by the archivist to describe short nonfiction manuscripts that are essentially ruminations on the writer's craft. These typed or handwritten manuscripts were written sporadically by Gordon and not connected to any specific short story. Where the journal entries were given titles by Gordon, they have been retained in the folder titles.</p>
            <p>Though Gordon lived until 1975, the last manuscripts in the collection date from 1957.</p>

            <head>Biography of Arthur Gordon</head>
            <p>Arthur Gordon was born on January 24, 1899, in Fall River, Massachusetts, "one of that generation which had the last world war sandwiched between high school and college," as he wrote in 1940. He served in the U.S. Naval Reserve as a commissioned officer during World War I. After two years at St. Stephen’s (now Bard) College, Gordon returned to the sea. He joined the U.S. Coast Survey and then the Merchant Marine, sailing the world for nearly two decades. In 1938 he took a room at the Brooklyn YMCA and began to write full-time. "When I’m at sea my one absorbing interest is in writing. When I’m writing my one absorbing topic is the sea," Gordon wrote. Nearly all of his stories had the sea as a backdrop. He took the pen name Gordon Ramsey to distinguish himself from the editor Arthur Gordon (of 
                <emph render="italic">Good Housekeeping</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Cosmopolitan</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">Guidepost</emph> magazines). Though he sold stories to popular magazines fairly regularly in the early 1940s, his writing career was interrupted in 1942 by a return to active duty in World War II. He served as a navigating officer on the U.S.S. 
                <emph render="italic">General A.E. Anderson</emph> until late in 1945. From December 1942 until January 1946, Gordon was unable to find time to write a word, though he carried around a briefcase containing an unfinished manuscript for a year in hopes of completing it. He returned to writing full-time, publishing stories in 
                <emph render="italic">Country Gentleman</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Liberty</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Colliers</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">Argosy</emph> magazines, among others. He attended a professional clinic for writers at NYU on the GI Bill, and taught writing skills at NYU in 1950. He died in Staten Island in September of 1975.</p>
