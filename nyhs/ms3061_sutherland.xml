    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Josiah Sutherland Jr., one of the five children of Josiah and Abigail (Dunkin) Sutherland, was born near Stissing, in the town of Stanford, Dutchess County, New York, on 12 June 1804. He attended the district school, and graduated in 1824 from Union College in Schenectady, New York. In addition to his studies at Litchfield (Connecticut) Law School in 1825, Sutherland read law at the office of Samuel G. Huntington of Waterford, New York, and then at the office of Bushnell &amp; Stebbins of Hudson, New York. He was admitted to the bar in 1828 or 1829 (sources vary) and began practice in Livingston, New York, in partnership with Robert H. Morris (1808–1855), who would become the 64th Mayor of New York City (serving 1841–1844).</p><p>Sutherland was appointed District Attorney for Columbia County, New York, in 1832, and held that office until 1843. In 1838 he moved to Hudson, the county seat, where he continued to practice law. He was elected as a Democrat to the 32nd United States Congress, serving from 4 March 1851 to 3 March 1853.</p><p>In 1857 Sutherland moved to New York City where he continued to practice law. He served as a justice of the New York Supreme Court (1st District) from 1858 to 1871, was ex officio judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1862 and 1870, and judge of the New York City Court of General Sessions from 1872 to 1878, when he retired from the bench.</p><p>Josiah Sutherland died on 25 May 1887 and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery, in the Bronx, in a family plot that also holds the remains of his wife, Jane (McLellan) Sutherland (1811–1876), and the couple's five children.</p>  </bioghist>
