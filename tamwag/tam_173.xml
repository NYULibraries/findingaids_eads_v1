            <p>Materials were donated by the Metropolitan Council on Housing in 1995, 2002, and 2008. Preliminary inventories were drafted in 2002 and 2008, which served as the basis for an online guide published in 2009. Sometime before 2007, some audio materials were separated from the collection. In 2013, the separated audio materials were returned to the collection, rehoused, and described. Four unrelated cassettes, including dubbed versions of commercial music recordings, were deaccessioned. In 2014, the archived websites were added as Series VI. In 2015, boxes 47 through 61 were removed and incorporated with the Cooper Square Committee Records (TAM.356) collection as its boxes 1 through 15.</p>

            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

                    <p>The Metropolitan Council on Housing, founded in 1959, is a membership organization dedicated to preserving and expanding New York City’s supply of affordable housing. Met Council focuses on preserving rental housing and strengthening tenants’ rights. They work through grassroots organizing, lobbying, direct action, including rent strikes, and public education. Met Council has a monthly newspaper (TENANT), a weekly call-in radio show (“Housing Notebook”), forums, and a volunteer-staffed tenant hotline.</p>
