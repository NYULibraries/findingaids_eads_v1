    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Sister Spit was an all woman, spoken word and performance series in San Francisco, founded by Sini Anderson and Michelle Tea. It ran weekly from 1994-2006, in opposition to the male dominated slam-poetry scene. Members included Lynn Breedlove, Tara Jepsen, Eileen Myles, Anna-Joy Springer, and Sash Sunday. Sister Spit went on tour as the Ramblin' Road Show in 1997 with tours through 2001. In 2007, the tour was revived as Sister Spit: The Next Generation annual tour. In 2022, the tour changed its name to Resplendent to be more inclusive of all genders.</p>  </bioghist>
