            <p>The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) is an activist organization addressing a variety of issues including world disarmament, full rights for women, racial and economic justice, and ending all forms of violence. Founded in 1915 by some 1,300 women from Europe and North America, WILPF is organized in 37 countries and lobbies governments at the international, national and local levels. The New York Metropolitan Branch of WILPF was established in 1920.</p>
