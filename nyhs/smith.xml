    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>James Reuel Smith was born in 1852 in Skaneateles, New York. After the early death of his mother, his father having remarried, Smith went to live in the household of a cousin. In 1882 Smith married Elizabeth Thompson; they had no children. Family money enabled Smith to actively pursue his hobby of photographing and investigating springs and wells. This interest led him to travel around Europe, looking for springs and wells mentioned in literature. In 1922, he published <title render="italic">Springs and Wells in Greek and Roman Literature, Their Legends and Locations.</title></p><p>Smith's interest was also local: He spent much of the years 1897 to 1901 bicycling around northern Manhattan and the Bronx looking for and photographing springs and wells. Smith's enthusiasm for springs and wells was well-matched with his photographic eye and his meticulous note-taking on the locations and conditions of the springs and wells he saw. James Reuel Smith died in 1935. In his will he left a bequest to the New-York Historical Society to publish his manuscript notes and photographs of springs and wells of northern Manhattan and the Bronx. Librarian Dorothy Barck worked with Smith's research papers and notes, and edited his manuscript material, leading to N-YHS's publication of <title render="italic">Springs and Wells of Manhattan and the Bronx, New York City, at the End of the Nineteenth Century,</title> in 1938. In the introduction to the volume, Smith wrote: "A city spring frequently possesses all the beautiful surroundings of a rural one, and besides exciting that pathetic interest aroused by something pleasureable which will shortly cease to exist, it is, for the meditative, a link which connects the thoughts with the past." </p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The collection holds the original photographic prints and glass plate negatives; manuscript drafts; indexes, classifications, and other descriptions; and research files and notes underlying James Reuel Smith's <title render="italic">Springs and Wells of Manhattan and the Bronx, New York City, at the End of the Nineteenth Century</title>. </p><p>The photographs date from 1897-1901 and are primarily of springs and wells in Northern Manhattan and the Bronx. There are about 350 prints, organized into 10 boxes. In addition, 260 glass negatives (247 4x5s; 13 5x7s) and 38 acetate negatives are housed in 7 boxes. Though Smith did take photographs of pumps and cisterns, the natural springs he found during his travels seemed to pique his interest the most, and these views are what make up most of the photos. </p><p>Manuscript material in the collection relates to both New York springs and wells and to Smith's research for his book on springs and wells in Greek and Roman literature. This material extends into the 1930s, reflecting Smith's research and writing subsequent to his photographing, and to some uncertain degree, N-YHS's interventions during the editing and publication process.</p>  </scopecontent>

<p>The Geographic File (PR 020) contains photographs of Central Park, as well as many of the Manhattan, Brooklyn and Bronx streets that Smith photographed. The George E. Stonebridge Photograph Collection (PR 066) has photographs of Fordham and Tremont, as well as some Bronx parks, from the same time period. The Eugene L. Armbruster Collection (PR 081) includes images of rural Brooklyn by amateur photographer Eugene L. Armbruster; though the majority of the collection dates from the 1910s and 1920s, Armbruster began taking photographs in the late 19th century.</p>  </relatedmaterial>

<p>The photographs in the collection and some manuscript material was processed in the early 2000s by Miranda Schwartz. Either at that time or earlier, much of the manuscript and research material in the original collection was separated and not included in the processing and collection description. This additional material, which now comprises much of subseries IV.A, was returned to the collection and processed by Larry Weimer in December 2021.</p>  </processinfo>

Utilizing a complex coding system of his own devising, this document provides information on exact locations and cameras used, as well as a key to the numbering, classification, and identification of the prints. Researchers interested in the Springs and Wells Collection would benefit from studying, decoding, and mastering this index thoroughly. </p><p>The subseries also includes two hand-bound manuscripts: "Wells, Pumps, Cisterns" and "Springs, for revision." "Wells, Pumps, Cisterns" is a handwritten manuscript; it is subtitled Queens, Hoboken Spg, Minnesota Giant Spg, Bath, Eng., Spg, Venice Wells. "Springs" is mimeographed but has extensive handwritten notes by the author. It discusses New York City springs, which Smith investigated thoroughly, but its text does not seem to exactly overlap with the author's introduction to Springs and Wells. Perhaps it is a longer text from which the author adapted his shorter introduction.</p><p>The subseries also holds Smith's files of research notes, clippings, tearsheets, indexes, and other documents used for both Manhattan &amp; Bronx springs and wells and for his work on springs and wells in Greek and Roman literature. Original artifacts in the subseries include a set of four framed maps with push pins identifying locations and descriptive notes, and two of the original wood boxes that Smith used to hold his files.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_154fe8ed6f9f2d28a24ef53e9ca4ba83"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is roughly arranged by format, with manuscript material and indexes first, followed by the research files and rough notes. The notes remain in the number coded order that Smith maintained. Unfortunately, much of the numbering is attached to newspaper cuttings and other acidic material that Smith used as wraps, and so they are fragile and crumbling.</p></arrangement><processinfo id="aspace_fbadb1eccf0d8cbe51535a85db533ce0"><head>Processing Information</head><p>The research files and other material in boxes 18-23 was separated from the rest of the collection at some point, but not cataloged or otherwise processed. In December 2021, this material was returned to the collection and the finding aid revised to account for it by archivist Larry Weimer.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_ref41_975" level="file"><did><unittitle>Springs and Wells-Analysis of Photograph Subjects by James Reuel Smith</unittitle><unitdate>1897-1901</unitdate><container id="aspace_e57deab6f0d615142a55a6568bfc0ea5" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013269]" type="Offsite-Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_e57deab6f0d615142a55a6568bfc0ea5" type="Folder">22</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref42_m25" level="file"><did><unittitle>Manuscripts: "Wells, Pumps, Cisterns"; "Springs, for revision"</unittitle><unitdate>1897-1901</unitdate><container id="aspace_6fd79a9b921716602c0f14909088262e" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013269]" type="Offsite-Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_6fd79a9b921716602c0f14909088262e" type="Folder">23</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref43_16p" level="file"><did><unittitle>Handwritten Notes</unittitle><unitdate>1897-1901</unitdate><container id="aspace_320e09c7a044e54044180ba73107ed50" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013269]" type="Offsite-Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_320e09c7a044e54044180ba73107ed50" type="Folder">24</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref44_91n" level="file"><did><unittitle>Handwritten Draft</unittitle><unitdate>1897-1901</unitdate><container id="aspace_44555ea8523d248e675c99b1dbd159e3" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013269]" type="Offsite-Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_44555ea8523d248e675c99b1dbd159e3" type="Folder">25</container></did></c><c id="aspace_05205cabae1a24250e22217db0678a97" level="file"><did><unittitle>Drafts, notes, indexes, classifications  (14 folders)</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">circa 1890s-1930s</unitdate><container id="aspace_c282f792a487b5c2bb631fd6c8968cab" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013272]" type="Offsite-Box">18</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9a228b3259211da4dab57f95264c8b51"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Also holds a folder of notes by N-YHS assistant librarian Hugh Flick describing the collection content as received at N-YHS, and the collection title rubber stamp.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_404f807713474ac60797ba7b54dac48d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Notes, clippings, tearsheets (16 folders)</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">circa 1890s-1930s</unitdate><container id="aspace_2af0e1750e8215d16f91c33317d23dd7" label="Mixed Materials [1804000013273]" type="Offsite-Box">19</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_0a0afe30c52617bf6b2532abc669c014"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Also holds one folder of letters to Smith answering his inquiries for information.
