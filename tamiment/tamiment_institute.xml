            <p>The Tamiment Institute was founded in 1935 as the educational arm of the People’s Educational Camp Society (PECS), which owned and operated Camp Tamiment, originally a resort for socialists. The Institute organized lectures, an annual conference (1930s-40s) that focused on labor, industrial relations and related issues, seminars, an annual essay contest for college students, an annual book award, and concerts. These activities took place at the Camp and in New York City. The seminars, jointly sponsored with Daedalus, the journal of the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences, featured prominent liberal and social-democratic intellectuals of the day. Topics included mass culture, on the metropolis, and on youth, Upon the 1956 closure and absorption of the Rand School of Social Science by PECS, the Institute undertook the reorganization of the Rand School’s Meyer London Memorial Library, reopened in 1957 as the Tamiment Insitute Library, which it then donated it to New York University in 1963. In 1960 the Institute established the quarterly periodical
