      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The collection consists of material apparently from a disassembled photo album on Austrian
        Spanish Civil War volunteers. The album, possibly constructed from two or three smaller
        albums, was presented by Hans Grolheim to U.S. volunteer Edward Lending in 1986 on the
        occasion of the 50th anniversary of the War. Contents are 2 sets of black and white photos,
        mounted on cards; one set of 24 images is numbered and accompanied by two copies of a
        booklet with detailed captions. Three small color prints may be of the original covers of
        the albums. The other is a similar-sized set of unnumbered photos, with similar scenes of
        groups of volunteers at the front and some images showing Austrian and other veterans
        retreating from Spain, in camps in France, and in later years. Also included is are
        photocopies of some of the original photo album pages and a photocopy of statements on the
        War and the role of Austrian volunteers by General Julius Deutsch and Major Anton
        Dobritzhofer, with a signed presentation note to Edward Lending from Hans Grolheim.</p>
