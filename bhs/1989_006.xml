    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The first record of organized firefighting in Brooklyn dates from 1772, when six local men were recruited to combat fires near "the Ferry," a settlement having risen around the ferry landing at the foot of present day Fulton Street. A company of volunteers, consisting of seven men chosen at the town meeting, was formed in 1785.   Beginning in 1788, those Brooklyn firemen who had performed the prescribed length of service were exempted from jury duty and militia service, which swelled the ranks of the volunteers. Upon the incorporation of the Village of Brooklyn in 1816, the Village Trustees were given "full authority to make their Fire Department what in their judgement it should be." The Trustees quickly established two new companies, increasing the total roll to ninety five men. The Trustees also established the offices of four fire wardens, elected for the first time in 1817.</p><p>The three volunteer companies of what became known as the Western District, were represented by a Chief Engineer, who was nominated and directly elected by the firemen until 1827, when the election was delegated to the foremen of the respective companies.  The selection process returned to the firemen themselves in 1839 with the re-institution of direct elections, which process usually reflected local, regional, and national politics as well as ethno-cultural affinities and social rank. The Chief Engineer reported to the Trustees of the Village of Brooklyn and, after the incorporation of the City of Brooklyn in 1834, to the Common Council of Brooklyn. The institution of the "Annual Report of the Chief Engineer to the Mayor and Common Council" was inaugurated in 1828.</p><p>The Village of Williamsburgh organized a firefighting force and purchased two engines for two companies, "Washington" and "Protection Engine" in 1834.  In 1844, a third company was added, "Good Interest."  The Williamsburgh Fire Department included seventeen companies by 1854, at which time the City of Williamsburgh (chartered 1851) consolidated with the city of Brooklyn. Upon consolidation, the Williamsburgh Fire Department's name was changed to the Fire Department of the Eastern District.  </p><p>By the mid-nineteenth century, the administrative portion of the Brooklyn Fire Department had grown to include: a Board of Representatives, made up of a fireman from each company; a Board of Trustees, which supervised the allocation and disposal of funds generated by dues and other benefits; various standing committees; a Board of Fire Commissioners; a Board of Officers composed of the Chief Engineer, Assistant Engineers, and the Foreman of each company; the Board of Fire Wardens; and, the Exempt Firemen's Association. Each fire company "chose its own members, generally from among near neighbors, friends, and relatives, and thus directly reflected the social composition of the several wards."  Close proximity between the firehouse and residence was necessary to ensure maximum efficiency and prompt response.</p><p>Living and working together in often dangerous conditions bound the men into a brotherhood, and made each man the judge of his mates' strength, willingness, and agility. These were qualities needed to pull an engine through uneven, garbage-strewn streets, to dodge a crumbling fiery wall, or to assert and defend the company's honor against a variety of challenges. </p><p>The firehouses functioned as neighborhood clubhouses of sorts, attracted hangers-on who ran with the official volunteers, and provided a meeting place for the members of the firefighting fraternity. Records indicate that membership in a volunteer company became an important component of social identity.</p><p>
Competition between individual companies was strong and frequently resulted in violence both at the scene of a fire and en route. Companies often competed to be first at a blaze and tried to eclipse each other's apparatus in pumping power. Great physical endurance was required to pull the engines through cobblestoned and unpaved streets in all weather and to pump water from the East River prior to the formation of the Nassau Water Company, which began pumping Ridgewood (Long Island) Reservoir water into Brooklyn in 1858.</p><p>
The fraternal aspects of the brotherhood of volunteer firemen extended beyond the local company. Volunteer firemen administered relief in the form of sick benefits, pensions, and widows' and orphans' stipends, and mortgages and loans became available through the Firemen's Fund. Capital was generated by fundraising activities such as balls and musical entertainments, as well as through the collection of dues and fines.</p><p>As the population of Brooklyn grew rapidly during the 1840s and 1850s, as a result of both in-migration and large waves of Irish and German immigrants, the size and density of the growing city began to show the inadequacies of a volunteer force of autonomous companies that were unable to fight fires effectively. Fire Department officials petitioned the Mayor and Common Council for funds to establish new firehouses as well as to maintain and purchase equipment and supplies. The "Annual Report of the Chief Engineer, Western District" for 1863 indicated the contemporary size of the Fire Department:</p><p>"The working force of the Department, at the present time consists of eight Engineers, eleven hundred and twenty two members of Engine Companies, four hundred and ten Hose Companies.  And one hundred and ninety five members of Hook and Ladder Companies, making a total of seventeen hundred and twenty seven men. The Department is divided into fourteen hand engines, fifteen hose carriages, and five hook and ladder trucks, all of which are doing duty."</p><p>The volunteer status of firemen was sharply challenged in the mid-nineteenth century as firefighting effectiveness diminished in the rapidly urbanizing city. The first bill to establish a paid Fire Department in Brooklyn was introduced and defeated in 1858, but the capability of the volunteer Fire Department was further contested as Brooklyn became an industrial center during the Civil War. The City of Brooklyn replaced cisterns with hydrants that dispensed a steady and predictable water supply, while technological advances in the form of horse drawn steam pumping engines threatened volunteer companies that pulled their pumpers through the streets by hand, sometimes to the risk of life and limb to themselves and passersby. The fire brigades' autonomy, but not their identity, was summarily altered by "An Act to Create a Metropolitan Fire District" which in 1865, merged the Fire Departments of the City of New York and the Eastern and Western Districts of the City of Brooklyn under the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Fire Commissioners appointed by the governor. </p><p>The companies remained volunteer in nature, but the consolidation produced renewed demands for a paid firefighting force for the city. "An Act to Reorganize the Fire Department of the City of Brooklyn" received approval in 1869, which moved governance of the fire department from New York State to New York City elected and appointed officials.  The Mayor, the Comptroller, and the Street Commissioner acquired authority over the four Commissioners of the Fire Department.  The Trustees of the Widows and Orphans Fund of the Fire Department reported to the Common Council of the City of Brooklyn, while annual appropriations for Fire Department expenses were relegated to the King's County Board of Supervisors. The bill also suggested that the new Fire Commissioners select members of the paid department from among exempt firemen, who had served a full term in the Volunteer Department. </p><p>The cities of Brooklyn and Williamsburg converted from volunteer brigades to a paid fire department by 1870.  Thereafter the transition from a volunteer to a paid firefighting force took place upon the annexation of individual towns into the city of Brooklyn as follow: New Lots, 1886; Flatbush, 1894; Gravesend, 1894; New Utrecht, 1894; and Flatlands, 1896. Brooklyn became a borough of New York City in January 1898.</p><p>After the transition from a volunteer to a salaried Fire Department in Brooklyn and the annexed towns, Veteran Volunteer Associations served as surrogates for the vanished volunteer firehouses and maintained their traditional identities and affinities. In addition, ex-volunteers were eligible for membership in state and national firefighting organizations that accepted both professional firefighters and volunteers. The "vamps" of the old department perpetuated the fraternal aspects of the volunteer firehouses through these associations and organizations, maintaining the disbursements of benefits and pensions virtually as long as there were eligible veterans or their beneficiaries to receive such. </p><p>Sources:</p><p>Belknap, Rufus R.  <title render="italic">The Fireman's Almanac and Reference Book for the Year 1860, containing in addition to the calendar a memorandum.</title>  New York: H.

<p>Upon acquisition by BHS, the collection was divided into four parts: Ledgers, manuscripts, etc., were assigned to the Archives (1989.006), photographs to the BHS Image Collection (V1989.027), objects and works on paper to the Museum (M1989.044), and periodicals (<emph render="italic">The Fireman's Herald</emph> and <emph render="italic">The Firemen's Journal</emph>) to the Library.</p><p>A history and description of the collection was authored by Rose Garvin-Jackson in 1990. In 1991, the collection was inventoried by Nancy Cricco with a grant funded by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC). The inventory was revised and a finding aid was authored by Theresa Mora and Dr. Marilyn H. Pettit in 2000. The finding aid was further revised by Leilani Dawson in 2006. The finding aid was once again revised and partially entered into Archivists' Toolkit by Patricia Glowinski in September 2011. It was at this point that the collection's photographs were formally reintegrated in the collection. </p><p>In 2010, twenty two boxes of ledgers that had not been included in the existing finding aid were inventoried. These boxes remained in storage until 2016, when twenty of the boxes were shipped back to BHS. The inventory was reconciled by Ryan Frick, who integrated these ledgers into the existing finding aid inventory, and then entered the revised content into Archivists' Toolkit. At the same time, artifacts and works on paper that had been separated at the time of acquisition were intellectually reintegrated into the collection, and the collection's finding aid and organization was again revised by John Zarrillo. Yingwen Huang added additional ledgers to collection (boxes 226-228) in April 2017. These ledgers were found housed with the Kelly collection, although their provenance is unknown.</p>  </processinfo>

<p>The bulk of the collection was transferred to Brooklyn Historical Society (BHS) from the James A. Kelly Institute for Local Historical Studies of St. Francis College in Brooklyn in August 1989. Other portions of the Kelly Institute's collections were transferred to Brooklyn College Library Special Collections and to the Municipal Archives of the City of New York, and a portion of the present collection was already in the custody of BHS.</p><p>The collection was originally acquired through the efforts of James A. Kelly, Deputy County Clerk of King's County from 1944 to 1971, who removed a large volume of Brooklyn materials in 1956 from Brooklyn Borough Hall and the Brooklyn Municipal Building on Joralemon Street to St. Francis College when they were threatened with destruction. Included in the archives were municipal records of the City of Brooklyn from 1645 through 1898, as well as records of the six original towns of Kings County. Kelly was designated the first official historian of the borough of Brooklyn during this time. </p><p>The collection was first surveyed by Robert Sink (Brooklyn Rediscovery project) in the 1970s.</p>  </custodhist>
