    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The organization of the Communications Workers of America (CWA) in 1947 was the culmination of nearly a half-century of struggle for telephone unionism. Until the middle 1890s there was very little union activity among telephone workers. In 1898 the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) began to try to organize some of the telephone linemen and cable splicers. Numerous strikes by the IBEW in the 1910s were unsuccessful as the Bell Telephone Company used its monopolistic control over the industry to defeat telephone unionism. However, during these years there was an upsurge of union membership among telephone operators mostly centered in Boston. A joint organizing campaign by the IBEW and Women's Trade Union League was very successful and won major concessions in 1914-1915. However, after a failed strike in 1919, the Bell Company began to aggressively promote company unions and aggressively fought all organizing drives.</p><p>Telephone unions found that it was very difficult to organize an industry in which the Bell Company had monopolistic control and almost unlimited resources. The company took advantage of the fact that telephone workers were geographically dispersed and the conversion to dial telephones made the system less vulnerable to labor slowdowns. Bell's hiring practices assured that the vast majority of telephone workers were relatively highly educated, native born Caucasians who were well spoken in English. Telephone operators were predominately young women who tended to work for only a few years before marrying and having families. These workforce demographics made union organizing difficult.</p><p>The passage of the Wagner Act in 1936, which removed all the legal barriers to industrial union organization, reinvigorated the campaign for telephone unionism. However, progress was slow as telephone workers were for the most part insulated from the worst effects of the Great Depression. The Bell Company's response to the Wagner Act that outlawed company unions was to transform them into so-called independent labor organizations (non AFL or CIO) that could claim to be in compliance with national labor laws. During the early CIO years from 1937 through 1942 union organizing proceeded slowly in the telephone industry. The focus was on amalgamating the various local unions that were plant, craft, or district based into a national federation.</p><p>In 1939 the National Federation of Telephone Workers (NFTW) was formed but this organization was weak and decentralized. Stagnant wages and deteriorating working conditions during World War II stimulated telephone worker solidarity and union amalgamation. When Joseph A. Beirne was elected President of NFTW in 1943 the union began a full-scale organizing campaign. In 1946 there was a nation wide strike that led to the first national agreement with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T). However, recognizing the weakness of the NFTW structure AT&amp;T forced another strike in 1947. When this strike collapsed the NFTW structure fell apart and the CWA was born.</p><p>During the next twenty-five years the CWA under the leadership of Joseph A. Beirne moved aggressively to organize all the telephone workers in the United States. AT&amp;T with its monopolistic control resisted. It was, however, not until 1974 after years of labor-management unrest and a series of strikes that AT&amp;T agreed to system wide collective bargaining. Shortly after the national contract was signed Joseph A. Beirne died and was replaced as President by Secretary-Treasurer Glenn E. Watts.</p><p>In the 1980s the CWA began to expand beyond telecommunications creating a Public Employees Department that successfully organized 34,000 New Jersey state workers in 1981. In 1985 Morton Bahr became the CWA President. In 1987 the CWA merged with the International Typographical Workers Union. In 1992 it absorbed the National Association of Broadcast Employees and the Newspaper Guild merged with the CWA. Today the CWA is one of the United States' strongest unions with more than 600,000 members.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>Plaques given to Morton Bahr were discovered in the repository in 2014 and added to the collection as Box 358. Also in 2014, the archived websites were added as Series XIII. The 2016 accretion was added to the record as its own series in accordance with previous arrangement and description decisions. Materials in the accretion were placed in new acid-free folders and boxes and arranged in the order in which they were recieved. Oversized materials were removed and rehoused in oversized boxes and folders. An additional accretion of convention binders received in April 2016 were added to Series III: Conventions. Materials from this donation were removed from their original binders and placed in acid-free folders.</p><p>In August 2017, one item was retroactively accessioned into the collection.  This item was prepared to be moved to offsite art storage in September 2017.</p><p>In 2019-2022, archived websites were added to the finding aid. </p>  </processinfo>

Speed Matters is a project of the CWA to advocate for affordable, high speed internet for universal internet access for all Americans. The website contains the project's principles, benefits to expanded access to high speed internet, publications produced by the project, news, and other organizational partnerships. CWA Political is the website for the CWA Committee on Political Education – Political Contributions Committee. The website contains information on the CWA political action fund, polical activist training materials, listing of endorsed candidates, resources, and their newsletter, CWA Collective Briefing. </p><p>StoptheTPP is a project organized by the Communications Workers of America to raise public awareness of and organize opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership on the grounds that the massive trade deal would lead to deregulation that could have negative impacts for workers as well as consumers.  The site features fact sheets and educational resources that detail the effects of the TPP across different industries like commercial fishing and pharmaceuticals, news related to ongoing developments, and information about how to get involved in opposition to the deal.  As the United States was pulled out of the TPP in 2017, the site is no longer actively updated. T-Mobile Sprint Facts is a project organized by the Communication Workers of America to raise public awareness of and organize opposition to the merger between mobile service providers T-Mobile and Sprint on the grounds that the merger is not in the public interest, that it would result in the loss of retail and communications jobs, that both companies have a history of violating labor and employment laws, and that the proposed benefits (like increased rural coverage) are exaggerated.  The site features fact sheets on the impact of the merger in different states and for rural communities, news about ongoing developments, links documents like letters of oppositions by US lawmakers and documentation of regulatory hearings, and a form by which site users can file a public comment opposing the merger.</p><p>The CWA Steward Strong Web Portal provides training materials and resources for CWA stewards. It includes PDFs of the Steward Resource Manual, the Steward Participant Workbook, organizing and mobilizing resources, materials for worksite bulletin board, grievance handling resources, being a steward in a workplace without a contract training manual, and a stewards glossary.</p><p>Fair 5G is a project of the Communications Workers of America that provides resources for the deployment of wireless networks that supports digital equity, workers' rights and community benefits. It includes news and reports analyzing public-private partnerships on implementing 5G in US cities, the wireless resiliency cooperative framework, small cell deployment, and digital equity.</p><p>Build Broadband Better is an online petition created by the Communications Workers of America to support the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to grant states and communities across the United States to build and improve their broadband networks.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_ca6e9ebf3fc9753ac52248ba399bae82"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of  the original website at the time of the web crawl.
