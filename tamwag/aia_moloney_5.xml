            <p>New York University’s Division of Libraries, in conjunction with Glucksman Ireland House at New York University, purchased the Mick Moloney Collection of Irish-American Music and Popular Culture for the Archives of Irish America in 2006. Until transfer to Bobst Library under the supervision of its Head of Collections, Dr. Michael Nash, the materials in this collection were stored in Dr. Moloney’s house in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

        <scopecontent id="ref12">
            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Mick Moloney Irish American Music and Popular Culture Collection is composed of five parts. Taken together, they illustrate Dr. Moloney's career long engagement with two centuries of Irish-American musical culture (1806 to 2011, bulk dates 1975-2000) across a wide variety of media and from at least three perspectives: academic, professional and performative.</p>
            <p>Mick Moloney's videotape collection composes Part V of this collection. The tapes were made and/or collected in his capacity as a producer of albums of Irish traditional music; as a folklorist and academic; and as artistic director for International House Philadelphia and for the musical ensemble, The Green Fields of America. Part V provides resources for scholars whose focus is the Irish-American experience. Broad themes of immigration and assimilation can be viewed through the lens of Irish-America's engagement with and expression of its own popular culture, primarily its music.</p>
            <p>The era most well documented in the Moloney collection (1975-2000) witnessed both a reinvestment by Irish-America in its cultural traditions, and a transition of its musical traditions from home to the stage accompanied by unprecedented national recognition. In this regard, Part V may be of interest to those interested in tracing shifts in federal policies regarding arts funding and programming as well as those interested in the valorization of ethnicity in the U.S. from the 1970s on. In addition, one of Moloney's interests during this period was the rise in prominence of female performers of traditional music, of potential interest to those whose focus is gender. Part V is also very suited to those scholars and performers interested in the repertoire and performance practices of traditional musicians across a variety of ethnicities during the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold"> Series I: Videotapes, 1982-2000</emph> consists of videotapes pertaining primarily to Moloney's professional life as a performer, promoter, producer and fieldworker, supplemented by some items of personal interest.</p>
            <p>A large percentage of the tapes document Moloney's live performances, many at Irish and Folk festivals held in Washington, D.C. (Glen Echo), Dallas, Philadelphia and at the Augusta Heritage Center's Irish Week at Elkins College, W. Va. Moloney's touring ensemble, the Green Fields of America, and his collaboration with Robbie O'Connell and Jimmy Keane are particularly well represented.</p>
            <p>Equally significant are the large group of tapes dedicated the International Village Fair, sponsored by Philadelphia's International House in 1987. Moloney devoted a full year organizing this festival and Part V contains at least twenty-nine tapes detailing all aspects of the event and complimenting the extensive paper and photographic documentation found in Part III of the Moloney collection.</p>
            <p>In addition to video content, some of the tapes contain audio masters and safety copies of important recording sessions, both for Moloney and for the traditional ensemble, Cherish the Ladies.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>Other items of note in Part V are broadcasts; tapes related to Moloney's package tours of Ireland, including those sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution; and a recording of the ceremony at which Moloney received the National Heritage Fellowship Award in 1999.</p>
