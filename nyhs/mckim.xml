            <p>Charles McKim (1847–1909), William Rutherford Mead (1846–1928), and Stanford White (1853–1906) established their partnership in New York City in 1879 and soon became the premier architectural firm in the United States. Between 1879 and 1912, the firm received nearly 1000 commissions, designing a wide array of residential, institutional, commercial, and public buildings in New York and other cities. Influenced by their extensive travels (and training) in Europe, the firm designed primarily in the Beaux Arts style, becoming the leading proponents of a return to classicism as an expression of American architectural character. The firm's work at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, featuring the "White City," also helped to launch the "City Beautiful" movement.</p>
            <p>Among the firm's many notable buildings are Pennsylvania Station (1910, razed 1963), the Morgan Library and Museum (1903, expanded 1928), the Brooklyn Museum (1895), and the Municipal Building (1909-1915).</p>
            <p>While associated primarily with the Gilded Age, the firm continued for more than three decades after the death of the last founding partner (Mead) in 1928, and trained many significant 20th century architects, including John Carrere and Thomas Hastings.</p>

                    <p>Researchers wishing to access architectural drawings should be aware that due to their fragility and volume, special handling procedures apply to these materials. Accordingly, researchers should consult with the Print Room Librarian about how much time to budget when scheduling an appointment to view architectural drawings. The majority of drawings are stored on rolls; unrolling and rerolling these drawings is a time consuming process, so only a limited number of rolls can be viewed per visit. Multiple visits will be required for researchers wishing to view a significant number of drawings.</p>
                    <p>To preserve drawings for future research, the following restrictions apply:
                        <lb/></p>
                    <p>1. All research appointments must be scheduled in advance through the Print Room Librarian.
                        <lb/></p>
                    <p>2. Researchers will be required to wash their hands at the institution prior to handling archival materials.
                        <lb/> 3. Librarians will page only one tube or folder of architectural drawings at a time. No additional materials will be paged until all previously accessed drawings have been re-rolled and/or re-housed.
                        <lb/></p>
                    <p>4. No drawings will be paged after 2:00 PM (or within one hour of closing time).
                        <lb/></p>
                    <p>5. The Librarian has the discretion to limit the number of rolls a researcher may view per visit.
                        <lb/></p>
                    <p>6. Damaged or particularly fragile drawings may, in the Librarian’s discretion, be handled only under the direct supervision of a librarian or withheld pending review by the chief conservator.</p>

                        <p>Included in this series are approximately 61,150 rolled drawings for over 1000 commissioned projects. Approximately 65 percent of these are tracings (mostly ink on linen), and 35 percent are print duplicates (mostly blueprints on paper). They consist of plans, elevations, sections, exterior and interior details, full size details, sketches, and shop drawings. Projects include educational institutions, banks, country estates, residences, clubs and casinos, hotels, memorials, government buildings, public buildings, commercial buildings, libraries, museums, churches, and hospitals in New York and elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>The drawings were re-housed between 2009-2012 pursuant to a generous 
                            <emph render="italic">Save America's Treasures</emph> grant from the National Park Service, in partnership with the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute of Library and Museum Services, and the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities.</p>
                        <p>This subseries includes drawings of many of the firm's most important projects in New York City and elsewhere. An item-level inventory of the rolled drawings is available on-site.</p>

                        <p>This subseries is comprised of 68 boxes, primarily of photographs, but also including copy photos of architectural drawings, printed material (offprints from publications, entire publications, postcards), newspaper clippings, documents from Departments of Documents and Buildings (generally for New York City projects), handwritten notes, and sometimes correspondence or blueprints.</p>
                        <p>Most of the photographs are site photographs, showing exteriors and interiors, made either prior to, during, or after construction (but generally undated). Photographers included are Blackman Photo Service, Edwin J. Cardswell, Louis H. Dreyer, Gottscho-Schleisner, H. Ernest King, Schuyler Carteret Lee, J.C. Maugans, C. Ording, Richard Averill Smith, Adolph Studly, Tebbs Architectural Photos, Irving Underhill, United States Army Signal Corps, DeWitt Ward, and Wurts Bros.</p>
                        <p>The photographs are housed by size (small, medium and large), and within each size category are arranged alphabetically by project. A box and folder list is available on-site.</p>

                    <p>This series includes 30 blank-paged leather-bound volumes with photographs, maps, sketches, and/or floor plans pasted in. Some of the albums have been disbound and re-housed in folders due to their deteriorating condition. Most albums depict MM&amp;W projects and are devoted to either a particular project or a general category of work. There are also a few albums of non-MM&amp;W work which probably served as sourcebooks for the firm's architects to draw ideas from.</p>
                    <p>Detailed inventories for some of the scrapbooks are available on-site.</p>
