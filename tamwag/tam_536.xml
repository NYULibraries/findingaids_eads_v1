            <p>The collection consists of letters Sender Garlin wrote between 1980-1987 to Gil Green (1906-1997) a longtime leading member of the Communist Party USA, and at that time, the unofficial leader of its reformist wing, until he left the Party in 1991 to help found the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. The letters discuss personal matters and a wide range of domestic and international political issues, including the history and current state of labor and the left in the United States, and of the Communist Party USA. The letters are often accompanied by attached clippings.</p>
