    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Time Inc. published the first issue of <title render="italic">Life</title> on November 23, 1936. In the initial proposal to the board, the specifications were that it would be the same size as the <title render="italic">Illustrated London News</title>, printed on shiny paper with around 200 high-quality photographs recording significant current news events including detailed captions. Because the suggested price would be 10 cents per issue, the initial title was <title render="italic">Dime, The Show-Book of the World</title>. According to Elson, staff and charter subscribers were asked to submit other names, and the title <title render="italic">Life</title> was suggested by both cofounder Henry Luce's wife Clare Luce and Time Inc. president James Linen's father. Since the name was already in use by another publication, Luce purchased it in order to acquire the rights. </p><p>The first staff members in 1936 were Luce as managing editor with John Martin as an alternate, Daniel Longwell as picture editor, Alfred Eisenstaedt and Peter Stackpole as staff photographers, and Mary Fraser as copy chief.</p><p>For financial reasons, Time Inc. suspended production of <title render="italic">Life</title> as a weekly magazine in December 1972, but began planning a revival almost immediately. The Magazine Development department published the first <title render="italic">Life</title> special in 1973 as a newsstand magazine followed by nine more. Time Inc. revived <title render="italic">Life</title> as a monthly in 1978. In 2000, publication was again suspended, but revived in 2004 as a newspaper supplement. In 2007, Time Inc. completely ceased printing of <title render="italic">Life</title> and created a website for images from the collection.</p><p>
