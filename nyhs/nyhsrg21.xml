    <head>Processing Information Note</head>
<p>Various portions of records from the Library Department were physically processed during the early 1990s to the early 2000s, mostly in terms of compiling related material together in boxes and refoldering some documents to archival folders. In the fall of 2016, project archivist Larry Weimer established an overarching arrangement for all the Library Department records in the archive, added new material, and completed a baseline inventory and finding aid for the entire record group. Certain steps were taken with the material in 2016, including the refinement of the physical arrangement of folders and re-boxing, in order to facilitate its use by researchers, but an overall minimal level of physical processing was implemented. Consequently, most of the material remains in its original folders and unarranged within folders.</p>  </processinfo>

<p>This finding aid relates to just one record group of the New-York Historical Society archives. For information about the other record groups and for overall information about the archives, please see the <extref actuate="onRequest" href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrgarchives/">Guide to the New-York Historical Society Archives</extref> (NYHSRG Archives). Other record groups that are processed and available to researchers and are especially related to the New-York Historical Society Library Department records
(NYHS-RG 21) are as follows:</p><p>The N-YHS governance level minute books and so-called official papers include much material concerning N-YHS's library matters, especially with regard to acquisitions. For years through 1938, see: <extref actuate="onRequest" href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrg1/">New-York Historical Society management committee records</extref> (NYHS-RG 1). For years subsequent to 1938, see New-York Historical Society Board of Trustees records (NYHS-RG 18).</p><p>Library accessions were documented in ledgers from 1841-1962, with gaps. See <extref actuate="onRequest" href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrg15/">New-York Historical Society collection accession registers</extref> (NYHS-RG 15). </p><p>N-YHS's central correspondence files include documents relating to all aspects of NYHS operations, including the library, from the institution's earliest days to 1982. The correspondence includes acquisitions, early reference inquiries, and other matters. See <extref actuate="onRequest" href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrg2/">New-York Historical Society general correspondence</extref> (NYHS-RG 2). Some acquisition correspondence, especially related to bequests, but also gifts and some purchases, was placed with legal records; see New-York Historical Society legal matters (NYHS-RG 16).</p><p>The longtime assistant to Librarian Alexander Wall, Dorothy Barck was Librarian from 1942-1954. Her records are found in New-York Historical Society Librarian Dorothy C. Barck records (NYHS-RG 19).</p><p>There are many connections between N-YHS's library and museum, including collaborations on exhibitions, the transfer of the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture to the museum (1989) and back (1998), coordination of outgoing loans, and other matters. See New-York Historical Society Museum Department records (NYHS-RG 20).</p>  </relatedmaterial>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The New-York Historical Society Library Department records group includes a broad range of material related to the administration of the Library and its component sections, including the Reading Room, Manuscripts Department, Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC, often referred to as the Print Room), and the Conservation Lab. The subject matter spans the entire breadth of the Library's activities: acquisition of materials for the collection, curatorial and conservation surveys and assessments, collection inventorying and cataloging projects, in-house exhibitions and outgoing loans, and patron access and use of the collections. </p><p>The record group includes correspondence and memos, surveys, management reports, statistical information, policies, planning documents, budgets, appraisals, acquisitions (purchase, donation) and sales, contracts, visitor registers, grant applications and project implementation files, exhibition files (e.g., checklists, loan agreements, label texts), cataloging worksheets, and conservation reports. Most of these records date from the last three decades of the twentieth century and into the early twenty-first century (see the Related Materials Note for most earlier documents). An exception to this are the visitor registers; though there are sizable gaps in the nineteenth century, these records date from as early as 1838. The record group also holds nineteenth century admission tickets and calling cards used to introduce and permit non-members to use library resources.</p><p>The record group holds an array of collection descriptions and inventories compiled for various purposes over time, and these range from throughout N-YHS's history. For example, there is a circa 1826 inventory of maps, John Delafield's 1833 manuscript-form catalogue of the books in the library, the 1941 inventories of material sent off-site for storage during World War II, and a card catalog of comic books deaccessioned in the 1970s. Most of these inventories were prepared by N-YHS staff, but some in the record group were prepared by the collection donor or other outside party, such as the inventory of the Lathrop Colgate Harper Spanish-American War Collection distributed by Harper's estate.</p>  </scopecontent>

The entry for each book includes a list of the features for that issue. This box and the next also hold an A-Z index by feature title, linking it to the relevant book title/issue. The entries are on oversize slips of paper held by metal prongs. Because of the way the slips are secured some may be difficult to read fully; should those cards need to be read, the preservation lab should be consulted for document access. It is possible that these cards were compiled, not by N-YHS, but by the creator/donor of the collection.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref99_28n" level="file"><did><unittitle>Index to Deaccessioned Comic Books (2 of 2 boxes)</unittitle><unitdate>1970s</unitdate><container id="aspace_e7ab5bffd171e22f2026485d1f16c540" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">8</container><container parent="aspace_e7ab5bffd171e22f2026485d1f16c540" type="Cards">1-3</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref85_69d" level="file"><did><unittitle>Magazines &amp; Newspapers Received by N-YHS</unittitle><unitdate>1979 August</unitdate><container id="aspace_dcaa98d704d0996859932d3814df95ba" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">12</container><container parent="aspace_dcaa98d704d0996859932d3814df95ba" type="Folder">14</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref133_jx3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Newspaper Cataloging Project (NEH) (5 folders)</unittitle><unitdate>1982-1986</unitdate><container id="aspace_970b6f148ae92219700ee4b98574f315" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">16</container><container parent="aspace_970b6f148ae92219700ee4b98574f315" type="Folder">1-5</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref88_gw5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Print Room Collection Guide.

These relate principally to the period 1976 to 2001, though there are some records for 1964-1975. Appraisals and related inventories for many of these donations are included through about 1986. Slips of paper with summary information by donor for the 1960s-1993 are in the series, as are a small number of acquisition related logs and system print-outs. The series also includes some records of library purchases, including purchases from 1979-1982 from Baker &amp; Taylor, Gale Research,  Heckman Bindery, university presses, subscription services, microfilm vendors, bookshops, publishers, and others.</p><p>This series includes those acquisition records found as standalone files during processing of the archive in 2016.

Accordingly, the files hold a combination of management-level material (e.g., budgets and expense information, grants and grant proposals, annual or other management progress reports, activity statistics, staff memos, correspondence, general exhibition planning, fellowship proposals, donations, and acquisitions) as well as routine transactional documents (e.g., invoices for Baker &amp; Taylor, Readmore, Blackwell, RLG/RLIN and other library purchases and subscriptions). </p><p>There is considerable overlap in the subject matter of this series and the next, Series III. Librarian and Curatorial Files. There likely is no sharp distinction between them, but generally the content of the files in Series III seems more attributable to particular leaders in the library, while these general files seem to have a more varied provenance, including miscellaneous files added to the series by archivists over time.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref298_hr6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence Files.

These include Librarians (i.e., head of the Library) James Gregory (1966-1980), Larry Sullivan (1980-1984), Paul Cohen (1984-1987), James Mooney (1987-1989), Jean Ashton (1990-1993), Margaret Heilbrun (1993-2003), and, returning to N-YHS from Columbia University, Jean Ashton (2006-2012). Also included are files from manuscript curators Arthur Breton (1960s), Thomas Dunnings (1970s-1980s and institutional archivist, 1990-1993), Margaret Heilbrun (1987-1993), and Donna Davey (circa 2001-2004).</p><p>The series includes a broad range of subject matter, including budgets, management reports, statistics, library policies, exhibition planning, grants and projects (e.g., microfilming, cataloging, institutional archive, digitization), acquisitions and sales through Swann Galleries and other dealers, donations, collection surveys and consultant reports, general correspondence including inquiries and permissions, conservation, research fellowships, and more.

There is significant overlap in the content and date range of the sets. Set 1 includes relatively well-structured subject files in alphabetical order that date primarily, though not exclusively, from Heilbrun's tenure as head of the Library. Set 2 includes a less structured mix of subject matter that date primarily, though not exclusively from Heilbrun's years as curator of manuscripts prior to leading the Library. Set 3 includes records from her last two years at N-YHS. Set 4 includes various materials associated with Heilbrun and Heilbrun's years in the Library that were compiled from loose and unorganized documents by the processing archivist in 2016.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref394_bba" level="file"><did><unittitle>Arthur Breton Files (3 folders)</unittitle><unitdate>1962-1972</unitdate><container id="aspace_af60817a09665c51e71dcf7e5d5d72be" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">110</container><container parent="aspace_af60817a09665c51e71dcf7e5d5d72be" type="Folder">1-3</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_3464619f77660b999cceeb8d44fff8e7"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes correspondence including that concerning Breton's manuscript guide.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref396_xpk" level="file"><did><unittitle>Thomas Dunnings Files (1 of 4 boxes)</unittitle><unitdate>1963-1992</unitdate><container id="aspace_aa46fd2cdacdb9c74cc65a13dc20fba6" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">111</container><container parent="aspace_aa46fd2cdacdb9c74cc65a13dc20fba6" type="Folder">1-28</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_46ce841f934bff57f8faf20724abf374"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes, among other topics, exhibition (manuscripts on display, FDR, Washington, Great Fire, and Constitution), papers location guide, and AMC logs.

Accordingly, records related to PPAC (also known as the Print Room) can be found in New-York Historical Society Museum Department records (NYHS-RG 20).</p></relatedmaterial><bioghist id="aspace_46919f9246c7035bce9e327f4978e521"><head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>Although prints, photographs and architectural plans have been collected at N-YHS since the nineteenth century, the institutional history of what is now known as the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC) begins more recently, in 1939. In that year, N-YHS opened its newly expanded and renovated building on Central Park West. Within the larger space, a new room was designated the "Map and Print Room" to house the collection (which included photographs even though the word was absent from the "M&amp;P" Room's title). More importantly, staff was hired and assigned to the care of these collections. At the same time, as the professional staff expanded throughout N-YHS, an organizational division developed between the Library and the Museum, each gaining its own head who reported to the chief executive officer, then called the Director. Prior to 1938, both branches of N-YHS's cultural resources reported to the Librarian. The Map and Print Room did not form a third branch, remaining within Library management.

Over the following decades, the scope of the collections of the Map and Print Room evolved with institutional changes. Responsibility for architecture was added from the Manuscript Department while maps were transferred to the Reading Room. Drawings were transferred to the Museum while the Bella Landauer collection was added. Landauer's collection of business and advertising ephemera came to N-YHS in 1926. It too was housed in a separate room at Central Park West where Landauer continued to add to the collection and work on it as honorary curator until her death in 1960. By 1973, Wilson Duprey was no longer Curator of Maps and Prints, but simply Curator of Prints. Similarly, the Map and Print Room became known as the Print Room, a name that, although referring to a physical location,  has stuck informally over time to refer to the print, photograph and architecture collections and staff more generally. Certainly, in the records of this series and the institutional records overall, reference to Print Room will be commonly found, as in the title of the 1983 <emph render="italic">Print Room Collection Guide</emph>, an unpublished in-house finding aid. 

The 1980s and 1990s, the years that are most extensively documented at present in this series, saw significant developments in the management of these collections. In terms of overall responsibility, in the early 1980s executive management considered transferring the Print Room collections from the Library to the Museum, but with no appetite for this within either department, the move did not take place. But this proved to be just a postponement as the transfer eventually did occur, in 1989. As part of a reorganization of N-YHS at that time, a number of functions were consolidated under the leadership of the new Museum Director, Holly Hotchner. With their transfer to the Museum, the Print Room collections and staff took on a new name, which remains today: the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (PPAC). 

PPAC remained with the Museum only eight years, transferring back to the Library in 1998, where it remains today. Yet during that brief time, several important initiatives were implemented. In 1992, Helena Zinkham, a former curator of prints in PPAC, completed her work on a preliminary guide to the print, photograph and architecture collection. Initially only an in-house guide, funds were eventually raised for the publication of the <emph render="italic">Guide</emph> in 1997. Wendy Shadwell, who had been Curator of Prints since 1974, was joined by two additional experts, Mary Beth Betts as Curator of Architectural Collections (1990-1999) and Dale Neighbors as Curator of Photography (1987-1998). The extent of surveying and cataloging of the collections increased, as did exhibitions drawing on them, including <emph render="italic">McKim, Mead &amp; White's New York</emph> (1991) and <emph render="italic">Building City Hall: Competition, Construction and Context</emph> (1992). With the shift of PPAC back to the Library in 1998, PPAC continued both in its traditional role of providing material in support of exhibitions mounted by the Museum and Library, as well as installing exhibitions based on its collections. And under the leadership of Marilyn Kushner, PPAC's Curator and Head since 2006, the department has moved beyond these boundaries, perhaps most notably in Dr. Kushner's curatorship of the landmark <emph render="italic">Armory Show at 100</emph> exhibition and its related Internet-based resources.

Specifically, the subseries includes files of Curator of Prints Wendy Shadwell (1974-2002), Curator of Architecture Mary Beth Betts (1990-1999), Curators of Photographs Dale Neighbors (1987-1998) and Holly Hinman (1998-2004?), and Directors Pamela Dewey (1998-2000?) and Valerie Komor (2000-2003). The date ranges indicate the time the individual held the position, not necessarily the date range of the records held in their files. The records, although associated here with particular individuals, commonly hold documents from their predecessors and likely also include files of other individuals that mixed in over time.</p><p>The files hold a range of materials concerning exhibitions, collections, conservation, and administrative matters. The container list provides summary descriptions for the principal subject content that is held within each box. The content can be further summarized as follows:</p><p>Wendy Shadwell's files include the broadest range of materials over the longest period of time. These files include internal memos, statistics, monthly reports, planning documents, budgets, consultant reports, collection inventories, acquisition documentation, reference inquiries, presentations to school groups, and conservation matters. The acquisition documents include index cards maintained by Shadwell's predecessor with notes on donations from 1969-1974.</p><p>Mary Beth Betts's files center on the architectural collections and primarily include her working files for several exhibitions, especially <emph render="italic">McKim, Mead &amp; White's New York</emph> and <emph render="italic">Building City Hall: Competition, Construction and Context</emph>, which drew on the John McComb collection. Betts's files also include correspondence related to the architectural collections and grants, particularly for Cass Gilbert-related projects. Associated with Betts, though not directly attributed to her files in the container list, are cataloging worksheets for the McComb, Pollard, Davis and Cass Gilbert collections.</p><p>Dale Neighbors's files also include exhibition-related material, especially related to the 1995 gallery re-opening <emph render="italic">Treasury of the Past</emph>. Various exhibition possibilities are documented here, including some material for the planning in the late 1990s of a rotation of core New York City history-themed exhibitions. Likely in connection with one of these possibilities is a set of mounted newspaper photograph clippings apparently from the 1950s-1970s and at least in part from a series "New York's Changing Scene." Some administrative files relevant to the photograph collections are found here, including grants, acquisition possibilities, planning, and facilities. In connection with this last subject, there are three oversize plans from architect Richard Jansen for the existing and planned lay-out of the Print Room (1990). </p><p>Neighbors's files also hold documentation of two projects: Helena Zinkham's <emph render="italic">A Guide to Print, Photograph, Architectural and Ephemera Collections at N-YHS</emph> and consideration of creating a "daybook"/calendar with photographs and other images from the collections. The Zinkham records include correspondence, inventories, drafts, and other materials concerning the development of her unpublished preliminary Guide (1992) and the final published edition (1998).</p><p>Files from Neighbors's successor, Holly Hinman, primarily include information on various then-active photographers, likely in connection with potential acquisitions or exhibition. Many of the files have color slides, photographic prints, or digital media of the photographers' works; the container list entry includes the names of those photographers with such media in the files. Also included in the subseries are files concerning various surveys of the collections of negatives.</p><p>The Pamela Dewey and Valerie Komor files include grant proposals for conservation, digitization, and other matters; processing and project plans for cataloging and other description initiatives, including the monthly status reports for the Mellon-funded visual materials cataloging project; general correspondence and internal memos; collection descriptions, such as inventories, lists, surveys, counts, and acquisitions/donations; and administrative issues, such as the move of the Print Room to the 2nd floor. These files also include reports from the Mellon-funded studies on contemporary/contemporaneous collecting and information about the Landauer collection, such as the transfer of objects to the museum and a folder of clippings and original magazines with articles dating from the 1940s-70s, among other documents. </p><p>The subseries also holds files concerning the "Here is New York" collection and, to a lesser extent, the 2007 exhibition of the same name.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_1a884b328d9d592f7a957c69be821a4f"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The subseries is arranged by curator/director files in roughly chronological order.

The earliest files, from the 1940s and 1950s, appear to have been compiled at a later date by Wendy Shadwell and often include photographs of objects and the exhibition galleries. Later files often include photocopies of images of objects, but not of the galleries. Generally, the records are working files recording selections from the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture (i.e., PPAC, or sometimes referred to as the Print Room) for museum and library exhibitions and the return of the items to the Print Room. Later files have the call slips for the selected documents. Many of the files have checklists, text, some research files, etc. The container list includes notes indicating those exhibitions that appear to have folders with more substantive or extensive documentation; the exhibition names used in the container list generally come from the original folder labels and likely do not match the actual exhibition titles precisely.</p><p>A particularly rich set of documents in this subseries relates to the 2013 exhibition <emph render="italic">The Armory Show at 100</emph>. The subseries holds the files of exhibition curator Marilyn Kushner, which include checklists, loan documentation, design plans, publicity, and other documents. </p><p>Subsequent to the major processing project in 2016, additional files of exhibitions curated or organized by the Department of Prints, Photographs and Architecture from 2016 and later were transferred to the archives and these are included in the subseries as well.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref721_zkx" level="file"><did><unittitle>Exhibitions. 1940s (7 folders)</unittitle><unitdate>1940-1949</unitdate><container id="aspace_6fb2d070bb15bf6fb5f0c111777d40db" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">251</container><container parent="aspace_6fb2d070bb15bf6fb5f0c111777d40db" type="Folder">1-7</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_64c69bbc8d271083b8b03641e02bac36"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes photographs for Emma Thursby Memorial, Allied Artists, Jenny Lind, Our GIs in Seven Wars, American Presentation Silver, Audubon, Historic Hudson in Prints, News Artists to the American People, American &amp;

First are the lab's files of outgoing loans and in-house exhibitions from 1989 to 2005. Second are the files (1990-1993) of Associate Librarian for Preservation Duane Watson and those of his colleague, Stacks Manager Christine Seeto. Finally, there are records of a daguerreotype (cased images) conservation survey from 1992-1993. </p><p>The outgoing loan files are generally fairly slender, with uneven content. Many include conservation treatment notes, but others include just the record of the approved loan or general correspondence  about the loans. Some post-2000 files include color slides of the loaned objects. In-house exhibition files tend to be more extensive, reflecting the broader involvement of the lab with these activities. These exhibition files commonly include not only condition and treatment reports, but also basic information about the objects in relation to the exhibition, including labels, checklists, display logistics, etc. The loan and exhibition files include folder lists at the front of each box.</p><p>The Watson records are generally of a more administrative and broader nature, and less focused on individual objects. Watson's records include budgets, survey results, performance statistics, internal memos, conservation reference material, grants, and grant project activities. Seeto's records are concerned with stack surveys, movements of material within the stacks and other such logistical matters.</p></scopecontent><relatedmaterial id="aspace_5ccb7297a914172abd4cd78503aae532"><head>Related Archival Materials Note</head><p>Files on conservation matters, including grants, projects, preservation microfilming, etc. can be found in the above series as well, especially Series IV.

Seeto's files are also in their original folders and original order, which seems to have no particular arrangement.</p></arrangement><bioghist id="aspace_11580fb943c38f92c9969a824294abcc"><head>Biographical/Historical Note</head><p>Aside from a bindery that operated from 1929 until about 1960, N-YHS had no in-house conservation unit until the mid-1980s when it began to build such a staff, initially for the museum. Professional conservators arrived in the library when paper and book conservation labs were opened in early 1989. In 1990, Duane Watson was hired as Associate Librarian for Preservation, a position he held until he left N-YHS in early 1993. In this position, Watson was responsible for overseeing object-level conservation efforts for the library and the management of the collection in the stacks. This latter responsibility was carried out in the early 1990s principally by Stacks Manager Christine Seeto. Down to the present (2016), N-YHS's library has continued to maintain a conservation lab, headed since the mid-1990s by chief conservator, Alan Balicki. Among the conservation staff's many responsibilities has been the assessment of outgoing loans of objects (e.g., conditions of objects, proper housing, conditions at the borrower site) and preparation of objects for in-house exhibitions.</p></bioghist><c id="aspace_ref805_qo5" level="file"><did><unittitle>Outgoing Loan Files (1 of 2 boxes)</unittitle><unitdate>1989-1999</unitdate><container

The bulk of these records date from about 1909-2010 and record both member and non-member use of the library. A few records from the nineteenth and early twentieth century, from as early as 1838, include non-member visits, but there are relatively few of these, and there are sizable gaps in the date coverage. These records hold only spare indicators of individual visits, with no details such as specific resources used. Any such detailed records that might exist are not held in the institutional archive. </p><p>In addition to the required sign-ins, the subseries includes a ceremonial "Register of Distinguished Visitors" that includes signatures from three events:  the 1939 opening of the renovated N-YHS building, the 1954 dinner held at the Union Club to celebrate N-YHS's 150th anniversary, and the 1957 event for the 200th anniversary of Lafayette's birth. Other registers include visitor comment books (1990-1992, 2005-2007) on the galleries and various exhibitions. The subseries does not include comment books from specific exhibitions; these can be found with the files of the pertinent exhibition, principally in the New-York Historical Society Museum Department records (NYHS-RG 20).</p><p>The subseries also includes various documents related to visitors and access to N-YHS resources. These include a Librarian Receipt Book in which books borrowed from the library, a member privilege in the organization's early years, were recorded (1829-1853); daily visitor counts from certain periods (1869, 1918-1937, and 1987-1990); and member and non-member admission cards (mostly undated but likely from the mid-late 1800s).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_e1dc40f76f43cc7ca88bba3400e77df8"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>The subseries opens with the visitor sign-in books and sheets, followed by the various forms of related material.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref840_wcv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Visitors Register</unittitle><unitdate>1838-1846</unitdate><container id="aspace_8d8b61311c3a99cf8b0883f8b4f725e2" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">RG21</container><container parent="aspace_8d8b61311c3a99cf8b0883f8b4f725e2" type="Volume">4</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref841_miu" level="file"><did><unittitle>Visitors Register</unittitle><unitdate>1859-1873, 1889</unitdate><container id="aspace_b75800310b41e11003617ad30b20d7f0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">RG21</container><container parent="aspace_b75800310b41e11003617ad30b20d7f0" type="Volume">5</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_2a680813a9aa4a6b0314546e5db1b0b5"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Entries for October 1868 and October 1889 consist of the names of delegates to the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church held in New York City in those years.
