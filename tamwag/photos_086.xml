            <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy be made, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@library.nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA), founded in 1947 as an industrial union of telephone industry workers, was the culmination of nearly a half-century of struggle for telephone unionism. Its first president was Joseph A. Beirne, who had led its predecessor union, the National Federation of Telephone Workers (NFTW), in an organizing campaign and a nation-wide strike in 1946 that resulted in the first national agreement with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T).</p>
            <p>During the next twenty-five years under the leadership Beirne, the CWA moved aggressively to organize all the telephone workers in the United States. It was not until 1974, however, after years of labor-management unrest and a series of strikes, that AT&amp;T agreed to system-wide collective bargaining. Shortly after the national contract was signed, Joseph Beirne died and was replaced as President by Secretary-Treasurer Glenn E. Watts. In the 1960s, the CWA became an active participant in international labor activities supporting the United States government’s Cold War policies through the union’s involvement in organizations such as the CIA- and USAID (United States Agency for International Development)- financed American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD).</p>
            <p>In the 1980s the CWA began to expand beyond telecommunications, creating a Public Employees Department that successfully organized 34,000 New Jersey state workers in 1981. In 1985 Morton Bahr became the CWA President. In 1987 the CWA merged with the International Typographical Workers Union. In 1992 it absorbed the National Association of Broadcast Employees and the Newspaper Guild merged with the CWA. By the 2000s the CWA had become one of the United States' largest and strongest unions with more than 600,000 members.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                    <p>Series I: Photographic Prints consists of approximately 4,300 prints--mainly 8x10” black and white photographs, with a small number of 3x4” and 3x5” black and white snapshots. Most of the images date from the 1960s to the 1980s. A handful, drawn from the records of predecessor or related earlier unions (some of which merged with the CWA) such as the International Typographical Union (ITU), Association of Communications Equipment Workers (ACEW), and National Federation of Telephone Workers (NFTU), date from the1910s, 1920s, and 1930s (many of these may be found in the Oversized Photographs series). Photographs of CWA President Joseph A. Beirne and his family, other union officers, CWA conventions, conferences and meetings, and other union activities (including organizing, dinners, receptions and the union’s support for scholarships and charities) dominate the collection. Through images of their officers and members, locals from across the country are represented, including those from Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, reflecting a strong southern regional presence.</p>
                    <p>A large portion of the collection (its single largest series) also documents the union’s international activities, through images showing its officers attendance at international conferences of telephone workers and allied unions in Europe, Asia and the South Pacific, Latin America, and international labor, as well as visits by representatives of foreign unions to United States. These international images reflect the union’s involvement in Cold War politics through its friendly relationships with the CIA- and USAID (United States Agency for International Development)- financed American Institute for Free Labor Development (AIFLD), with labor unions in South Vietnam, and exiled Cuban labor unions.</p>
                    <p>Also well-represented are images showing the union’s close relationships with leading American politicians, officials, and political figures (mainly Democratic) through photographs of CWA leaders posed with most of the sitting United States Presidents from Truman through Carter, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, Eleanor Roosevelt, Arthur Goldberg, and Dean Rusk, members of Congress including Senators John F., Robert F., and Edward M. Kennedy, Kefauver, Mondale, Morse, and members of the House of Representatives, including both (then-Congressmen) Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy; Andrew Young, and Thomas “Tip” O’Neill, as well as with labor leaders such as George Meany and Walter Reuther. Occasionally a celebrity from outside the worlds of politics and labor makes an appearance, such as actors and comedians Charleton Heston, Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis, and Linda Lavin. A smaller, but significant number of images document bargaining, strikes, demonstrations, and parades, members at work (mainly female telephone operators), and changes in telecommunications technology.</p>
                    <p>Many photographs have captions, dates, and identifications of persons written on their reverse sides. Individual photographs or groups of photographs have been assigned unique numbers or number/letter combinations, which are written inside square brackets on the back of each print.</p>
