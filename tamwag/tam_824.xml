    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz (1945-2018) was an American writer, educator, and political activist whose efforts focused on economic and social justice. She was one of the founders of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ) and served as the organization's first Executive Director. Kaye/Kantrowitz self-identified as a "Conscious Jew"; she was a member of the Jewish feminist organization Di Vilde Chayes, and her activism often focused on anti-semetism, anti-racism, and economic justice. She was additionally a co-founder of <emph render="italic">Beyond the Pale</emph> (weekly radio program of JFREJ), an editor for the publication <emph render="italic">Sinister Wisdom</emph>, and was on the steering committee for the New Jewish Agenda.
<lb/>
<lb/>
Kaye/Kantrowitz was a college professor who lectured on women's studies, comparative literature, urban studies, gender and queer studies, Jewish studies, and public policy programs at various institutions including Hamilton College, Vermont College, and Queens College. Kaye/Kantrowitz was a published essayist and poet, and authored several books including: <emph render="italic">We Speak in Code: Poems and Other Writings</emph> (1980); <emph render="italic">The Tribe of Dina: A Jewish Women's Anthology</emph> (1989); <emph render="italic">My Jewish Face, and Other Stories</emph> (1990); <emph render="italic">The Issue is Power: Essays on Women, Jews, Violence and Resistance</emph> (1995); and <emph render="italic">The Colors of Jews: Racial Politics and Radical Diasporism</emph> (2007).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Custodial History</head>
<p>The materials were originally stored in boxes in the donor and Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz's home. Some materials may have previously been kept in Kaye/Kantrowitz's offices in Queens College before being transferred to her home. Between April 2022 and January 2023, the boxes were condensed from the original number, having been reboxed by the donor, after they reviewed materials and separated out what they felt was not relevant or personal in nature. The material did not have a specific arrangement or filing system, but there were clear groupings which included files on teaching, writings, journals, and JFREJ organizational material. 
<lb/>
<lb/>
As of February, 2023 the donor will retain some of Kaye/Kantrowitz's original writings, but with a possibility of future donations. Similarly, as of the initial site visit, Kaye/Kantrowitz's computer files are not accessible.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>At the time of accessioning in June/July 2023, materials were rehoused in archival boxes and described in a box-level inventory.</p><p>In July/August 2023 all original folders were replaced with acid-free. Duplicates of press clippings, event programs, and promotional fliers were removed. Course readings folders were condensed from their individual folders and grouped together. Loose journals, notebooks, and datebooks were arranged in chronological order and foldered. Oversized material was unfolded and placed in appropriately-sized housing. Social security numbers on two agreements were redacted. The one audiocassette was numbered, labeled, and placed in a shared box. Titles were created by the processing archivist, often supplementing information provided on original folder titles. Potentially offensive terms considered outdated were retained by the processor when included in a title of essay or article, or college course.</p><p>The donor agreed the diaries and journals were not to be restricted with the understanding that although they were at times of a personal nature, these items were often the inspiration for many of Kaye/Kantrowitz's writings and stories.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz Papers contain material dating from the 1970s to the 2010s documenting her personal life and professional career, as well as the ways in which her identity as a lesbian, anti-racism and economic justice activist, and member of the Jewish community influenced this work. This collection contains published writings including short stories, poetry, reviews, as well as essays and articles on anti-semitism, homophobia, immigration, racism and anti-racism, and relations between Israel and Palestine. Her college and university course syllabi and notes in this collection reflect topics she also wrote about and supported, including women's and Jewish history. Her correspondence reflects both her personal relationships with others and her life as an educator, writer, and activist during the 1970s to 2010s. Journals, notebooks, and datebooks provide a daily record of her life, but also were often used as inspiration for many of her creative writing projects. Event files containing programs and promotional material document the Jewish Left and feminist environment in the 1970s through 2000s through the wide range of conferences and panels she participated in. The majority of material in this collection related to Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ) are publications, organization promotional material, and event fliers.</p>  </scopecontent>

The majority of this series consists of published works within large and smaller circulated publications including reviews of books and performances; letters to the editor; and articles. Topics for articles and essays were in line with her activism including sexism, Black and Jewish relations, racism, antisemitism, and homophobia. Her identity as a Jewish lesbian and her opinions on the Israel and Palestine conflict were also often essay and article subjects. This series contains a small amount of work files for some of her published books including <emph render="italic">The Tribe of Dina: A Jewish Women's Anthology</emph>; <emph render="italic">My Jewish Face</emph>; <emph render="italic">The Issue is Power</emph>; and <emph render="italic">The Colors of Jews</emph>. Work files typically include notes, contracts, mock-ups, press clippings, reader reviews, agreements, and promotional material. Inspiration for her published short stories and poems within this series can often be traced back to entries in her journals and notebooks which are in Series IV.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_0fed9fd0ed43262e16927cd3789ac80b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Reviews and Letters to the Editor by Kaye/Kantrowitz</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1974/1977" type="inclusive">1974-1977</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Most of the material in this series was generated while teaching courses at Hamilton College, Vermont College, and Queens College. Course topics often intersected with Kaye/Kantrowitz's writings and activism, including Jewish women's history; women's history; race; antisemitism; class; gender; urban planning; and political activism. Course files typically include syllabi; lecture notes; student's course reviews; course descriptions; and articles chosen by Kaye/Kantrowitz for course readings. This series also includes her resume; grant reports; teaching applications; ideas for women's history programs at colleges; support material for promotions; and a legal settlement regarding a dispute with Queens College.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_c03766d3c9b535ab9fab3ef741ffdb13" level="file"><did><unittitle>Class -- The Politics of Art</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1979" type="inclusive">Spring 1970s</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

These events usually centered around a topic or cause in which Kaye/Kantrowitz was an advocate or organizer, including racism and anti-racism; women's history; homophobia; anti-semitism; economic and social justice; Black and Jewish relations; and issues surrounding the country of Israel. Files on individual events typically include speech notes, promotional material, schedules, programs, and press clippings. An audio recording of a 1978 conference is also in this series. Event files grouped by decade contain promotional fliers and posters.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_780e646f08ac68d75fcbc88a50140205" level="file"><did><unittitle>Northeast Modern Language Association (NeMLA) Women and Literature Section -- Speech Re: Feminist Criticism</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1974/1974">April 5, 1974</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Journal daily accounts provide insight into her personal life as a lesbian and Jewish woman during the 1970s to 2010s, while also dovetailing with her work as a professor, writer, and activist. The journals in this series also include portions of letters, creative writings, and recountings of her dreams. Her creative writings were often influenced and inspired by events in her life, pulled from her journals. These journals bring context to her published works in Series I. The notebooks in this series contain writing ideas, to do lists, and contact lists. Datebooks include her daily appointements dating from 1979 to 2009. Her passport from circa 1975 is also in this series, documenting her travel during this time.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_4a3a45b88ac5c0210279d1130f66ec93" level="file"><did><unittitle>Journal Entries, Notes, and Writings</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1970/1979" type="inclusive">1970s</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
