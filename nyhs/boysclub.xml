            <abstract id="ref964" label="Abstract">This collection contains organizational records and photographs documenting the history and operations of The Boys' Club of New York ("BCNY"). BCNY was founded in 1876 to provide poor immigrant boys in what is now the East Village with an alternative to street life. Records span the period from its inception to the early 21st century, and include minutes, annual reports, correspondence, publications, financial records, and papers of the alumni association. Photographs make up a significant portion of the collection and provide an especially rich record of the organization's activities in the 1940's and 1950's.</abstract>

            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Founding of The Boys' Club of New York ("BCNY")</emph></p>
            <p>BCNY was founded in 1876 by railroad magnate E.H. Harriman (1848-1909). Harriman apparently conceived the idea after visiting the Wilson Mission School, a charitable institution on Manhattan's Lower East Side that trained poor, young girls in the neighborhood for industrial employment. Deciding that neighborhood boys would benefit from a similar type of program, Harriman rented space in the basement of the Wilson Mission School and opened the Tompkins Square Boys' Club. From its initial enrollment of only a handful of boys, Harriman's organization grew into the largest and oldest boys' club in the country, one that has played a significant role in the history of the New York neighborhoods in which it operates.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Clubhouses</emph></p>
            <p>In the early years, Harriman aimed chiefly to provide recreation for the boys, a physical place that would entice them off the streets and into supervised activities. By 1896, membership had grown to over 200 boys, and the three basement rooms in the Wilson Mission School were no longer adequate. In 1901, with money advanced by Harriman, the Club opened its own, purpose-designed building at Avenue A and 10th Street (the "Tompkins Square Building," later renamed the Harriman Clubhouse). Reflecting the influence of the settlement house movement, this six-floor building featured amenities designed to foster a sense of community and help immigrant boys assimilate to American values, including shower baths, lecture rooms, a library, a natural history museum with butterflies, stuffed birds, and other specimens, a movable stage, and a gymnasium. In 1917, a new addition to the Tompkins Square Clubhouse was completed, featuring an indoor roof pool.</p>
            <p>A program of further expansion began in the 1920's, led by then President Charles Sabin, who wanted to establish BCNY branches all over the city. The first additional branch (the "Jefferson Club Parkhouse," renamed the Elbridge T. Gerry, Jr. Clubhouse in 2007) opened in 1927 at 321 E. 111th Street in what is now East Harlem. Selected on the basis of extensive demographic research, this neighborhood was targeted to serve the large influx of Italian immigrants, who at the time made up more than 90% of the community. With the opening of a second clubhouse, the club's original "Tompkins Square Boys' Club" moniker was no longer accurate, and BCNY officially changed its corporate name to The Boys' Club of New York.</p>
            <p>In 1954, BCNY opened a "mobile" branch, the Central Park Clubhouse at 110th Street and Fifth Avenue. Instead of constructing another fully equipped building, BCNY decided to lease space and provide basic services to community boys, supplemented by other community programs and the facilities at the nearby Jefferson Park Clubhouse. Its rationale for this approach was that it would afford BCNY greater flexibility to move to a new location as the neighborhood improved. Five years later, BCNY opened the Pitt Street Clubhouse on the Lower East Side (at Pitt and East Houston Streets) to serve as a "satellite" to the Tompkins Square/Harriman Clubhouse. Although the Central Park Clubhouse was closed in 1961, when its lease expired, the Pitt Street Clubhouse (expanded and renamed the Milliken Clubhouse in 1985) continued to operate until 2003.</p>
            <p>More than a century after its founding, BCNY expanded its operations beyond Manhattan. In 1992, after taking over the existing Flushing Boys' Clubs, BCNY began operating another clubhouse in Queens (the "Flushing Clubhouse"). By 2001, membership had grown to over 1800 boys, and in December of that year, work began on a new facility. The Marion McMahon Abbe Clubhouse opened on September 25, 2003.</p>
            <p>Although BCNY’s programs have evolved over time, the three clubhouses in operation at the time this collection was processed in 2016 -- the Harriman (formerly Tompkins Square) Clubhouse on the Lower East Side; the Elbridge T. Gerry, Jr. (formerly Jefferson Park) Clubhouse in East Harlem; and the Marion McMahon Abbe Clubhouse in Queens – remain at the core of a continuous tradition of providing community-based services to underprivileged boys.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Admission and Programs</emph></p>
            <p>Initially, membership was free to all boys "who behaved themselves with reasonable propriety." By 1893, a new policy required each boy to pay a penny, for which he received a monthly membership ticket specifying the special privileges to which his membership entitled him. Throughout its history, BCNY has prided itself on having an "Open Door Policy" which admits any boy, regardless of differences in attitude, cultural patterns, or spiritual beliefs. Although adopted at a time when members were predominantly or wholly white immigrants (especially Italians), BCNY continued this policy in the face of changing racial demographics. By the 1940's and 1950's, African American boys made up a significant portion of BCNY membership, which continued to increase throughout the second half of the twentieth century. The records suggest that these shifts in membership also influenced the evolution of BCNY's programs.</p>
            <p>Many of the fundamental programs of BCNY were instituted by the Club's first professional paid staff member, Francis Hebard Tabor, hired in 1898 as club superintendent. A 33-year-old Cambridge University graduate, Tabor had spent many years working among the poor of London. Tabor started a weekly in-house newspaper, established a sports program, instituted annual Gilbert and Sullivan operetta performances, and encouraged the boys to form small clubs headed by member "leaders.” Long after Tabor left the Club in 1911 (to found the St. Bernard's School for Boys in Manhattan), his programs continued to influence the course and direction of BCNY activities. Increasingly, these activities were focused on shaping the character of boys who were members, rather than simply entertaining or keeping them out of trouble. An Employment Agency began in 1905; the athletic program was expanded; and classes were offered in stenography, telegraph operation and to prepare interested members for the civil service exam. With the addition of a pool to the Tompkins Square Building in 1917, the Club turned out numerous swimming champions, including George Kojac, a 1928 Olympic gold-medal winner, and George "Dutch" Fissler, who in 1927 broke the world's record in both the one hundred-meter and four hundred meter back stroke.</p>
            <p>Although athletics have always been a mainstay of BCNY activities, the focus of its other programs have shifted with the times. In 1912, a moving picture booth was installed in the Tompkins Square game room, providing the boys with "newfangled" entertainment every Friday night. In 1918, when the U.S. entered WWI, the Club began providing every member with a physical exam, and complete dental clinics were opened in 1922. During WWII, additional exercise rooms were added to prepare boys for the Armed Services, and new activities related to the war effort, such as radio construction and communication, and machine shop work, were introduced. After the war, a Veterans Guidance Bureau was established at the Tompkins Square Building, offering job training and placement and continuing education. In the post-war years, arts programs -- including glee club, drama, art classes, music and dancing -- also proved very popular. BCNY also sponsored various events, including pet shows, "Little Sister" shows, and a "Boys' Club Day" at the New York World's Fair. In 1953, members traveled to London for a boxing match against the London Federation of Boys -- which BCNY won -- and a re-match was held in New York the following year, with BCNY again victorious.</p>
            <p>The education program, which would eventually be regarded as perhaps BCNY's most significant activity, got its start in 1927 when William Finkelnagel, a former BCNY member and an engineer for Consolidated Gas, established an educational fund. Additional funds for the education program were provided through a legacy from former BCNY director Curtis Wheeler, who died in a tragic airplane accident that same year. But it wasn’t until 1957 that BCNY’s hallmark education program was begun with a bequest from former Trustee Victor Morawetz. The Morawetz Fund established a program to identify, prepare, place and support Boys' Club members at many of the nation's independent boarding and day schools, including Phillips Andover, Mount Hermon, Exeter and Taft -- a program that still operates as the Independent School Placement Program. In many instances these young men were the first students of color to attend these private schools.</p>
            <p>In 1982, a job-training program was instituted, reflecting the Club's increasing emphasis on education and skill development. The Boys' Club Summer School, started in 1985, is held at Camp Cromwell during July and August. In 2014, the Club's programs centered around the following five categories: Character Development and Life Skills, Sports and Recreation, Academic Support and Enrichment, Visual and Performing Arts, and Mental and Physical Health.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Camps</emph></p>
            <p>Although eventually phased out, BCNY’s recreational camps featured preeminently among its early services. The first program of summer camping was developed by Trustee William Carey in the 1890’s, and in 1902 Camp Carey was built at Jamesport, Long Island. Camp Carey was renovated in 1918, and new camps were opened in 1924 (Camp Harriman, for seniors 17 years and older, on 4,400 acres in what is now Harriman State Park) and 1926 (Camp Tabor on Fishers Island, where boys served as golf caddies).</p>
            <p>By the 1950's, development was crowding the area around Camp Carey and camp attendance had begun to drop, in part due to racial tensions between a diversifying membership. In 1963, Camp Carey was sold, and the funds were used towards the purchase of a new Camp Harriman on land in the northeast corner of the Catskills. In 1980, BCNY sold Camp Harriman to the State of New York. Three years later, in 1983, it purchased Camp Northover, later renamed Camp Cromwell, in Bound Brook, New Jersey -- a location close enough to New York City to operate as a day camp. By 1985, Camp Cromwell became the site of BCNY's Summer School.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Organization and administration</emph></p>
            <p>At first Harriman and his friends took turns coming to the clubhouse after business hours to spend time with the boys and supervise their activities. As regular attendance grew, a more formal organizational structure was created, with a Board of Directors and an Executive Committee that took care of BCNY's everyday affairs. Both were headed by Harriman. Annual operating expenses were covered by contributions from Mr. Harriman and friends including William Carey, Sherman Evarts, Walter Jennings, Nathaniel C. Fisher, William R. Barbour, and Henry Stanford Brooks, Jr.</p>
            <p>On March 24, 1887, BCNY was incorporated and a 15-member Board of Trustees was elected, with Harriman serving as President. After E.H. Harriman died in 1909, Temple Bowdoin became the second president of BCNY, serving until his untimely death at age 51 in 1914. Succeeding him as President were Charles Sabin (1915-1934), E.Roland Harriman (1934-1957), Frederick Pratt (1957-1966), Minot K. Milliken (1966-1986), Carroll L. Wainwright (1986-1994), and Silas R. Anthony, Jr. (1996-2014).</p>
            <p>In the 1920's, the Trustees created a new organizational structure, dividing their work into six departments: physical, entertainments, educational, building and equipment, camp and publicity. In April 1927, in anticipation of opening the new Jefferson Park branch, the Board established an Endowment Committee to raise sufficient funds to operate two facilities. BCNY's endowment program had begun in 1909, with a $50,000 contribution from Emma Cummins, the widow of Lorenzo G. Woodhouse, a partner in Chicago's Marshall Field Department Store. E. Roland Harriman, the son of founder E.H. Harriman, became the Club's first chairman of the board in 1957.</p>
            <p>In 1934, a Women's Division was founded to help the Board of Trustees raise money and increase publicity. The following year, the Women's Division sponsored a Gay Thirties dinner dance, which was to become the annual spring benefit. By 1938, the Women's Division had established committees dealing with a variety of activities, including dramatics, junior achievement, and theater benefits. It was not until 1968, however, that the Women's Board was formally established. In addition to sponsoring the annual spring and fall benefits (the latter instituted in 1949), along with other fund raising events, Women's Board members instituted and contribute to "Homework Help," a volunteer after-school tutoring program. In 1989, women were included on the Board of Trustees for the first time.</p>
            <p>In addition to the fund-raising events sponsored by the Women's Board, the Club instituted in 1976 -- the year of the Club's 100th anniversary -- its most successful annual fundraiser: the All Sports Hall of Fame Dinner. It is generally held in the late fall, and honors the year's Hall of Fame inductees for each of six sports -- baseball, basketball, football, golf, hockey and tennis.</p>
            <p>As the Board of Trustees expanded to meet the challenges of running the organization, BCNY also began building a professional staff to manage the day-to-day operations of the clubhouses and programs. The first paid professional staff, Francis Hebard Tabor, was hired as superintendent in 1898. Under Tabor's leadership, numerous athletic and other activities were instituted and BCNY's fundamental organizational system took shape. In 1911, Tabor resigned to found St. Bernard's School for Boys in Manhattan, and in 1912 Louis DeForest Downer joined BCNY as superintendent, later serving as director and managing director until 1937.</p>
            <p>In 1939, around the same time that it was expanding its operations, BCNY consolidated its administration under the leadership of Peter Capra, who served as Executive Director from 1939 to 1962. Soon after his appointment, the board was reorganized into seven working committees -- Special Givers, Law and Trust Companies, Lists, Steering, Publicity, Special Events and Letters and Appeals -- to support the work of the board's Executive Committee, which in effect ran the Club. When Capra, ill with Parkinson's disease, stepped down in 1962, he was succeeded by Robert T. Olson (Executive Director 1962-1989). Olson was replaced in 1989 by his assistant Executive Director, Martin Bunce.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">Alumni association</emph></p>
            <p>In 1928, a group of alumni founded the Alumni Association to "assist the Boys' Club Trustees in the successful management of the Club." Open to all former BCNY members, the Alumni Association contributed both funds and volunteer services to current BCNY members. George Flatow, one of the founding members, was appointed chairman; his reminiscences and scrapbooks are included in the collection. After WWII, returning vets contributed to the growth of a strong, active Alumni Association. In 1947, the Jefferson Park clubhouse established its own alumni association.</p>

                            <p>Board of Trustee meeting minutes are complete for the period from 1930 to 2015. Although there are no minutes for Board of Trustee meetings held prior to 1930, there are minutes of the Executive Committee meetings dating back to 1917 (see Subseries I.3, below).</p>
                            <p>Minutes typically list meeting attendees and discuss nomination and elections of new members, obituaries and memorials for deceased members, and reports of the various board committees. Financial and operational matters are also frequently included, particularly matters relating to the various clubhouses and camps. There are some interesting references to membership issues, including ethnic and racial tensions and the changing demographics of the clubhouse neighborhoods, particularly in the 1950's and 1960's. There are also reports on clubhouse activities and special events. A list of "important items mentioned in Trustee minutes" through 1984, compiled by BCNY, is included in Box 6, Folder 6.</p>
                            <p>There is some duplication of records in the Board of Trustee minutes, reflecting their original arrangement. In some instances (for example, in the 1940's), Executive Committee Minutes are included with board minutes.</p>
                            <p>Note that access to Board of Trustee meeting minutes is restricted for 35 years from the date of creation. Materials that were subject to restriction at the time this finding aid was created are identified in the box and folder list.</p>

                        <p>This subseries includes minutes of Board Committee meetings as well as committee files with drafts, memoranda and correspondence relating to issues discussed at meetings.</p>
                        <p>The Executive Committee was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the organization. The Committee met monthly and made recommendations to the Board of Trustees on major issues facing the organization. Minutes often include more detailed discussions of issues that are subsequently addressed in meetings of the Board of Trustees. They generally include summary reports from the other Board committees and from various members of the executive staff. Topics include budgetary and financial issues, clubhouse activities, building operations, expansion and divestments, camps, membership, events, and virtually every other aspect of BCNY administration.</p>
                        <p>In 1916, a Ways and Means Committee was created to relieve BCNY's treasurer of sole responsibility for collecting current funds. In the early years, the Ways and Means Committee often met jointly with the Executive Committee, and minutes of its meetings are included with the Executive Committee minutes.</p>
                        <p>The Administration Committee was formed in the early 1950's to provide coordination and oversight of the activities of the other committees, and to focus on long-term planning. Since the Administration Committee also assumed responsibility for oversight of executive operations, these files are a good source of information about personnel issues.</p>
                        <p>The Finance Committee had responsibility for investments of funds. Minutes discuss fund performance, investment strategies, and related issues. Financial statements are frequently attached.</p>
                        <p>The Education Committee files are concerned with BCNY's program to place members in private preparatory schools and colleges. This program was established in 1952 with money donated by trustee Victor Morawetz. Minutes discuss scholarships, IQ testing, selection of schools, and the performance of participants. There is also discussion of the placement of "Negro" boys.</p>
                        <p>The Evaluation Committee was formed to assess the programs and activities of BCNY in the 1970's. Files include memoranda assessing BCNY's overall goals and challenges, which provide a detailed and interesting snapshot of the organization in the early 1970's.</p>
                        <p>The Building Committees were responsible for supervising the activities and expenditures of their respective clubhouses. Files include descriptive information about the activities of both members and staff. There is also statistical information about membership and participation in programs, and analysis of the effects of ethnic, racial and social trends. There is some financial and budgetary information about the buildings as well.</p>
                        <p>Note that access to Committee meeting minutes is restricted for 35 years from the date of creation. Materials that were subject to restriction at the time this finding aid was created are noted in the box and folder list.</p>

                        <p>The Women's Board was established in 1968. Its purpose was initially limited to managing BCNY's fund raising benefits, but eventually expanded to include administering volunteer programs such as Homework Help and R.E.A.D. Minutes date back to 1973 and are primarily concerned with planning of events, including Spring and Fall Dances, fashion shows, and movie and theater benefits. There is also some correspondence relating to meetings, events and volunteer programs, along with some financial statements.</p>
                        <p>Women became eligible to serve on the Board of Trustees in 1989, and minutes and correspondence from the late 1980's include discussion of this issue.</p>
                        <p>Note that access to Women's Board meeting minutes and related correspondence is restricted for 35 years from the date of creation. Materials that were subject to restriction at the time this finding aid was created are identified in the box and folder list.</p>

                        <p>This subseries contains materials on various programs instituted by BCNY to serve their membership. It includes correspondence and ephemera relating to Athletic Program events, including two trans-Atlantic amateur boxing matches against the London Federation of Boys' Clubs in the 1950's; documents relating to BCNY's jobs program; documents relating to Saturday programming at the clubhouses; and applications for and descriptions of various programs aimed at promoting health and good character.</p>
                        <p>There are also several folders of material (primarily memos and correspondence) regarding BCNY's "Group Club" program, which continues the approach introduced by first Superintendent Frances Tabor of organizing boys into small groups or "clubs" headed by a staff member or volunteer group leader. Group leaders are typically successful businessmen who serve as role models and mentors, including many BCNY trustees.</p>

                        <p>Spanning the period from 1890 to 2003, the Annual Reports provide an excellent overview of BCNY's activities and philosophy and the organization's evolution over time. They are also a rich source of information about the neighborhoods in which BCNY operated (the East Village, the Lower East Side, and Harlem), and about the economic and social conditions of the times. For example, the 1917 Annual Report includes a photograph of a minstrel show performed by the boys; the 1925 Annual Report is titled "A Flame Beneath the Melting Pot;" and the 1941-1942 Annual Report focuses on "Training for Service" and "Men of the Post-War World." Beginning in 1907, reports are illustrated with photographs depicting clubhouse and camp activities and, occasionally, neighborhood scenes. Annual reports also reflect the evolution of social work in America.</p>

                        <p>This subseries consists of pamphlets and newsletters issued by BCNY, the former to solicit funds and volunteers, and the latter to highlight current programs and the achievements of individual members and staff. Pamphlets include images and many summarize BCNY's achievements, providing capsule histories of the organization. Like the Annual Reports, they are also a good source of information about economic and social trends.</p>

                    <p>The Alumni Association was formed in 1928 to "assist the Boys' Club Trustees in the successful management of the Club." Open to all former BCNY members, the Alumni Association contributed both funds and volunteer services to current BCNY members. Papers include meeting minutes, correspondence, newsletters, event programs, and other material relating to the activities of the Alumni Association.</p>
                    <p>Also included are the reminiscences and scrapbooks of George Flatow, an early Club member and one of the founding members of the Alumni Association. Flatow wrote detailed descriptions of and anecdotes from BCNY's early days, and also profiled club members from that era, describing their contributions to the club as well as their subsequent careers. Notable examples include soccer star Nathan Agar; Aaron Chwatt, better known as comedian and actor "Red Buttons;" racecar champion Ralph DePalma; and vaudeville comedian Edward Hastings Ford. While they are personal recollections, rather than a reliable factual record, Flatow's writings offer a unique perspective on the Club's early history and on the experience of urban life in early twentieth century New York City.</p>

                    <p>The many photographs in this collection provide a rich visual record of the activities and people associated with BCNY. Photographs span the period from the 1890's to 2000's. Although most photographs are undated, it appears that the 1940's and 1950's are especially well documented.</p>
                    <p>Photographs are generally arranged by subject, including: neighborhood scenes; clubhouse buildings; sports (including team shots as well as game and action shots); recreational activities such as art, photography, glee club and many others; camp photographs; program activities (primarily educational); theatrical productions; pictures and portraits of officers, alumni and boys; and photographs of various fund-raising events (note that photographs of the All-Star Annual Hall of Fame event are housed separately in Series VI, Benefit events).</p>
                    <p>In some cases, photographs by identified photographers are arranged by the name of the photographer. There are many photographs by Sam Reiss (1910-1975), better known for his photography of the labor movement in New York City; other photographers include Paul Parker, Heini Mayr, and Dick Meek. The majority of the photographs, however, are by unidentified photographers.</p>
                    <p>Oversize photographs are listed at the end of the Series and include photographs from most or all of the categories listed above. The series also includes photo albums and photographic slides of various subjects (identified in the box and folder list) as well as negatives (largely unidentified). The same subject may appear in different formats (for example, camp photos will be found in loose photographs, photo albums, oversize photographs, and photographic slides), so in order to locate all the relevant visual material, researchers should search or browse the entire box and folder list for Series VII.</p>
                    <p>Photographs that were exhibited at BCNY have been unframed and are housed together as "Display photos" (Box 115, Folders 3-8).</p>
                    <p>Note that some photographs have numbers on the back preceded by "BD", "CP", or "HP"; captions for these photographs will be found in Box 115.</p>

                    <p>This series consists of scrapbooks and loose ephemera which provide a colorful glimpse of historical activities at BCNY.</p>
                    <p>Scrapbooks include publicity scrapbooks (containing news clippings and advertisements relating to various benefit events); golf scrapbooks (containing news clippings relating to golf benefits); other scrapbooks of news clippings (containing clippings regarding BCNY activities and people associated with the organization); an Education Program scrapbook (containing photographic portraits of scholarship recipients and related materials); and scrapbooks from trips made by BCNY athletic teams to China (in 1999) and Cuba (in 2001).</p>
                    <p>Loose ephemera includes postcards, programs and invitations (including many from BCNY theatrical productions), fliers, stationary, certificates, and various other "throwaway" or souvenir items. There are also objects such as athletic medals, printing blocks of BCNY logos, t-shirts, and two vinyl records. In addition, there are items created by the boys (essays and a few pieces of artwork). Items of particular interest are highlighted in the box and folder list.</p>
                    <p>Also included in this series are information cards identifying early "club leaders" and volunteers, and early membership registers and guest books.</p>
