            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Terence Sellers was born to Robert and Gloria Sellers in Washington DC. From 1970-1973 she attended St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico in the Classical Studies department but did not complete her degree. She earned a BA in forensic psychology at John Jay College in New York City in 1986.</p>
            <p>In 1973 Sellers moved to New York City intending to pursue a career in writing and dance. Shortly after moving to New York she formed friendships with artists and writers including Anya Phillips, Kathy Acker, Duncan Smith, Victor Bockris, Carl Apfelschnitt, Jimmy De Sana and Duncan Hannah, many of which resulted in collaborations. For example, Sellers and Hannah worked on several projects together, including Amos Poe's 1978 film 
                <emph render="italic">The Foreigner</emph>. Around the same time Sellers worked with photographer Jimmy De Sana on a series of 32 photographs entitled "The Dungeon Series". The original intent of the project was to use the photographs in Sellers' then unpublished work 
                <emph render="italic">The Correct Sadist</emph>. However, after the work was complete De Sana and William S. Burroughs used the photographs to illustrate their own book project, 
                <emph render="italic">Submission</emph>.</p>
            <p>As a prolific writer, Sellers kept daily journals, maintained close correspondence with friends, family and colleagues, wrote a large volume of short stories and worked on several manuscripts. She was an early contributor to 
                <emph render="italic">BOMB Magazine</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">X Magazine</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Vacation</emph> and other publications devoted to New York's Downtown art, music, film and literary scene.</p>
            <p>Most of Sellers' writing is on the subject of sadomasochism. While her work as a professional dominatrix and her fascination with violence, self-punishment, the occult, and psychoanalysis has given shape to much of her writing, her literary influences include Baudelaire, Dostoevsky, and the French surrealists.</p>
            <p>Sellers' most famous work is a novel called the 
                <emph render="italic">The Correct Sadist: The Memoirs of Angel Stern</emph>. It is written as a collection of short "case studies" relating to themes of sexual dominance and submission, bondage and discipline, and fetishism. Originally published by iKoo-Buchverlg in Berlin in 1981 as 
                <emph render="italic">Der korrekte Sadismus</emph>, Sellers self-published the work in English under Vitriol Publications in 1983. In 1985, Grove Press contracted the novel and Barney Rosset handled its publication. It is also published in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Sellers' other published novels include 
                <emph render="italic">The Obsession</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">Dungeon Evidence: The Correct Sadist II</emph>. Excerpts from other manuscripts such as 
                <emph render="italic">The Degenerate</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Most Ill of All</emph> and 
                <emph render="italic">One Decadent Life</emph> have appeared in a wide range of publications in several languages. Sellers participated in events such as The Times Square Show (1980) and has read her work throughout the US, Europe and Canada. Although Sellers did not achieve the name recognition and literary success of some of her contemporaries, she is an important and influential member of the Downtown scene.</p>

                    <p>Series IV: Writings is divided into five subseries according to genre. Subseries A contains Sellers' short stories, poems and plays, organized alphabetically. Subseries B includes Sellers' novels, organized alphabetically by title. These materials also include research for each project including notes, manuscripts, drafts, proofs, and promotion and publication materials. Subseries C contains original artwork by Jeffrey Bretschneider and Carl Apfelschnitt that was produced to illustrate editions of her published work. Subseries D is a scrapbook that Sellers created of clippings from magazines and newspapers relating to her life and literary career. Subseries E includes copies of Sellers' published essays and prose works, including various editions of works. Original folders are also included with most of the work in this series because in many instances Sellers took notes and brainstormed on her original folders. All work is arranged alphabetically by project.</p>
