            <abstract id="ref1975" label="Abstract">Estela Bravo is an American-born documentary filmmaker whose award-winning films focus on Latin America, and especially Cuba, where she has lived since the early 1960s. Bravo’s bi-cultural perspective informs her work, as do her progressive political convictions and humanist philosophy. This collection includes 1,365 videotapes ( Umatic and Betacam format), along with a number of films on DVD and on 16mm and 35mm reels. Almost all of Bravo’s documentaries are represented in the collection, although for some there may be only a copy of the feature film or a small number of film clips. The documentary 
                <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> has the largest presence and its interviews are a highlight, with such figures as Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, Alice Walker, Philip Agee, Edward Heath, George McGovern, Ted Turner, and others, including many well-known Cuban revolutionary fighters and government officials, as well as counterrevolutionaries such as the notorious Orlando Bosch. Other films, such as 
                <emph render="italic">The Cuban Excludables</emph>, 
                <emph render="italic">Miami-Havana</emph>, and 
                <emph render="italic">Americans in Cuba</emph>, also have significant representation within the collection. Because all of the materials arrived with serious condition issues, the process of mold remediation, repair, and digitization has been initiated and is ongoing. Only a portion of the footage is currently viewable. In addition to access copies of the digitized video, a selection of interviews may be seen, along with transcripts, on NYU’s Bravo Collection website.</abstract>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Estela and Ernesto Bravo Collection contains full-length features and film footage from documentaries directed by Estela Bravo over the past thirty-five years. A total of 1,365 videotapes (U-Matic and Betacam format), along with a number of films on DVD and on 16mm and 35mm reels, have been donated by the Bravos.</p>
            <p>Estela Bravo’s body of work is focused on the human consequences of historical events and on attempts at achieving social justice throughout Latin America, Africa, the Caribbean and the United States. Many of her films tell the story of Cuba since the Revolution and its relationship with the United States and with other countries; she also documents the tragedy of the missing children from Argentina’s “dirty war;” abuses inflicted by the Pinochet regime in Chile; the assassination of Maurice Bishop in Grenada; poverty and hunger resulting from Latin American debt: and the struggles to end apartheid in South Africa. Some of the films are of historic cultural events such as 
                <emph render="italic">Silvio and Pablo in Argentina</emph> (1984), which shares a massive concert held in Buenos Aires at the end of the military dictatorship, featuring two of Cuba’s most popular musicians, Silvio Rodriguez and Pablo Milanes, performing songs that had previously been forbidden in Argentina.</p>
            <p>Not all of Bravo’s films are represented within the collection. For some of the documentaries, there is only a copy of the feature-length film, and, for others, only film clips. The most extensive representation is from 
                <emph render="italic">Fidel The Untold Story </emph>(and the follow-on film, 
                <emph render="italic">Anecdotes about Fidel</emph>). There are more than four hundred pieces of footage as well as copies of the films themselves. Among the highlights of this material are interviews with such notable individuals as Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, George McGovern, Alice Walker, Harry Belafonte, Philip Agee, Ted Turner, Edward Heath, Jorge Risquet, Ricardo Alarcon, Vilma Espin, Angela Davis, and many others, including counterrevolutionaries such as the notorious Orlando Bosch.</p>
            <p>Other films that have a strong presence in the collection are 
                <emph render="italic">Americans in Cuba</emph>, personal stories of individuals who came to Cuba and have made their lives there; 
                <emph render="italic">The Cuban Excludables</emph>, which reveals the plight of many Cubans who came to the US during the Mariel boatlift and who were indefinitely detained in harsh and abusive conditions; and 
                <emph render="italic">Miami-Havana</emph>, a film that illustrates the tragic consequences of restrictions on travel and communication between Cuba and the US.</p>
            <p>In addition to Bravo documentaries, there is footage that was not included in any feature film. It may have been shot with a potential film in mind, or just because an interesting event was occurring or someone important was available to speak with the Bravos. For example, there is an interview with Mikis Theodrakis, a Greek songwriter/composer and opponent of repressive Greek regimes. Theodrakis is a longtime supporter of Cuba and of Fidel Castro. There is footage from Brazil, including an interview with Luis Carlos Prestes (1898-1990) who was a Brazilian revolutionary and leader in the Brazilian Communist Party.</p>
            <p>Although a large part of the collection consists of interviews, there are also scenes of important events, marches, demonstrations, and performances; battle footage; historical clips from Cuba’s State Council archives; speeches by Fidel Castro, Nelson Mandela, and others; and a good deal of background footage (b-roll) used in the finished films. Some of the material may be seen in more than one documentary, as older clips often provide background and context for a subsequent film. A good example is the use of footage from the 1985 film, 
                <emph render="italic">Missing Children</emph>, in the 2007 documentary, 
                <emph render="italic">Who Am I? The Found Children of Argentina</emph>.</p>
            <p>Because almost all of the videotapes arrived at the Library in very poor condition (mold, binder hydrolysis, brittle or broken tape), viewing of the footage has only been possible once a video has been remediated/repaired and digitized. This process is ongoing, with just over 270 pieces of film currently viewable and accessible to researchers.</p>
            <p>All of the currently digitized material is described in the finding aid; adding entries for video not yet digitized is underway and will continue until all items are listed. Determining context and content has been based on box and reel annotations; viewing of full-length films to identify events, individuals and locations; historical research; and input from Estela and Ernesto Bravo. The descriptions of videos that have not yet been digitized will often contain phrases in quotation marks. These are the annotations copied from the original cassette boxes and are often the only clues to the content at this time. As digitized versions become available, more accurate descriptions will be possible. Footage that has not yet been associated with a specific feature film may be found in the collection’s final series. It should be noted that most of the footage is undated; specific dates are listed if they appeared on the cassette annotations or were inferred from the film's content.</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="bold">A group of digitized interviews has been selected and made accessible on NYU’s Bravo Collection website ( ). There are also transcripts in Spanish and English. The presence of online copies is noted in the descriptive information for each entry. Digitized material not available online may be viewed in Tamiment Library’s reading room. </emph></p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Estela Bravo (1933- ) is an American-born documentary filmmaker whose award-winning films focus on Latin America, and especially Cuba, where she has lived with her husband, Ernesto Mario Bravo, since the early 1960s. This unique bi-cultural experience informs, enriches, and distinguishes her films. Gary Crowdus, founder and editor of 
                <emph render="italic">Cineaste</emph> magazine characterized her as "both an American, one whose progressive political convictions and humanist sentiments were formed during the anticommunist hysteria which gripped the US in the Fifties, and as an assimilated Latin Americanist who has lived in Cuba for decades." Described as a sensitive filmmaker and skilled interviewer, Bravo finds the essence of social problems and political issues by talking with individuals directly involved, and is often able to elicit their innermost feelings. The films reflect compassion, empathy, and a sincere desire to reveal the human drama behind the larger events of the day.</p>
            <p>Bravo's documentaries have been shown throughout Latin America and around the world, at international film festivals, and at retrospectives honoring her work. Her films have also been viewed on PBS (US), CBC (Canada), Channel 4 (UK) Canal Plus (France) and on many other television networks.</p>
            <p>Born in Brooklyn on June 8, 1933, Estela Bravo is the youngest of three daughters from a working class family of European immigrants. Her mother died when she was only 12. Her father, Phillip Segall, was a Union man whose ideas influenced her greatly. Estela worked for the Furriers Union while studying sociology at night at Brooklyn College. She helped organize a group called Students for a Peaceful World and, in 1953, as their representative, attended the 3rd World Student Congress in Warsaw, Poland, where she met Ernesto. They married in January of 1956 and for several years she worked in Argentina as a teacher and, later, for an airline company. When, in 1963, Ernesto was asked to join the faculty of the Medical School of the University of Havana, the Bravos moved to Cuba. There, she worked at the cultural institution Casa de las Americas where she was involved in programs centering on folk and protest music, and, at the same time, earned a degree in History from Havana University. Estela moved on to developing children's television programs and creating short documentaries based on archival footage dealing with such figures as the Rosenbergs, Malcolm X, and Paul Robeson. (The scripts were written by Ernesto.) In 1980, Estela Bravo completed her first major documentary, 
                <emph render="italic">Those Who Left</emph>, the story of Cubans who left the island after the triumph of the Revolution. Films she has made since that time are listed in the Filmography below.</p>
            <p>Ernesto Mario Bravo (1929- ) was born in Argentina on April 7,1929. In 1951, while a University student in Buenos Aires, he was abducted from his home by Peronist police, held and cruelly tortured for twenty days before being released, in part because of a massive student protest and strike. When Ernesto and Estela met, he was still recovering from his injuries. Having received a PhD in Chemistry from the University of Buenos Aries, Ernesto was asked to teach Biochemistry at the Medical School of the University of Havana. In addition to his teaching career, Ernesto has written a number of books, including 
                <emph render="italic">Modern Medicine in Cuba</emph> (1995) and 
                <emph render="italic">Development within Underdevelopment: New Trends in Cuban Medicine</emph> (1998). He has also been a collaborator with his wife on her many documentary films.</p>
            <p>Estela and Ernesto Bravo continue to make films and to travel the world. In 2014, they were honored in South Africa by the Mandela Foundation, made several trips to Argentina, visited their three children and grandchildren in the US, and released films about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Commander Juan Almeida, along with an update to their 2007 film,

            <p>A number of films in this collection have been digitized. Researchers must use access DVDs to view this material. Existence of access copies is indicated in the descriptive information for each individual recording. Additional information about material that has not been digitized may also be found at the entry level. Please contact the library to determine if films in this collection have been digitized and are ready for immediate use.</p>
            <p>Researchers interested in using materials that have not been digitized must request an access copy. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of a visit. Films in this collection are in extremely poor condition, and researchers are limited to 5 digitization requests per year.

            <head>Processing Information Note</head>
            <p>Upon receipt of this collection, Tamiment Library discovered that a large number of films were mold infested, and separated these materials for immediate stabilization and preservation treatment. Subsequent assessments revealed mold in more of the videos, as well as binder hydrolysis and other condition issues, making it impossible to view any of the original film footage. Working with the Preservation Department and several vendors specializing in remediation of digital media, the process of repair and digitization was initiated and is ongoing.</p>
            <p>Film footage in this collection has been associated with the full-length feature in which it appears. In the containers that arrived from Cuba, there were packing slips that roughly listed feature films with which each box's contents were associated; however, the immediate removal of many of the seriously moldy films meant separation from this limited information. The cassette cases and/or the cassettes themselves, were sometimes annotated with the film name or had some other annotations suggesting film or footage content. A few had small handwritten notes inside.</p>
            <p>Much of the information concerning specific footage content and associated feature film(s) has been reconstructed to the best of the archivist's ability through analysis of container annotations, research, and consultation with the donors. Material has been incorporated into the series that best represents the context of its use. (Note that some of the footage may relate to other series or be represented in multiple full-length feature films in this collection.) The descriptions of video cassettes that have not yet been digitized will often contain phrases in quotation marks. These are the annotations taken from the cassette boxes. As digitized versions of the videos become available, descriptions are being updated.</p>

                    <p>After the Cuban Revolution, some Americans remained in Cuba; others came afterwards for various reasons and decided to stay. Among them were the following:</p>
                    <p>Elfriede Mahler (1917-1998), an American dancer who arrived in Havana in the summer of 1960 and remained. She spent much of her life in Guantanamo, founding the province’s first professional dance company, Danza Libre.</p>
                    <p>Marjorie Moore (1920-2003) was born in the US and studied at Columbia University. In 1946, she married a Cuban named Luis Rios and, they moved to Cuba with their daughter Pamela in 1950. She remained in Cuba for the rest of her life. She was a teacher, headed a brigade of teachers in Cuba’s Literacy Campaign and, in 1962, joined the English Department of what is now the Medical University of Havana. She is most known for her work in English for Medicine.</p>
                    <p>Lorna Burdsall (1928-2010), came to Cuba in 1955 as the wife of a Cuban revolutionary. Ms. Burdsall was raised in New London, Connecticut and trained with Martha Graham and studied dance at the Julliard School. In 1953 she met a young Cuban, Manuel Pineiro, who was studying business administration at Columbia. They married in New York but he left for Cuba to join Castro’s forces shortly after their wedding. She joined him in 1955 and lived in Cuba for the rest of her life. Burdsall taught at the National Dance School and was a founding member of Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna, which she eventually directed. Burdsall was with the company for nearly 20 years, and created numerous works reflecting the spirit of the Cuban people. In 1977 she became the national director of dance and modern dance advisor to the Minister of Culture. She mentored and inspired generations of Cuban dancers and brought influences from Western dance that have since been taught to many young Cubans.</p>

                    <p>In October 1975, South Africa invaded Angola intending to defeat the leftwing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and could have succeeded had not 36,000 Cuban soldiers poured into Angola. For 13 years, Cubans and Angolans fought side by side against South African forces. In addition, the Cubans trained African National Congress (ANC) guerrillas and rebels fighting for Namibian independence against the occupying South Africans. After a decisive battle at Cuito Cuanavale (1988), Pretoria accepted Cuban demands and withdrew unconditionally from Angola and agreed to UN supervised elections in Namibia. Fidel Castro’s commitment to the struggle against apartheid was one of the underlying motivations for his intervention in Angola. Nelson Mandela later said that the Cuban victory “destroyed the myth of the invincibility of the white oppressor… [and] inspired the fighting masses of South Africa… Cuito Cuanavale was the turning point for the liberation of our continent – and of my people – from the scourge of apartheid.”</p>

                    <p>More than 125,000 Cubans left the fishing port of Mariel in 1980 bound for the United States. A number of them were prison inmates or mental patients who had been released to join the boat lift. Although some were held for having committed serious crimes, and not released, many were eventually freed. But any of the Mariel Cubans who committed a crime once in the US were immediately returned to INS custody after they served jail or prison sentences. Many had been picked up on petty offenses such as shoplifting, drunk driving, or marijuana possession. The US contended that any Cuban refugee who had not become a citizen or legal resident could be detained indefinitely after completing a jail term for even the smallest crime. The lack of normal relations with Cuba made it impossible to send them back.</p>
                    <p>US District Judge Marvin Shoob in Atlanta ruled in 1983 that this detention was unconstitutional, but a panel of appellate judges overturned his decision. Shoob, in an unusual posture for a federal judge, spoke out in favor of the detainees and disagreed with the assumption that they were all violent criminals.</p>
                    <p>In an agreement signed in 1984, Cuba consented to the return of about 2,500 detainees but the deportations were cut short because of broadcasts by US government-sponsored Radio Marti into Cuba. Riots in 1987 at prisons in Georgia and Louisiana led to the renewal of the deportation agreement and a promise of hearings for the detainees. Attorneys for the Cubans, however, were not allowed to call witnesses, to cross-examine adverse evidence, or to see the full contents of their clients’ files. The hearing process could take many years and the Cubans were being held in conditions considered deplorable by national and international human rights groups. In addition, many of the Cubans who were eventually deported were forced to leave American families behind. This was the situation at the time the Bravos filmed

                    <p>Though flawed, the review panels did eventually free many of the prisoners. In 2005, twenty-five years after the Cubans left Mariel, the US Supreme Court ruled that open-ended detention of Mariel Cubans was illegal. At that time there were 750 still in detention.</p>

                    <p>In addition to a copy of the full-length feature, the series footage includes interviews with a variety of individuals including US District Judge Marvin Shoob; Wayne Smith, former head the US Interests Section in Havana; and Dennis (Denny) McLain, a former American baseball player who was convicted of embezzlement and spent time in prison with the Cuban detainees. Other interviewees include lawyers and human rights activists, INS and Coast Guard employees; correctional officers and other prison staff, and the detainees themselves, along with family members. Of particular interest are interviews with Dr. Bolivar Martineau, deputy warden and chief medical officer at the Atlanta Penitentiary. Martineau was accused by prisoners and staff of physical abuse, including using Thorazine and Haldol to control the detainees and conducting experiments on them with various drugs.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the interviews, there are news clips, footage from the prisons, interviews with the American families of some of the detainees, and scenes from Cuba, as the detainees arrived home and were reunited with their Cuban families. Some of the material is duplicative and there are background visuals and many shots of leaving and arriving planes.</p>
                    <p>Note that the interviews with Bolivar Martineau and Denny McLain were arranged and funded by 5th Estate Canadian Broadcasting System who used the footage for a period of time and then turned it over to the Bravos for their film.</p>

                        <p>Dennis Dale "Denny" McLain (1944- ) is an American former professional baseball player. He played major league ball for ten seasons, much of that time with the Detroit Tigers. His early career was very successful but he was a controversial player, often brash and outspoken. He became involved with organized crime and was convicted on embezzlement charges. He served time at the same prison and at the same time as many of the Cuban detainees.</p>

                        <p>Marvin Herman Shoob (1923- ) is a US Federal Judge who was nominated by Jimmy Carter in 1979 to the US District Court, Northern District of Georgia. He assumed senior status in 1991.</p>
                        <p>Shoob served in the US military from 1942-1945 as an Army sergeant, received his law degree from the University of Georgia School of Law in 1948, and was in private practice in Atlanta from 1948-1979.</p>
                        <p>Judge Shoob, in 1983, ruled that the indefinite detention of the Cuban Excludables was unconstitutional but his ruling was subsequently overturned by appellate judges.</p>

                        <p>Most of the footage involves interviews with returned detainees and their families; discussion of the Marielitos. At around 54 minutes, there is a brief clip of Martineau, then at 57 minutes, discussion with someone who worked at the prison with Martineau. There is a brief moment of discussion with Denny McLain but with Spanish voiceover, and then a few more minutes with Martineau.</p>
                        <p>Note that the interviews with McLain and Martineau were funded by The Fifth Estate (Canadian Broadcasting System television investigative documentary program). They used the footage and then returned it to the Bravos for their film.</p>

                    <p>The 2001 documentary 
                        <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> combines a history of the Cuban revolution with a more personal story of its leader, Fidel Castro. Footage from the Cuban State Council Archives and various news sources, as well as exclusive interviews with historians, public figures, close friends, and with Castro himself, provide a glimpse into the life and personality of the charismatic Cuban leader. Interviewees such as Alice Walker, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Arthur Schlesinger, Ramsey Clark, Ted Turner, Nelson Mandela, Charles Rangel, George McGovern, Philip Agee, and many others share personal anecdotes along with political and historical perspectives.</p>
                    <p>Because so much of the interview footage for 
                        <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story</emph> could not be included in the initial feature-length film, the Bravos decided, in 2009, that they should make another film. 
                        <emph render="italic">Anecdotes about Fidel</emph> incudes portions of twenty-four interviews and expands on the stories about Fidel. The anecdotes come not only from well-known Americans such as Harry Belafonte, Jesse Jackson, Angela Davis, Hank Aaron, Sydney Pollak and others, but also from many Cubans who are not so well known in the US. Among them are government officials and friends of Fidel such as Juan Almeida, Melba Hernandez. Alfredo Guevara, Jorge Risquet, Antonio Nunez Jimenez, Alicia Alonso, Angela Castro, and Aleida Guevara.</p>
                    <p>This series contains copies of both films. It includes not only complete interviews and portions of interviews highlighted in the two films, but also interviews that are not seen in the films. Examples include an interview with Hortensia Bussi de Allende, the widow of Salvador Allende and one with American lawyer Victor Rabinowitz.</p>
                    <p>In 2001, 
                        <emph render="italic">Fidel: The Untold Story </emph>was selected for the Toronto Film Festival and won an award for "Distinguished Achievement for Excellence in Documentary Filmmaking" at the Urbanworld Film Festival, New York.</p>
                    <p>Note about State Council footage: The clips in each piece of footage often represent a wide date range. Some of the footage is dated '1998' which reflects the date the material was obtained, not the actual date of the events. The actual dates are not recorded.</p>

                        <p>Born into humble circumstances in 1934, Henry Louis (Hank) Aaron worked his way through the ranks of the Negro Leagues to become one of the greatest Major League Baseball players of all time. He played as an outfielder for the Atlanta Braves for almost 23 years, during which time he broke many of baseball's most distinguished records, including most career home runs (755) -- a record that had stood for more than two decades. He was elected to baseball's Hall of Fame in 1982 and, in 2002, he was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>

The only Afro-Cuban to participate in the attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953, Almeida was later among the small group (16 out of 82) to survive the initial battle after the landing of the Granma in 1956 and go into the mountains. He then commanded the Third Front. During the US-sponsored Bay of Pigs operation in April 1961, Almeida commanded the Cuban military’s Central Army. Later a prominent figure in the Communist Party of Cuba, Almeida at the time of his death, was Vice-President of the Cuban Council of State and its third ranking member.</p>

                        <p>Francisco Gonzalez y Aruca (1941-2013) was a Cuban-American radio host and businessman. As a very young man, after the revolution, he joined Manuel Ray’s counterrevolutionary organization, Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo [MRP]. Arrested in 1961, he was sentenced by the Castro government to thirty years in prison. Aruca escaped from prison and reached Miami via Ecuador and Colombia. Aruca’s views on Castro softened with time. When the US government permitted family visits between Cuba and the United States in 1979, Aruca set up a company to provide travel services. He also began hosting a program on Miami's "Radio Progreso,” which The New York Times described in a 2006 profile of Aruca as an unusual “pro-Castro radio show” in South Florida.</p>

                        <p>Orlando Bosch Avila (1926-2011) was a Cuban-American pediatrician, violent extremist, and head of Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations [CORU], which in 1978 the FBI described as "an anti-Castro terrorist umbrella organization."</p>
                        <p>Bosch, who attended the University of Havana's medical school, interned at the University of Toledo in Ohio. After returning to Cuba, he opposed the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista and later supported Castro. By mid-1960, however, Bosch became disillusioned with the direction taken by the Cuban revolution and took his family to Miami.</p>
                        <p>In Miami, Orlando Bosch became a violent opponent of the Castro regime. In 1968 he was sentenced to 10 years in US federal prison for bombing ships engaged in trade with Cuba. After being paroled in 1972, he resumed terrorist attacks. The FBI noted that in June 1974 he admitted sending letter bombs to Cuban embassies in Canada, Peru, Spain and Argentina. After the bombing of a Cubana Airlines plane in 1976, in which 78 people died, Bosch was arrested and tried by the Venezuelan government and later acquitted. He, along with another exile leader, Luis Posada Carriles, was also suspected of involvement in the assassination of Chilean former minister Orlando Letelier in Washington, DC in 1976.</p>

                        <p>Peter G. Bourne (born 1939 in Oxford, England) is a physician, anthropologist, biographer, author and international civil servant. After graduating from medical school at Emory, he entered the US Army and, among other duties, spent a year in Vietnam. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Air Medal and the Combat Medics Badge. His various careers include serving in the administrations of both Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. In 1979, he became an Assistant Secretary-General at the United Nations, where he established and ran the "International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade," a 10-year program that would provide clean drinking water to more than 500 million people worldwide. After leaving the UN, in 1982 Bourne established an NGO, Global Water, to pursue the same goals as the UN program. He also began serving on the boards of numerous charities. Beginning in 1980 Bourne had been, on a part-time basis, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at St. George's University Medical School in Grenada, West Indies. In 1998 he moved to Grenada and became Vice Chancellor of the University. In 2003 Bourne left Grenada and returned to Washington, D.C. He was appointed as a Visiting Senior Research Fellow at Green Templeton College at the University of Oxford and began dividing his time between the US and the UK.</p>
                        <p>Building on a long standing interest in the Cuban health care system and relationships established during several visits to the country, Bourne published a well-received biography of Fidel Castro, 
                            <emph render="italic">Fidel - a biography of Fidel Castro</emph> in 1986. In 1995 as chairman of the American Association for World Health he directed a year-long foundation-supported study "Denial of Food and Medicine: The Impact of the US Embargo on Health and Nutrition in Cuba" that looked at humanitarian issues surrounding the US Embargo on Cuba. The study was translated into six languages and drew worldwide attention. It led to the establishment of the NGO, Medical Education Cooperation with Cuba (MEDICC) whose initial objective was to enable senior US medical students to spend six week electives with family doctors in Cuba. Over five years more than 1,500 students from virtually every medical school in the U.S. took advantage of this program. In 2004 Federal regulations with regard to Cuba were changed making impossible to continue this student program. MEDICC then began to focus on the production of a movie on the Cuban health system; the publication of a peer-reviewed, English language journal on Cuban health and medicine; and the recruitment of delegations of high level health policy makers to visit Cuba.</p>

                        <p>Carlos Alberto Libanio Christo, O.P. (1944), better known as Frei Betto, is a Brazilian writer, political activist, liberation theologist, and Dominican Friar. As a liberation theologist, he has been involved in various international efforts to support an understanding between Marxism and Christianity. During a visit to Havana in the 1980s, he held frequent and lengthy interviews with Fidel Castro and, subsequently, wrote the book, 
                            <emph render="italic">Fidel and Religion</emph>, which is said to have improved relations between Castro's government and the Catholic Church.</p>
                        <p>Frei Betto and Fidel Castro have remained friends and Betto is a frequent visitor to Havana.</p>
                        <p>In 2013, he was selected by UNESCO as the 2013 recipient of its International Jose Marti Prize for "his exceptional contribution to building a universal culture of peace, social justice and human rights in Latin America and the Caribbean." The prize was awarded in Havana on the 160th anniversary of Jose Marti's birth.</p>

                        <p>Vilma Lucila Espin Guillois (1930-2007) was a Cuban revolutionary, feminist, and chemical engineer. She participated in the Second Front, fighting in the Sierra Cristal during the Cuba Revolution. Marrying Raul Castro in 1959, she later became President of the Federation of Cuban Women and a member of the Council of State of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party. As a result of the secrecy surrounding Fidel Castro’s personal life, for decades Ms. Espin was considered Cuba’s First Lady. Espin and Raul Castro, who succeeded his brother as President of Cuba in 2008, had four children.</p>

                        <p>In 2000, a major controversy revolving around the custody and immigration status of a 6-year old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, involved the governments of the US and Cuba; Gonzalez's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez Quinanta; Gonzalez's other relatives in Miami and in Cuba; and Miami's Cuban American community.</p>
                        <p>Elian's mother, Elizabeth, drowned in November 1999 after leaving Cuba with her boyfriend and son in an attempt to reach the US. Initially, the US Immigration and Naturalization Service placed the boy with maternal relatives in Miami, who wanted to keep him in the US in opposition to his father who wanted him returned to Cuba. A ruling by the federal district court that only Elian's father could petition for asylum on the boy's behalf was upheld in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The US Supreme Court declined to hear the case. Because the Miami relatives continued to hold Elian, in defiance of court rulings, federal agents were ordered to seize the boy. In June of 2000, he returned to Cuba with his father.</p>

                        <p>Alfredo Guevara Valdes (1925-2013) was a lifelong friend of Fidel Castro. They were students at the University of Havana, where Guevara was a member of the Communist Youth organization. In 1947 Guevara and Castro ran against each other for secretary of the University’s Student Federation (FEU). Guevara won. After the Revolution, Guevara became vice minister of Culture and, at Castro’s request, established the Cuban Institute for Arts and Cinematography (I.C.A.I.C.), which sponsored Cuba's state-funded cinema. After leaving the ICAIC 1982, he spent nine years as Cuban ambassador to the United Nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (UNESCO). Having founded the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema in Havana in 1979, Guevara remained its president until his death.</p>

                        <p>Antonio Nunez Jimenez (1923-1998) was a Cuban revolutionary, academic, statesman and public figure. He was a captain who fought in the mountains alongside Che Guevara. After the revolution he was director of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform (INRA), which played a very significant role in the socialist transformation of Cuba. As Castro told the Soviets in 1960, INRA would achieve “the step-by-step elimination of property.” Nunez Jimeniz succeeded Che Guevara as president of the Cuban National Bank, and later was president of the Academy of Sciences, as well as serving for a time as Ambassador to Peru. Dr. Nunez Jimenez was one of Fidel Castro's closest friends.</p>

                        <p>Max Lesnick is a journalist and political activist who fought with Castro (his friend from college) in the Sierra Maestra. He hosted a Cuban radio program after Castro's forces toppled dictator Fulgencio Batista in 1959, but became disillusioned as Cuba deepened ties with the Soviet Union. He finally declared on the air that he was no communist, and motored to the United States in January 1961 aboard a small boat with 13 other former rebel collaborators. His wife and two daughters arrived two months later. After years of absence he began visiting Cuba and renewed his friendship with Castro. He is strongly opposed to the ultraright Cuban-Americans in South Florida and speaks out about their acts of terrorism. His daughter, Vivien Lesnick Weisman, made a documentary about her father and his political struggles -

                        <p>Gabriel Garcia Marquez (1927-2014), considered one of the greatest writers of the 20th century, was a Colombian novelist, short story author, screenwriter, and accomplished journalist. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982. Known best for his 1967 novel, 
                            <emph render="italic">One Hundred Years of Solitude</emph>, Marquez was a master of the literary genre known as magical realism. He was also known for his strong support of left-wing causes. For more than thirty years, the US State Department denied him a visa to travel in the US. According to the New York Times, this was partly because of his longtime friendship with Fidel Castro. (The travel ban was rescinded in 1995 by President Bill Clinton.) The bond between Marquez and Castro is highlighted in the 2014 Bravo film, 
                            <emph render="italic">A Conversation with Garcia Marquez About his Friend Fidel</emph>.</p>

Joining the Kennedy administration in 1961, he formed the Food for Peace organization before successfully running for the Senate in 1962. Long an advocate for ending the US Embargo with Cuba, Senator McGovern visited Fidel Castro for the first time in the 1970s, when he brought a report listing US efforts to kill the Cuban leader.</p>

At around 18 minutes, the interview with McGovern begins.</p>
                        <p>In this interview, George McGovern speaks about his maiden speech in the Senate (1963) on the subject of US-Cuba relations and about his continued support for normalization. He tells a little about himself and then talks about his initial meeting with Fidel (fourteen hours over two days). He discusses the Miami Cuban community and their control of American foreign policy towards Cuba.</p>

                        <p>Robert Alan Pastor (1947-2014) was a member of the National Security Council Staff during the administration of Jimmy Carter. With responsibility for US policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean, Pastor participated in the Carter administration’s efforts to improve relations with Cuba. Pastor also played a role in the negotiation of the Panama Canal Treaties. In a display of anger at those Treaties, Senate Republicans later prevented Pastor’s confirmation as US ambassador to Panama after his appointment by President Clinton in 1994.</p>

In 1964, he won the Sabbatino case in the US Supreme Court, which upheld Cuba’s sovereign right to nationalize American companies in Cuba. A decade later, Rabinowitz defended Chile’s right to nationalize US firms.</p>

                        <p>Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. (1917-2007) was an historian and presidential advisor. After attending Harvard University, Schlesinger served in the wartime Office of Strategic Services, the intelligence service of the Joint Chiefs of Sgtaff. Winning a Pulitzer Prize for his study of the presidency of Andrew Jackson in 1946, Schlesinger later taught at Harvard University. It was his advocacy for the Presidential candidacies of Adlai Stevenson, and later John F. Kennedy, that brought Schlesinger US national prominence. From 1961 to 1963, Schlesinger served in the White House as advisor and occasional speechwriter to President Kennedy. Latin America was among his areas of responsibility and Schlesinger opposed plans for what became known as the Bay of Pigs operation. His books

                        <p>Maximo Francisco Repilado Munoz, known as Compay Segundo, (1907 – 2003) was a Cuban trova guitarist, singer and composer introduced to much of the world on Ry Cooder's 
                            <emph render="italic">Buena Vista Social Club</emph> album.</p>
                        <p>In the 1950s he became well known as the second voice and tres player in Los Compadres, a duo he formed with Lorenzo Hierrezuelo in 1947.(It is from this partnership that his nickname comes - the second compadre.) Los Compadres were one of the most successful Cuban duos of their time. Greater international fame came later, in 1997, with the release of the 
                            <emph render="italic">Buena Vista Social Club</emph> album, a hugely successful recording which won several Grammy awards. Compay Segundo appeared in the film of the same title, made subsequently by Wim Wenders.</p>

In 1995, Ben set up a non-profit “Send a Piana to Havana” and obtained a Treasury license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to export used pianos to the island’s 90 music schools. Under that authorization, the group collected and shipped 237 pianos and many spare parts to the island. He was fined on several occasions after subsequently losing permission, although he did continue to tune pianos in Cuba in defiance of US regulations.</p>

                        <p>Oswaldo Guayasamín (1919 -1999) was an Ecuadorian master painter and sculptor. He was an ardent supporter of the Cuban Revolution in general and Fidel Castro in particular. He was given a prize for "an entire life of work for peace" by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. He is considered an Ecuadorian national treasure.</p>

                        <p>In this footage, Castro is sitting for a portrait on his 70th birthday. The painter, Oswaldo Guayasamin, is seen but this lengthy footage consists primarily of Castro speaking about a variety of subjects. (There are news photographers, including Estela Bravo, to whom he appears to be speaking.) Among other things, he talks about his recent trip to the US, describes an event where Yasser Arafat was asked to leave Lincoln Center and tells what he would have done had he been asked to leave. As the footage progresses, it is possible to see the progress of the portrait.</p>

                        <p>Among other footage content, Fidel speaks to a group and talks about how people in the US will do the right thing once they know the truth. He compares the Elian Gonzales case to the Vietnam War, saying that once people understood what was going on in Vietnam, they forced an end to the war... and the same with Elian, once they understood the truth, they pushed the government to let him return home to Cuba.</p>

                        <p>Ana Fidelia Quirot More (1963- ) is a female former track and field athlete from Cuba, a two-time World Champion (1995, 1997) and a two-time Olympic medalist (1992, 1996). Less than six months after her bronze medal win in the 1992 Olympics, an accident in her home left her with third-degree burns on her chest, face and arms. After months of operations, including grafts of synthetic skin, she began to work out and was eventually able to return to competitive running; eleven months after the accident she placed second in the 800 meters at the Central American and Caribbean Games. Subsequently she took first placein both the 800- and 400-meter races at the 1995 World Championships in Sweden.</p>

                        <p>The Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry (ICAIC) was established by the Cuban government in March 1959, after the Cuban Revolution. It was designed to produce, distribute and exhibit films and related work following the revolution; its goal was to use film as a powerful mass communication medium to mobilize and educate people, improve the quality level of Cuban films, and to reach a wide public.</p>
                        <p>Cuba's official film institution, the ICAIC has produced feature and documentary films. The institute also has an extensive film library, and its movie house, the Charles Chaplin Theatre, regularly shows both world and Cuban cinema.</p>

There are many shots of jubilant crowds as Fidel and his entourage travel through the countryside and into Havana. A bit of footage appears to have been shot in Harlem during Fidel's visit to the UN. There is a variety of additional clips.</p>

                    <p>Released in 1993, this documentary shows a fleet of small vessels setting out from Key West, Florida, to Cuba, carrying food and medicines in a humanitarian gesture sponsored by US citizens. Incidents clearly reveal the deep divisions within the Cuban community in southern Florida, even with regard to humanitarian aid. The film also shows the flotilla's arrival in Cuba and the distribution of its cargo to hospitals in Havana.</p>

Appearing in the film are US politicians including Republican Jeff Flake (Senator and former Representative, Arizona); Republican Larry Craig (former Senator and Representative, Idaho); Democrat Bill Delahunt (former Representative, Massachusetts); and Democrat Jim McGovern (Representative, Massaschusetts). They contend that travel between the countries builds openness and understanding; strengthens family ties; fosters cultural exchange, tourism and trade; and is a constitutional right for all Americans.</p>

                    <p>Carmen Gloria Quintana Arancibia (1968- ) is a Chilean woman who became, to many Chileans, a symbol of hope for democracy in Chile, receiving an embrace and encouragement from Pope John Paul II.</p>
                    <p>On July 2,1986, Quintana, along with a young photographer, Rodrigo Andres Rojas de Negri, were participating in a student protest in Santiago. They were attacked and beaten by a patrol of military police, then soaked with gasoline and set on fire. De Negri died of his burns. Gloria suffered second and third degree burns over 62% of her body; she was critically ill and was moved to a hospital in Canada. Although she survived, Gloria remains badly disfigured from her burns. When the Pope visited Chile in 1987, she returned and was able to meet with the pontiff in Santiago.</p>
                    <p>A little over a year after the Pope's visit, Pinochet's reign of torture and terror came to an end. In January 1991, a military tribunal found the military patrol leader guilty only of negligence for having failed to get medical help for de Negri. In 1993, however, he was sentenced to 600 days in prison for his responsibility in the burning death of de Negri and serious injuries suffered by Quintana. In 2000, the government was ordered to pay her 251.7 million pesos (US $500,000) in compensatory damages.</p>
                    <p>Gloria Qunitana has held teaching posts and worked with SENAME, the national Chilean organization for the protection of the rights or minors and adolescents. In 2010, she emigrated to Canada to pursue a PhD in psychology at the University of Montreal. She also serves as scientific attache at the Embassy of Chile in Canada.</p>

                    <p>This 43-minute documentary captures the turbulence of Chile under the Pinochet dictatorship, tracing the story of Carmen Gloria Quintana and her journey, in 1987, back to Chile to see the Pope. In addition to footage of the Pope's visit and the ongoing protests, there are interviews with Quintana and many others. Among the voices captured are those of elites, particularly young people, who supported the status quo and felt that the protests were unnecessary.</p>
                    <p>Among the many awards won by this film were Best Documentary on Current Affairs, San Francisco International Film Festival; Gold Plaque Award, Chicago International Film Festival; and Best Documentary, American Film Institute Global Village Festival, New York.</p>

                        <p>O'Higgins Park (Parque O'Higgins) is a public park in the center of Santiago, Chile. Pope John Paul II (in his 1987 visit) led a beautification ceremony for Saint Teresa of the Andes. Because of the violence that broke out between the Chilean police force and crowds protesting Pinochet's dictatorship, the ceremony was suspended until the situation calmed.</p>

The next year Mandela visits Cuba and, with Fidel Castro at his side, is feted everywhere.

                    <p>At the time of this film, Nelson Mandela was president of the African National Congress. He visited Cuba while on a Latin American tour. Among the tour goals was to persuade such countries as Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela to maintain sanctions against South Africa's white minority government and to support Mandela's call for a national unity government in Pretoria to supervise elections and constitutional reform. No lobbying was needed to gain Cuba's support. The visit represented a meeting between two revolutionaries who had long admired each other but never met.</p>

                        <p>During Nelson Mandela's three-day visit to Cuba in July, 1991, he attended a rally in Matanzas marking the 38th anniversary of the Moncada assault that led to Castro's seizure of power six years later. The footage documents the early parts of the rally, including the singing of the Cuban anthem, introduction of the event, identifying certain attendees (e.g. Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua) and recognition of a number of what appear to be ordinary Cubans. Castro speaks to each of them. Mandela does not speak in this clip. Other Cuban dignitaries are also on the stage (e.g. Raul Castro, Juan Almeida). The footage is all in Spanish.</p>

                        <p>The first ten minutes consists of scenes in a large chamber with no sound; Fidel enters and is seated. After a few minutes of test pattern, there is sound and a picture of the Mandelas (and Jorge Risquet) at airport boarding a plane (en route to Jamaica per Estela Bravo). There is sound and people speaking with each other but the sound of the plane engine drowns out the conversations. There are many close-ups of the various people in Mandela's entourage. Finally, the last few minutes return to a chamber filled with people but no sound.</p>

                        <p>In this footage, Estela Bravo is interviewing Lourdes Sanchez, a government chemist who works on the Isla de la Juventud.</p>
                        <p>In several other interviews as well, Bravo speaks both to Lourdes and to her mother, who has left Cuba for the US, causing a break in the family relationship. The emotional interviews, especially as presented in the documentary itself, are very moving and clearly illustrate the human tragedy of the US-Cuba conflict.</p>

                    <p>During the so-called "Dirty War" in Argentina (1976-1983), the military dictatorship abducted an estimated 30,000 people. Some were young women, pregnant or with small children. As many as 500 children were either kidnapped along with their families or born in prison The junta placed many of these children with families of military men; others were adopted by families that didn't realize their history.</p>

                    <p>In 1960, rumors were spread In Cuba, including a faked legislative draft, that the revolutionary government was planning to take children from their parents and put them in military schools or send them away for communist indoctrination. Between 1960 and 1962, as many as 14,000 children were subsequently flown out of Cuba, without their parents, in a joint effort orchestrated by the US State Department and the Catholic Church. While, in many cases, parents were later able to rejoin the children, some never saw their families again and many never again saw their homes in Cuba. Some of the children went on to achieve success in the US but many had to endure traumatic experiences and difficult adjustments. Once in the US, some were placed in orphanages or camps, and some suffered abuse. This episode is often referred to as Operation Peter Pan.</p>

Bravo describes Operation Peter Pan, which saw thousands of Cuban children traveling to the US on their own.

The documentary ends with the events that took place in the Peruvian Embassy in Havana in April 1980 and the effect they had on the Cuban people.</p>

                        <p>Lourdes Casal(1938-1981), a Cuban writer,sociologist, and activist, participated in anti-Batista activities in college, then became more counterrevolutionary. She left for New York in 1962, attended the New Schoool and was awarded a PhD in Social Psychology. In 1969 she founded the Institute of Cuban Studies and was, in 1973, invited to visit Cuba. Over time she became more supportive of the revolution and made visits attempting to connect Cubans with those who had left Cuba for the US.</p>
                        <p>For a time she taught at Rutgers where, in her honor, an annual award -The Lourdes Casal Memorial Award is given to the graduating senior selected by the faculty who best combines intellectual excellence with social commitment.</p>
                        <p>Lourdes Casal suffered with many health issues including diabetes and renal problems. On a trip to Cuba in 1979, her health deteriorated and she decided to stay, dying there in 1981.</p>

                        <p>The first portion appears to be the ending of an event honoring Casal. She is in the audience but must be helped to her feet. Someone makes an emotional speech, followed by long applause.</p>
                        <p>The remainder (and bulk) of the footage is of Estela Bravo and seven young people who represent a group who left Cuba but came back for a visit as volunteers in construction. Bravo asks a few questions but mostly the young people speak. The sound and image quality are not very good, but the footage is viewable and understandable.</p>

                        <p>Carlos Muniz Varela (1953-1979), along with his sister, was sent from Cuba to the US in 1961 as a part of Operation Peter Pan. His mother believed the rumors that the Cuban revolutionary government was planning to forcibly separate children from their parents. She was subsequently able to reunite with Carlos and Miriam and move to Puerto Rico.</p>
                        <p>As a university student in Puerto Rico, Carlos Muniz became involved in the fight for Puerto Rican independence In 1974 he was one of a group of young Cubans in Puerto Rico and the US who questioned their parents' hostility to the Cuban revolution; they founded a magazine, 
                            <emph render="italic">Areito</emph>, which promoted the normalizing of US-Cuba relations. In 1977 he and others organized a group to visit Cuba, a trip that would lead to the creation of the Antonio Maceo Brigade which brought together young Cubans to demand normalizing of relations between the US and Cuba. In addition to organizing other Cuban trips, Muniz and a friend set up Viajes Varadero, a travel agency to facilitate these trips. Attempts at promoting dialog with Cuba created many enemies within the counterrevolutionary groups and, on April 28, 1979, Muniz was ambushed while driving in San Juan and shot several times. No one has been charged with his assassination.</p>

                        <p>The first eight minutes are old black and white footage telling the story of Carlos Muniz. There is no sound. This is followed by Estela Bravo interviewing a room of women in uniform. They are from the Cuban Immigration Department. She speaks to each of them. The final few minutes appear wo involve working men outside. There is a line of people waiting to obtain passports. All is in Spanish.</p>

                    <p>This 2007 documentary provides a continuation of the Bravo's 1985 film, 
                        <emph render="italic">Missing Children</emph>, tracing the stuggle of families of those disappeared during the Argentine "Dirty War" (1976-1983) to discover the fate of their loved ones and to recover the kidnapped children of those who were killed. The organizational center of the film is the women's group known as the " Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo" who gained worldwide recognition for their weekly demonstrations in the center of Buenos Aires. Their decades-long campaigns included, not just demonstrations, but also widespread posting of photographs, presentations in school classes, and modern DNA analyses. (Geneticists from the US worked with the Grandmothers, storing blood samples from family members in the National Genetic Data Bank until the grandchildren could be located and accurately verified.) These efforts have resulted in the restoration of proper identities to 115 young adults, who have, in most cases, reestablished connections with their biological relatives.</p>
                    <p>When this film was initially released the number of found children was 88, but a new version, released in 2014, provides updates, including the news that "Grandchild 114" is Guido, the grandson of Estela Carlotto, one of the founders and president of the Grandmothers organization. She had been searching for him almost forty years. And the Grandmothers continue finding additional "children."</p>
                    <p>The film includes interviews with the young people and with people who knew their parents. Other footage shows the end of the trial and sentencing of the junta leaders; the final statements of two particularly notorious torturer-murders (a police official and a prison guard); and portions of a speech by the late Nestor Kirchner (President of Argentina from 2003-2007) in which he apologizes for ignoring the issue of the disappeared during the previous years of his political life.</p>
                    <p>Among many 2007 accolades, 
                        <emph render="italic">Who Am I? </emph>won the Coral Award, International Festival of New Latin American Cinema; Telesur Award, Best Documentary on Latin America; Best Documentary, Toronto Film Festival; Audience Popularity Award, Cinesul Film Festival, Rio de Janerio; and the Elizabeth Cady Stanton Award, High Falls Film Festival, Rochester, NY "to a filmmaker of high principles for her dedicaton to tough, life-affirming documentaries."</p>

The FARC claims to be an army of peasant Marxist-Leninists with a political platform of agrarianism and anti-imperialism. It has been known to employ a variety of military tactics and, in order to fund its operations, has used such means as illegal mining, extortion, kidnapping to ransom, taxation, and distribution of illegal drugs.</p>

This organization advocates a composite Communist ideology of Marxism and Liberation Theology. A well-known member of the group was Colombian socialist and Roman Catholic priest, Camilo Torres. During his life he tried to reconcile revolutionary Marxism and Catholicism.</p>

                        <p>Beginning with stills of a wedding, the remainder of the footage is a young man speaking in Spanish. He talks about attacks and assassinations carried out by far-right wing, anti-Castro terrorist groups, mentioning a bombing of the Cuban Mission to the UN carried out by a New Jersey-based group Omega 7. He also speaks about the larger context of these groups and discusses the assassinations of Orlando Letelier, Carlos Muniz, and Eulalio Negrin. He describes the origin of these organizations and suggests that many of their actions are motivated by anti-Castro propaganda from the US.</p>

Estela Bravo speaks with them, in Spanish, about various topics including the Reagan administration and the experience of the Spanish-speaking population in New York. They are very critical of Reagan and his policies which they consider anti-Latin. The talk about the economic situation in the US, lack of representation, lack of support for poor communities, and the difficulty of uniting Latin Americans in the US because they come from so many different countries. Other concerns include the difficulty of organizing for more rights when working too busy working at low wage jobs. Bravo asks their opinions about American policies re: Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, etc. They also discuss how the US addresses problems such as drug addiction and violence.</p>

                        <p>Luis Carlos Prestes (1898-1990) was a Brazilian revolutionary. He led rebels on a three-year trek (beginning in 1924) through the interior of Brazil in an attempt to spark a rebellion in the coutryside. The attempt failed, but he became a romantic figure in Brazil and went on to lead the Brazilian Communist Party. He was imprisoned after a 1935 uprising, but released after World War II, and served for a short time as a senator.</p>

                        <p>The footage is varied, beginning with some clips from Mandela's inauguration along with some associated news coverage. This is followed by an interview fragment (unsure of interviewee or topic). From 00:08:30 through the end of the DVD, the focus is on an American group being recognized as part of the Friendshipment program -- a speech by Cuban dignitary, then the awarding of medals to each of the Americans.</p>
