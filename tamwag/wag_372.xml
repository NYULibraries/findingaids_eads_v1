    <abstract id="aspace_d690bf9594ad56cbbeaeafcbde910224">Nancy Stearns is a public interest lawyer who has specialized in constitutional and environmental law. Stearns attended law school after working with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Atlanta. She worked as a staff lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights during the 1960s and 1970s, during which time she worked on a number of reproductive rights cases, including two cited in <emph render="italic">Roe v. Wade</emph>. She also worked on cases concerning sexual assault and women's self-defense, and was part of a team that sued Henry Kissinger and other officials in the Nixon Administration for the killing of journalist and filmmaker Charles Horman by the Chilean Junta. From 1981-1995 Stearns served as the head of the Toxics unit of the New York State Attorney General's Environmental Protection Bureau, during which she worked on litigation for the clean-up of toxic chemical contamination and the enforcement of the Worker Right to Know Law. The Nancy Stearns Collection on Workers Right to Know Law (dated 1980-1988) consists of materials collected by Stearns documenting the Right to Know regulations employers must provide workers concerning the hazardous chemicals with which they work. Materials in this collection include press releases, copies of the Right to Know legislation, standards compiled in the authoring of the law, and chemical fact sheets.</abstract>
