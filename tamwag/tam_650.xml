    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Bernice Blohm Diskin (1920-2012) was an active member in the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) and the editor of the bulletin "Cultural Reporter". Daughter of communists, Bernice Blohm grew up in New Jersey and was drawn to political involvement at a young age, first joining the Young Pioneers, the Communist Party's children's organization, and then the Young Communist League, its organization for young adults. In the late 1930s, she attended a Young Communist League dance in Ridgewoood, Queens where she met Lou Diskin, whom she married in 1941. Throughout her life Bernice Blohm Diskin was involved in a number of Communist Party activities; she served on several regional committees, as a member of the Party's National Council, and chaired a Communist Party national commission on the activities of cultural workers such as artists, writers, and actors. Diskin worked to organize the National Cultural Conference, held by the CPUSA in New York City in 1973, and began editing the bulletin "Cultural Reporter" in conjunction with the event. She edited the newsletter until 1987.</p>  </bioghist>
