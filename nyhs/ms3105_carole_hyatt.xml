These especially relate to her trilogy of books exploring the relationship of individuals to a changing workplace: "When Smart People Fail" (1987), "Shifting Gears" (1990), and "Lifetime Employability" (1995), as well as to the ramifications of women's expanding role in the workplace. The collection holds about 670 audiotapes, principally of Hyatt's interviews with individuals and focus groups, which underlie much of her published work. About 450 of these have been digitized for access.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Author, entrepreneur, and career consultant Carole Hyatt (née Schwartz) was born in 1935 in New York City. Her early life was directed toward the theatre, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Theatre and Education from Syracuse University in 1956 and her Master of Arts degree in Children's Theater and Creative Dramatics from the University of Denver in 1959. In the early 1960s, with a focus on children's programming, Hyatt worked as a producer in theatre and, at CBS, in television. In 1966 she married Gordon Hyatt, whom she met at CBS. The Hyatts have one child, daughter Ariel.</p><p>In 1966, Hyatt co-founded, with social analyst June Esserman, the research firm Hyatt/Esserman Research Associates, later know as Child Research Service. Along with analyst Daniel Yankelovich, Hyatt and Esserman provided research services to corporations and other organizations on women, youth and family interaction issues, supporting the creation of products, services and marketing strategies by their clients. This work led to the publication of Hyatt's first books, "The Woman's Selling Game: How to Sell Yourself — and Anything Else" (1979) and "Women and Work: Honest Answers to Real Questions" (1980). </p><p>In 1982, Esserman died of a heart attack. With the loss of her partner, Hyatt sold the firm in 1983 to McCollum Spielman, though remaining on the Board of Directors until 1986. While constrained by a non-compete agreement until 1986, Hyatt began work on a new book, which would be published as "When Smart People Fail: Rebuilding Yourself for Success" (1987). She interviewed 176 people for the book from various fields, both the well-known and the not well known, to explore the career setbacks of individuals and how they recovered from them. Through the 1980s and into the mid-1990s, Hyatt continued conducting interviews with men and women concerning their relationship with the workplace and with one another as society shifted to a broader acceptance of women in the professional workforce. Interviews about surviving corporate downsizing and other corporate upheavals, changing careers and finding an identity outside of the corporate setting, and finding fulfillment in retirement, among other topics, led to Hyatt's next books: "Shifting Gears: How to Master Career Change and Find the Work That's Right for You" (1992) and "Lifetime Employability: How to Become Indispensable" (1995). </p><p>Hyatt took the lessons documented in her books and used them to create workshops that she ran for organizations. These workshops were aimed at both individuals, often women, empowering them to take charge of their careers and lives, and at teams of people, unlocking the creative energies of organizations, a process referred to as "ideation." Her appeal spread internationally, perhaps especially to Asia, notably Japan, where she had a close partnership with Sakayori Noriko in the translation and publication of her work. In addition to workshops, Hyatt was a frequent speaker at conferences, such as those of the National Association for Executive Women (NAFE). </p><p>Continuing to find new partnerships and vehicles for building out her essential messages, among other initiatives, Hyatt created the Leadership Forum in the late 1990s for improving career strategies and leadership qualities for women and, in 2013, Mission: Getting to Next as a career transition program for women.</p><p>(The above note was based on various on-line sources, including Wikipedia, as well as on documents in the collection.)</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes transcripts, notes, audiotapes, working files, reference material, videotapes, and publicity material related to Carole Hyatt's publications and workshops. These especially relate to her trilogy of books exploring the relationship of individuals to a changing workplace: "When Smart People Fail" (1987), "Shifting Gears" (1990), and "Lifetime Employability" (1995). Also prominent in the working files are various concepts she researched for potential publication, such as the impact of women's increased earnings power on personal relationships and the attributes of successful couples. The range of Hyatt's activities are represented here, from books to workshops to corporate consulting to television programming possibilities. There is rich material on Hyatt's Japan initiatives of the 1980-1990s. </p><p>Hyatt's research files for her books of the 1980s and 1990s comprise a substantial portion of the collection. These include  Hyatt's notes taken during her interviews and transcriptions of many of those interviews. The collection holds about 670 audiotapes, the bulk of which are of Hyatt interviews or recordings of her on radio interviews, making presentations, and the like. About 450 of these tapes have been digitized and can be listened to on-site at New-York Historical Society.</p>  </scopecontent>

The files hold transcripts of the taped interviews or handwritten notes from the interview or both. Some files hold the cassette tape of the interview; those are noted in the container list. For the most, though, the related tapes were held apart from the document files and are found in Series III.</p><p>Especially well-represented in this subseries are transcripts related to two of Hyatt's books "When Smart People Fail" (1987) and "Shifting Gears" (1990). Related material in the subseries that did not explicitly lead to a book but are concerned with the workplace of the late twentieth century, men and women's relation to the workplace, and the shifting notions of personal success are interviews on the themes of "corporate survivors," acquiring wisdom, and handling success. The evolving role of women in society is considered in interviews on the topic of winning (i.e., successful) couples and the impact on women of gaining financial power as they enter the workforce.</p><p>A note on names: The form and spelling of names in the container list was taken from the documents. However, it is clear that variant forms and spellings of many of the names can be found in the overall collection, specifically between the transcripts and working documents (Series II) and the audiotape labels (Series III). The processing archivist noted some of these variant names, but surely not all, nor was any attempt made to reconcile them or determine a single "correct" name to use. Accordingly, users should keep in mind the potential for name variants and be cautious in relying exclusively on keyword searches.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_984fbf07676c241cee8a2c3936a17225"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged by research topic, with the two major topics first (Smart/Fail and Shifting Gears), followed by other well-defined themes advancing chronologically. Miscellaneous or less well-defined themes follow, also then advancing chronologically. For the most part, the processing archivist was able to discern the theme of the interview based on explicit markings, file structures, etc. Question marks were used in the label in cases of uncertainty.</p><p>Archival folders were used to group thematic materials together and to sequence them in an accessible manner. However, the original folders were retained and the original contents were retained within those original folders. In part, this was done because the folders include notations. But it was also done for users to be able to perceive for themselves the visual clues potentially linking individual folders together thematically. </p><p>Whenever tapes were found in a folder with, or very commonly wrapped inside, its related transcript/notes, the tape and documents were kept together. Documents/tapes now held in paper slings (i.e., not in an original folder) were generally found loose in the collection with no folder. To the extent the archivist could be reasonably sure of the topic, the material was placed in a subject category. Otherwise, these were mostly placed at the end of the subseries as unidentified topics. </p></arrangement><c id="aspace_da44a82e14af6fd7693e471f72ad89c4" level="file"><did><unittitle>When Smart People Fail Interviewees.

None of the tapes were listened to during processing but the overall subject content is clear from the tape labels and overall collection context. The bulk of the tapes are of interviews that Carole Hyatt conducted in the 1980s and 1990s during her research for her books, both those realized and those contemplated but not realized or realized in a different form than originally planned. Most of these interviews were with individuals, but also included focus groups of men and/or women, couples, business partners, or other combinations. The bulk, reflecting the experiences of regular people, are with relatively unknown individuals, but some notable figures appear, such as newscaster Walter Cronkite, author William Shirer, boxer Gerry Cooney, former U.S. senator George McGovern, Vice-Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, entrepreneur and founder of Famous Amos cookies Wally Amos, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and New York University president and former Congressman John Brademas. </p><p>Generally, the tapes are well-labeled as to the name of the interviewee, but often lack a date or identification as to which project they pertain to. Indexes found in Series II (folder title "Miscellaneous Lists and Notes about Tapes," Box 9, folder 20) can provide guidance as to the context of some of the tapes and were used by the processing archivist in developing notes in the container list.</p><p>The tapes also include recordings of Hyatt appearances on radio and television talk shows, remarks at presentations and conferences,  and, judging from the labels, her dictation of book outlines and chapters (possibly "Shifting Gears" specifically). Other tapes include recordings made by Hyatt of talks given by others on topics of interest, as well as commercially produced tapes on time management, motivational techniques, and other topics of use to Hyatt in her research.</p><p>In 2016, 457 of the audiotapes were digitized for accessibility and use. These were chosen more or less randomly so there is no overall difference between the content of the digitized and non-digitized tapes. Different access restrictions apply to both and are further described at the subseries level.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_41237482d72b61102bdb8766403b9dd6"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is organized in two subseries:</p><p>Subseries III.A.

In digital form, these amounted to 914 digital files totaling 1.09 terabytes. The container list identifies all digitized audiotapes, with information taken from the labels on the tapes (that is, no tapes were listened to to determine content). </p><p>The title used in the container list is the interviewee name or other core identifying information as found on the tape label and as used to name the related digital files. Generally each tape includes only one interviewee but where multiple names appear, those are included also in the title. Variant forms and spellings of names were common, both from side to side of a tape and among multiple tapes used for an interviewee. Variants were also found between the tapes and related paper documents in the collection. The processing archivist noted some of these variant names, especially where it seemed they might impede discovery. But surely not all variants were noted, nor was any attempt made to reconcile them or determine a single "correct" name to use. Accordingly, users should keep in mind the potential for name variants and be cautious in relying exclusively on keyword searches. </p><p>Because it is expected that patrons will only have access to the digital files, not to the physical tapes themselves, all additional information found on the label was transcribed into a note at the file level; these transcriptions are identified in the note within "quotation marks." Information not in quotation marks was supplied by the archivist in an effort to help patrons navigate the material, especially in terms of relating the digital files they will be using to the original tape.</p><p>All the tapes are represented in digital form by two files, one for side A and one for side B. This is emphasized in the container list title with the reference to "1 tape/2 files." Some interviews required two or more tapes; when this was clearly identifiable during processing it was noted in the title by such references as "2 tapes/4 files." When the possible connection between tapes was uncertain, the potential connection is referred to in a note at the tape level.</p><p>Both sides of all tapes were digitized without regard to, or even knowledge of, whether the second side had content. Accordingly, the second digital file associated with a tape may be, and likely often will be, blank. It is unknown if Hyatt did this consistently, but the labels on the tapes are commonly noted as to whether the second side (Side B) had content and to what extent (e.g., 1/8, full side, etc.). The use of multiple tapes is often indicated by labels referencing side 3, side 4, etc. The presence of such leading indicators was noted by the archivist in the container list. On the other hand, many tapes are labeled on one side only, with nothing noted on Side B. It seems likely that these were indicators that Side B was blank. However, the archivist did not want to imply this, as it might not be the case, and so no reference is made in the notes to the absence of a label on Side B.</p><p>Very few of the tapes were labeled to indicate which book or project they related to. However, indexes in the paper files provide this information for some of the tapes. These indexes are found in Series II (folder title "Miscellaneous Lists and Notes about Tapes," Box 9, folder 20). These indexes were used as the source for some of the notes added to the container list by the processing archivist.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_228ce7c2b275848e12ef6bcf96a2423e"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Approximately one-half of the digitized tapes had dates on their labels. These tapes are presented first in the container list, in chronological order. These are followed by the other tapes, which are undated. Undated tapes are arranged in alphabetical order by interviewee surname, group name, or other key identifier from the label. Some undated tapes could be associated with a dated tape and so were included at that point in the container list.</p><p>The physical audiotapes are arranged differently from the container list. These are boxed in the order in which they were digitized, with each tape assigned a sequence number. The sequence number/order of digitization was random with no relationship to chronology, subject matter, etc. </p><p>The digital files are maintained by the Digital Collections staff. The file names include a combination of the sequence number, an "a" or "b" indicating the side of the tape, and the interviewee or other content identifier from the tape label. For content spanning two or more tapes, each with its unique sequence number, a "c," "d," etc. is used with the name to associate the files.</p></arrangement><accessrestrict id="aspace_62c3a7f82d79b033c4a305d686f4bd09"><head>Conditions Governing Access</head><p>There are conditions governing access to the audiotapes and to the digital files of those tapes.

For this tape 442, the label on side 1 of the tape itself reads only "Egon".</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_35e9f3e6cfe8255b27d4dbce8d11c8d3" level="file"><did><unittitle>Elman, Lee (1 tape/2 files)</unittitle><unitdate>undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_53315aef8096af233908e7b7db72a402" label="Audio" type="Box">T2</container><container parent="aspace_53315aef8096af233908e7b7db72a402" type="Item">140</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_7e4d8562765a050b703e5b874fe32f0d"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Labeled on both sides of tape.
