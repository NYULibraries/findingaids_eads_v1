    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The files from the <title render="italic">Time</title> Research Center originally belonged to a Time Inc. library known throughout the years as The Morgue, The Bureau of Editorial Reference, and The Editorial Reference Library. It seems like the library existed longest as The Editorial Reference Library, and most staff referred to it as "Edit Ref". The library maintained research materials that reporters and researchers from all magazines used when writing articles. Editorial Services managed the library along with the Picture Collection (later called the <title render="italic">Life</title> Picture Collection), Archives (beginning in the mid-1990s), the Index Department (closed in 1994 or 1995), and the Photo Lab.</p><p> The files were built over the years from the various magazines' Carbon Files. A Carbon File was created by a reporter for every article that ran in a Time Inc. magazine, comprising all the collected research, and retained by that magazine for around 14 months before being turned over to the Editorial Reference Library. There the contents were distributed into the Bio, Subject or Company Files. Library staff also added additional clippings to the files. The bulk of the Company Files were sent to an offsite storage facility and lost in a series of storage facility arsons in the mid-1990s.</p><p> Time Warner closed The Editorial Reference Library in 2001 after the AOL merger failure. At this time, staff culled the files and sent some to the smaller libraries funded by individual magazines. Business and finance subjects went to the Business Information Research Center, a library used by <title render="italic">Money</title> and <title render="italic">Fortune</title>, and <title render="italic">Fortune</title> still maintains these files. Entertainment industry subjects went to the <title render="italic">People</title> Research Center, and these files later were acquired by the LAC Group. Files not culled or sent to another library became property of the newly created <title render="italic">Time</title> Research Center housed in offsite storage.</p><p> Citations:</p><p> Bill Hooper, email message to Holly Deakyne, 6 July 2016.</p><p> Bill Hooper, email message to Holly Deakyne, 25 August 2016. </p><p> Bill Hooper, email message to Holly Deakyne, 15 May 2017.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The Time Inc. <title render="italic">Time</title> Research Center Files contain research materials used by reporters and researchers at various magazines across Time Inc. The files are in four main series of Bio Files, Presidents Files, Subject Files, and Microfilm with smaller series of Administrative Files containing guides and manuals for <title render="italic">Time</title> Research Center staff and users of the reference materials in the library. </p><p> The majority of research and reference materials are magazine and newspaper clippings. Other types of material include telegrams and other correspondence, correspondent dispatches, transcripts of interviews and speeches, editorial outlines for articles, editorial policies, press releases, and drafts of articles. Microfilm contains reels created by the The Editorial Reference Library during a major imaging project in the mid-1960s mainly of raw reporting and dispatches from correspondents. The reels also contain the only examples of the destroyed Company Files which were lost in fires. </p><p> According to the deed of gift transferring the archive to the New-York Historical Society, "Most of what survives of Time Inc. correspondent cables and raw reportage in hard copy format" is in the Bio Files and Subject Files of this record group. The deed may also mean the material on the microfilm reels.</p>  </scopecontent>

While a wide range of materials were collected, many of the items focus on important events that the president attended, any honors the president received prior to or during their presidency, domestic and foreign policies of an administration, public appearances and statements made by the president, White House staffing decisions, the finances of the incoming president, recreational activities that the president enjoyed, and details about their family.</p><p>  Materials related to a specific president and a specific subject are in files that include the president's name and a subject as part of the titles. Subjects frequently collected include administration, advisers and assistants, appointments, awards and honors, cabinet, cartoons, congress, correspondence, domestic affairs, family, finances, foreign relations, inauguration, politics, polls, press relations, recreation, speeches, travel, and welfare. Files titled "Sketches" includes general material or biographical details or essays about the president and not drawings. Duplicates of items can be found in different folders for a president if the item relates to more than one topic.</p><p>  The majority of materials are magazine and newspaper clippings. Other types of material include article correction forms, telegrams, correspondent dispatches, correspondence between reporters as well as correspondence with White House press representatives, transcripts of interviews and speeches, editorial outlines for articles, editorial policies, press releases, event schedules and programs, event invite lists, lists of White House staff, campaign pamphlets, biographical overviews, drafts of articles, academic papers and articles about the president and his policies, and financial reports.</p><p>  According to the storage facility used by Time Inc., one box of John F. Kennedy files spanning from "Powers and Duties" to "Quotes" was destroyed in a flood.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_ref1525"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Based on the original schema, the materials within the Presidents Files are organized chronologically by presidential term and titled with the president's name starting with George Washington and ending with Bill Clinton. Not all presidents are represented within the files. Within each president, files are further organized alphabetically by subject with general files at the front.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_ref2" level="file"><did><unittitle>Washington, George:

Subject Files is located here</extref>.</p><p>The Subject Files contain research materials related to common headline news topics that were used by reporters and researchers at magazines across Time Inc. Major topics covered include weapons and wars, geographic regions, populations of the United States and the Soviet Republic, domestic and international press organizations, United States elections, and word usage. Topics are frequently divided into sub-topics. For example, the files on New York City include boroughs, neighborhoods, government departments and agencies, parks, and extended folders on different streets. </p><p>Because these files were heavily used, there is some amount of misfiling.</p><p>The majority of materials within the Subject Files are magazine and newspaper clippings. Other types of materials include article correction, correspondent dispatches, correspondence between reporters, correspondence between reporters and editors, correspondence from the general public to magazine editors, transcripts of interviews and speeches as well as press conferences, summaries of interviews, editorial outlines for articles, government and foreign policy overviews, press releases, press kits, event schedules and programs, lists of contacts and committee members as well as research sources, lists of award winners, pamphlets, drafts of articles, academic and scientific papers, financial reports, photos, congressional reports, and factsheets.

These reels were created in the mid-1960s so the materials imaged date prior to that. As hard copies of the Company Files were lost in storage facility fires, this microfilm is the only remaining examples of those files.</p><p> The Subject Rolls have two sets of alphabetically ordered reels. The first set is Roll 1 to 108 and the second set is Roll 109 to 268. The difference in sets might be date ranges since there is overlap in subject headings.</p><p> On some of the original Edit Ref file folders in the hard copy series, stamping indicates that the Time-Life News Service Correspondent wires have been removed from the folder and microfilmed, noting which microfilm reel the material can be found on.</p><p> In order to search the microfilm, there is an index on index cards. Each group of microfilm has cards listing contents in numerical order by reel number then alphabetically by name or heading. The index is stored onsite for easier reference. Several boxes of microfilm also include a copy of the corresponding index card.</p><p> Citation:</p><p> Bill Hooper, email message to Holly Deakyne, 23 August 2018.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_01fd253d7923a1a97e32b10696c0b9e8"><head>Arrangement</head><p>Organized alphabetically by the three groups of imaged files, Bio, Company, and Subject, along with an index of the microfilm at the end.
