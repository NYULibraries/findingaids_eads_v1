In civilian life he found work as a social worker, farmer and, finally, as a high-school teacher of Latin. Iceland was an active member of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) and edited VALB’s newsletter,

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Ben Iceland (1910-1990), son of the Yiddish poet Rueben Iceland, was born on New York’s Lower East Side and raised in the Bronx. Iceland graduated from New York University in 1933 with a degree in classics. Upon graduation he held a series of makeshift jobs, everything from shoveling snow to working as a theater usher, until taking a position in 1934 with New York City’s Home Relief Bureau, the forerunner of the Welfare Department. Once he landed a steady job, Iceland married Claire Brown, a union organizer.</p>
            <p>In 1937, Iceland, against the wishes of his wife and unbeknownst to his mother, joined the International Brigades. During the Spanish Civil War he was a machine-gunner with the Czech and John Brown anti-aircraft batteries, and he was among the last American volunteers to leave Spain. Upon his return from Spain, Iceland, a member of the Communist Party from the mid-1930s, rejoined the city’s Welfare Department. When his membership in the Communist Party was exposed, however, he lost his job. By the early 1940s Iceland’s marriage had ended. When World War II broke out, Iceland joined the United States Army, and spent the war years on duty in California. After the war Iceland took a job helping displaced European Jews find work and housing, and he worked briefly as a union organizer. Finding himself increasingly under investigation by the FBI, Iceland bought a farm outside Albany, and took up farming near Frank “Ski” Buturla, a friend from the Spanish Civil War. In 1962, after having obtained a graduate degree, Iceland moved to New Jersey and taught Latin in a local high school until he retired in 1976. Iceland had by this time remarried. His second wife, Marianne, was a native of Vienna.</p>
            <p>Iceland was an active member of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB). In 1982 Manny Harriman, then retiring as editor of 
                <emph render="italic">the Volunteer</emph>, VALB’s newsletter, tapped Iceland to become the next editor thus moving editorial functions of 
                <emph render="italic">the Volunteer</emph> from the West Coast to the East. Changing the location of 
                <emph render="italic">the Volunteer's</emph> editorial board was only one of many VALB controversies over which Iceland would preside as editor. Iceland served as editor of 
                <emph render="italic">the Volunteer</emph> from 1982 until shortly before his death in 1990.</p>

                    <p>The bulk of the correspondence (1982-1990) is from fellow veterans of the Spanish Civil War, and is related to Iceland’s tenure as editor of 
                        <emph render="italic">the Volunteer</emph>. Many letters expand on controversies within VALB, or comment on articles and reviews published in 
                        <emph render="italic">the Volunteer</emph>. Subjects include contemporary issues such as the war in Nicaragua and proliferation of nuclear arms; the selection of material for the anthology, Our Fight, edited by Alvah Bessie and Albert Prago; as well as subjects related to the Spanish Civil War. Communism and Socialism were perennial sources of debate. Many letters include reminiscences of the war in Spain.</p>
                    <p>The correspondence includes letters from more than fifty different persons; Victor Berch, Alvah Bessie, Irving Weissman and Milton Wolff are among the more prolific correspondents. A 1990 letter from Carl Geiser provides a lengthy description of his trip to Cuba. Notable, too, is the correspondence from Wilhelm “Willi” Schutt, a 1929 German immigrant to New York City who fought with the Lincoln Battalion in Spain. Schutt, denied entry to the United States after the Spanish Civil War, lived in England during World War II. After the war he moved to East Germany where he lived until his death.</p>
