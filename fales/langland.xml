It largely consists of material related to New York City venues from the mid 1970s through the 1990s , but also includes other localities. Included in this series is material related to many notable New York City performance spaces and groups, including Danspace, Dance Theater Workshop LaMama, and Movement Research. Due to the nature of the type of material, many of the posters, programs and flyers do not include a year.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_da1850dae9c3d2ade98c73e9a0a0dd36"><head>Arrangement Note</head><p>Series IV is arranged into two subseries, reflecting Paul Langland's original organization.
