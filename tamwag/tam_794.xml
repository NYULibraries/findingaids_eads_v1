    <abstract id="aspace_1949a5619e6d13533e3a7cc74471eadd">Mollie Siegel (1918-2011) was a California activist and nurse involved in the Nuclear Freeze campaign, anti-war movements, and other progressive social movements in the mid- and late 20th century. The Mollie Siegel Collection on Anti-Nuclear and Peace Movement Activism (dated 1957-1999) consists of materials created and collected by Siegel documenting her organizing work in the peace and anti-nuclear movements in California. The bulk of the collection consists of pamphlets, flyers for actions, newsletters, reading lists, and reports, many of which had been initially laid into a scrapbook. The collection also contains handwritten notes, copies of letters Siegel received from elected representatives, and a copy of the cookbook <emph render="italic">Peace De Resistance</emph>. Major topics present in this collection include the American military budget, the Nuclear Freeze campaign, international arms agreements, and peace activism, with particular emphasis on opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War and the Gulf War. The activities of South Bay Citizens for Peace are particularly well represented. In addition to the specific movements documented in this collection, these materials also reflect the activism of this period through Siegel's perspective as a woman.</abstract>
