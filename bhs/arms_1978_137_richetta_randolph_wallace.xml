            <p>The collection is organized in the following three series:</p>
            <p>1. NAACP</p>

            <p>3. James Weldon Johnson Papers</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Richetta G. Randolph (1884-circa 1971) was born May 12, 1884, in Chesterfield County, Virginia, but attended schools in Plainview, New Jersey. While in her early twenties, she launched a career in office administration after attending Gaffey's Business School in New York City. Her family origins and early life remain obscure, for although correspondence between her and A. Phillip Randolph (1889-1979) presume a relationship as siblings, their biographies differ as to place of origin and early education. In 1914, she married Frank E. Wallace. Mr. Wallace appears in some personal notes and ephemera in the collection, notably in a set of what are likely suicide notes, written in 1921. Richetta did not remarry, and her use of a last name subsequent to 1921 varies between Randolph and Wallace. Because her use of Randolph seems more frequent, that is the name used in this finding aid. In 1933, Randolph moved to 251 Decatur Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, New York, where she lived up to the 1970s.</p>
            <p>In 1905, Randolph became private secretary to reformer and social worker Mary White Ovington (1865-1951). Seven years later, Randolph was hired as the first member of the administrative staff for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She later became the NAACP's office manager and was private secretary to NAACP officers James Weldon Johnson (1871-1938) and Walter White (1893-1955). She also served as Clerk of the Conference for NAACP annual conferences. In 1945, Randolph became the Clerk of the Board and Confidential Secretary to the Executive Secretary. She held the latter position for one year until her full retirement from the NAACP in 1946, at which time she continued to work for her church, the historically black Mt. Olivet Baptist Church in Harlem. She became the Secretary to Dr. O. Clay Maxwell of Mt. Olivet, a position she held for over a decade. Her involvement with Mt. Olivet was multifaceted, for in addition to her secretarial duties, at different points in her life she served on the Board of Trustees, helped to raise funds, represented the church at out-of-town meetings, and wrote a play depicting its history.</p>
            <p>Randolph kept a scrapbook with material from her anniversary celebration (in 1943) commemorating 30 years of service to the NAACP. On this occasion, people who had worked with her or met her at the NAACP sent her cards and monetary gifts. She was knowledgeable of and had close relationships with several members of the NAACP leadership. Chief among them was Mary White Ovington with whom a strong relationship grew after years of working with her independently and then through the NAACP; this relationship continued to Ovington's death in 1951.</p>

            <head>Processing Information note</head>
            <p>The material was in no particular order when received by the Long Island Historical Society (now Brooklyn Historical Society) in 1975. An initial inventory and boxing of the collection was done in 1977 by Barbara Germack. That inventory was refined by Judith Box in 1986. In September-October 1997, the collection was rearranged and described by Tanya Elder, Project Assistant Archivist. As part of that processing, photographs were separated from the collection. In May 2006, Judith A. Burgess conducted a thorough survey of the collection, which resulted in expanded description and finding aid, with additional preservation work for fragile documents. In October 2011, Project Archivist Larry Weimer modified the finding aid to accommodate requirements for input to a collection management system, Archivists' Toolkit. During this processing, the previously separated photographs were returned to the collection. In April 2015, Archivist John Zarrillo encapsulated the article "Lynching: America's national disgrace" (1924) for preservation purposes and placed the document in an oversize container.</p>

            <p>The collection consists of the personal and business papers of Richetta Randolph Wallace, an African-American woman having a longstanding engagement with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Mt. Olivet Baptist Church in Harlem, African-American literary and arts culture, and matters of race relations, racial justice and civil rights. Documents include correspondence, pamphlets and other published print matter, event programs and other ephemera, photographs, receipts, manuscripts, and newspaper clippings.</p>
            <p>Principal correspondents in the collection are James Weldon Johnson and Mary White Ovington. Other correspondents include Arthur Spingarn, Walter White, Roy Wilkins, William Pickens, and Oswald Garrison Villard of the NAACP, A. Phillip Randolph, and authors Charles Flint Kellogg and Robert L. Zangrando. The bulk of this correspondence concerns Randolph's activities and perspectives as office manager and personal secretary. Her correspondence with Johnson dates from the mid-1920s and the bulk of her other NAACP-related correspondence dates from the 1930s-1940s. Other correspondence documents Randolph's activities on behalf of Mt. Olivet over the years. There is a small amount of personal correspondence, including what are likely suicide notes from Wallace's husband, Frank.</p>
            <p>The collection includes a full typescript draft of Johnson's 
                <emph render="italic">Black Manhattan</emph>, with notes, and a galley proof (1930) of the book. Much of the collection consists of print matter, which centers on matters of race in the United States, including discrimination, lynching, justice (or injustice), and civil rights. Other print matter includes programs, sermons, church newsletters, and other materials, principally concerning Mt. Olivet Baptist Church. Most of these materials are identified at the item level in the container list in this guide. There are a small number of photographs in the collection, including those of Randolph, of Johnson and his wife in Great Barrington (1929), of Ovington, and stock images of NAACP principals. There is an oversize group photograph from the NAACP convention in Kansas City (1923).</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
                    <p>The series represents Richetta Randolph Wallace's longstanding engagement with the NAACP, Mt. Olivet Baptist Church in Harlem, and matters of race relations and racial justice. The series includes correspondence, photographs, pamphlets, programs, and ephemera. The correspondence includes exchanges with authors Charles Flint Kellogg and Robert L. Zangrando, and Mary White Ovington, William Pickens, A. Phillip Randolph, and Oswald Garrison Villard. Among the personal correspondence are suicide notes from Randolph's husband, Frank Wallace. The photographs principally include images of Randolph and several prominent NAACP figures. There is an oversize group photograph from the NAACP convention in Kansas City (1923).</p>
                    <p>A sizable part of the series is comprised of pamphlets, journals, and other print matter. Much of this material concerns matters of race in the United States, including discrimination, lynching, justice (or injustice), and civil rights. Other print matter includes programs, sermons, church newsletters, and other materials, principally concerning Mt. Olivet Baptist Church of New York City. Some print materials concern African-American literature or other cultural matters. One notable item of ephemera is a retirement card to Randolph signed by W.E.B. Du Bois, Thurgood Marshall, and other NAACP staff.</p>
                    <p>Several of Randolph's activities on behalf of Mt. Olivet are represented in the series, among them her work as Chair of Women's Day (1942) and her authorship of a historical play, "Mt. Olivet: Yesterday and Today" (1953).</p>

                    <p>The series includes documents compiled by Richetta Randolph Wallace in connection with her work for James Weldon Johnson at the NAACP and as his personal secretary. The series includes much correspondence between the two from the 1920s in relation to business matters. The series includes a full typescript draft of Johnson's 
                        <emph render="italic">Black Manhattan</emph>, with notes, plus a galley proof of the book, as well as one folder of research conducted by Randolph for Johnson. Johnson was killed in a car accident in 1938, and the collection contains newspaper clippings about his death, plus letters to and from Carl Van Vechten, who compiled Johnson's papers into a collection currently housed at Yale University. Biographical and autobiographical material, articles, congratulatory letters, and a small collection of materials on Johnson's 1929 trip to Japan are also included.</p>
