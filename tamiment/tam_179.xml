            <p>Morris U. Schappes (1907-2004) was a scholar, editor and activist who was fired by the City College of New York after being investigated as a Communist Party member, and who spent over a year in prison (1943-1944) for perjury after refusing to name other Party members when testifying before an investigating committee of the New York State Legislature. He was a founder and long-time editor of the progressive, secular magazine 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Currents</emph>; a popular lecturer; and the author of articles, reviews, radio broadcasts, books and monographs, many of them on U.S. Jewish history.</p>
            <p>Born Moishe Shapshilevich in Kamenetz-Podolsk, Ukraine, Schappes spent his earliest years in Brazil and then moved with his parents to New York City in 1914. Bureaucrats reduced the family name to Schappes and his mother Americanized his name as Morris. He added the middle “U” later as part of his byline as a sportswriter on the newspaper of City College of New York (CCNY), where he graduated in 1928 and subsequently joined the faculty as an English lecturer. (He had previously attended Townsend Harris Hall High School.) He also attended Columbia University as a graduate student, earning a master’s degree in 1930. In that same year, he began his sixty-two year marriage to Sonya Laffer, who died in 1992.</p>
            <p>A longtime fixture in the world of American Communism, Schappes gained widespread attention in 1941 when he was fired, along with 40 others, from the faculty of CCNY for Communist Party membership or involvement. The school had first attempted to dismiss him in 1936 for his political activities but he was retained as the result of a student protest. Later he served 13 1/2 months (1943-1944) in prison for perjury after refusing to name other Party members before New York’s Joint Legislative Committee on the State Education System (known as the Rapp-Coudert Committee). After his release from prison, Schappes worked briefly in a war production factory in Queens and, in 1946, joined with other Party activists to found the magazine 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Life</emph>, which became an unofficial Party organ. He supplemented his income by freelance lecturing and writing.</p>
            <p>As a scholar, Schappes first achieved some prominence for his work on the poetry and letters of Emma Lazarus, and he published a number of books and monographs between 1944 and 1987. Having developed a strong interest in Jewish history while serving in prison, he subsequently published two broad historical studies: 
                <emph render="italic">A Documentary History of the Jews in the United States, 1654-1877</emph> (1950) and 
                <emph render="italic">The Jews in the United States: A Pictorial History, 1654 to the Present</emph> (1958).</p>
            <p>In the early 1950s, Schappes experienced another brush with government committees when the State Department began a purge of books from the shelves of overseas libraries operated by the United States Information Agency. The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, held hearings to support McCarthy’s demand that 30,000 “Communist books” be removed, including Schappes’ 
                <emph render="italic">A Documentary History of the Jews…</emph>. In April of 1953, Schappes was subpoenaed and appeared before the committee to defend his books and to attack McCarthyism.</p>
            <p>After Nikita Krushchev’s 1956 speech denouncing the misdeeds of Stalin, the subscription base of 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Life</emph> began slipping away and the magazine’s staff joined many of the rank-and-filers in their disillusion with the Communism they had known. The result was the founding of 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Currents</emph>, with Morris Schappes as its editor; the journal, independent of Party discipline and financing, would become an intellectual home for an increasingly diverse base of (mostly) secular Jewish leftists.</p>
            <p>Schappes dedicated more than four decades to 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Currents</emph>, and to shaping the views of its enthusiastic and loyal readership. In his “Editor’s Diary” column, he reported on books, plays, films and events in the progressive Jewish movement and engaged in a number of noteworthy controversies, including a historical defense of American Jewish responses to the Holocaust; commentaries about solidarity and tensions between U.S. Jews and African-Americans; and his concerns about antisemitism in Shakespeare’s 
                <emph render="italic">The Merchant of Venice</emph>. Schappes played an active role in the day-to-day management of 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Currents</emph> until 2000.</p>
            <p>Throughout his working life, he was a sought-after lecturer and commentator on Jewish affairs and wrote many articles, essays and letters to the editor in a variety of newspapers, magazines and journals. In 1981, the faculty senate of City College formally apologized for firing him and his colleagues.</p>
            <p>Morris Schappes died in New York City on June 3, 2004. He was 97 years old.</p>

            <p>The collection contains correspondence, published and unpublished writings, clippings and other printed ephemera, research materials and documents produced by various progressive organizations. The Schappes Papers reveal a man of widely varying interests, radical views, strong opinions and devotion to the magazine he helped found -- 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Currents</emph>. The collection provides not only a glimpse into Schappes’ personal life and his involvement with the American left, but also a record of the day-to-day management the magazine itself.</p>

            <p>Another important source of archival material concerning the life and times of Morris Schappes is the American Jewish Historical Society (AJHS). Schappes (and 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Currents</emph> staff) made donations to the AJHS Library in 1968, 1979 and 2004. The 1968 donation is especially relevant as it focuses on Schappes' dealings with the Rapp-Coudert Committee and his time in prison, represented by court documents, trial notes, pamphlets, newspaper articles, press releases, and prison rules and regulations. Of particular interest is the correspondence, which includes many letters of support written during his legal battles and prison correspondence with his friends, with servicemen (1943-1946), and with his wife, Sonya. The remainder of the collection consists of materials Schappes generated and collected between 1931 and 1990 in connection with his professional work as a scholar, writer and editor. (See AJHS

            <head>Immediate Source of Acquisition</head>
            <p>Gift of Morris Schappes and 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Currents</emph> staff in a series of donations from 1996 to 2004. An addional gift of four post cards was donated by Swarthmore College in 2013. The accession number associated with this gift is 2013.037.</p>

        <processinfo id="ref1653">
            <head>Processing Information Note</head>
            <p>The Schappes donations spanned a number of years and there had been several attempts to ‘arrange’ the earlier materials. Also, at the time of the final donation (after Schappes’ death), the removal of materials from his apartment had to be done quickly and accomplished jointly with staff from the American Jewish Historical Society, who were also to receive some of the items. Under these circimstances, maintaining any significant original order would have been difficult. In addition, much of the material (from all donations) lacked organization, was not in folders and had been randomly placed in boxes.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> One characteristic of Schappes’ files was his creation of individual packets of material which were scattered throughout the collection. He often used clips to hold together related items rather than placing them in folders. For example, an incoming letter or an article of interest would be accompanied by additional research and correspondence, hand written notes and, perhaps, an event flyer or list of citations. In processing the collection, these packets of material were kept together and, in most cases, formed the basis of a titled folder. For materials that were already contained within folders, the original titles were retained to the extent possible.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> Correspondence appears in many parts of the collection and, in the case of 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Currents</emph> correspondence, much of the original order was maintained even though magazine's staff over the years had changed its arrangement scheme from alphabetic by correspondent name to chronological. There are sections of each, as well as specific groups of correspondence such as rejection letters sent to individuals whose submissions to the magazine were not accepted for publication.
                <lb/>
                <lb/> A series arrangement was imposed based on the aggregation of 
                <emph render="italic">Jewish Currents</emph> files, identification of personal items and biographical material, and creation of a very large section of subject files reflecting Schappes' wide variety of interests and activities. WBAI broadcast materials and audio files were placed in separate series.</p>

                    <p>In September of 1966, Morris Schappes began hosting a weekly “Commentary on Jewish Affairs” at FM radio station WBAI, New York. The station advertised the program as “a secular Jewish point of view on contemporary Jewish development in relation to general American issues and in relation to Jewish life and cultural expression in literature and the arts.” This series contains broadcast materials from September 6, 1966 through May 30, 1967. Topics vary and include such titles as “Johnson, the Jews and Vietnam,” “East Side, East Side, A Museum View,” “Black Power and the Jews” and “Morton Sobell on our Conscience”. There are transcripts of the broadcasts along with newspaper clippings, magazine articles, correspondence and notes associated with Schappes’ research and preparation. The series also contains a small amount of material related to other WBAI programs hosted by

                    <p>The largest by far, this series provides an in-depth look at Morris Schappes’ wide-ranging interests. It is composed of material he collected either as background for his many books, articles, reviews, editorials, letters to the editor, radio broadcasts and classroom teaching, or simply because the items were of interest to him. His annotations are found throughout the many newspaper clippings, articles, event programs, exhibit catalogs, reviews, obituaries and publications in the series.</p>
                    <p>Emma Lazarus was of particular interest to Schappes. Lazarus-related material includes manuscript drafts, typescript and galleys for his writings along with related notes, clippings, transcriptions of her letters, reviews, press releases, scripts, sheet music and a good amount of correspondence. Black-Jewish relations is another well-represented topic, as is antisemitism, particularly as depicted in Shakespeare’s 
                        <emph render="italic">The Merchant of Venice</emph> and Dickens’ 
                        <emph render="italic">Oliver Twist</emph>. Other topics of interest include academic freedom, immigration, Communism, secularism, the Red Scare, reproductive rights and Israel. Among the many historical, political and literary figures in whom Schappes took an interest are Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Ilya Ehrenberg, Roy Cohn, Mario Cuomo, Ernestine Louise Rose, the Foner family (Eric, Henry, Jack, Moe and Philip), Sherwin Wine, Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings, Pete Seeger, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Organizations such as the Jewish People's Franternal Order and such topics as Holocaust history, the Bicentennial of the American Revolution and the Bakke Case are also represented.</p>
                    <p>A significant portion of the series is devoted to Schappes’ research, much of it identified with either 
                        <emph render="italic">A Documentary History of the Jews in the United States, 1654-1877</emph> or 
                        <emph render="italic">The Jews in the United States: A Pictorial History, 1954 to the Present</emph>. There is also general research material on Jewish history, Jewish identity and culture, and Jewish labor history.</p>
                    <p>A number of book, film and theater reviews are included, along with pamphlets, newsletters, reports and other publications. Of the newspaper clippings and journal articles scattered throughout the series, many are written in Yiddish and a few are in French or Spanish.</p>
