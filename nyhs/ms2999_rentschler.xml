<p>Gift to the New-York Historical Society of Susan Witter, 2016 (accession no. MS-2016-06).<lb/>
<lb/>
In 1988 Susan Rentschler Witter received two metal blanket boxes, two regular suitcases, two storage boxes, and one wooden chest of archival materials comprising approximately sixteen-and-a-half linear feet of papers. The papers belonged primarily to her mother, Mary Coolidge Atkins Rentschler. A smaller group of materials belonged to her aunt, Helen Rentschler Waldon.<lb/>
<lb/>
After Mary C. Rentschler's death in 1988, the materials were transferred from her apartment and basement at 770 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y., to the apartment of Susan R. Witter at 1040 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. Materials concerning Rentschlers, Schwabs and Waldons were sent from Hamilton, Ohio in 1995.<lb/>
<lb/>
In 2000 Susan R. Witter contributed some of her own papers concerning her mother's death to the collection. In 2001 Phoebe Rentschler Stanton, Mary C. Rentschler's second daughter, contributed a family genealogy (a bound volume created by Julia Shepley Coolidge, circa 1907; see Box 17 of memorabilia collection) from her home in New York, N.Y., and Mary Rentschler Lowrey, Mary C. Rentschler's third daughter, transferred a box of glass slides and a box of photographs belonging to Sidney Dunn Waldon, as well as newspaper clippings, from her home in San Francisco to her sister Susan R. Witter's home in New York, N.Y.<lb/>
<lb/>
In October 2003 Mary Rentschler Lowrey contributed approximately 2 linear feet of print, news clippings, and photographic materials to the Mary Coolidge Rentschler collection. The print materials are housed in 2 manuscript boxes and are labeled as a contribution from Mary R. Lowrey. The photographs and oversize documents are integrated into the larger collection.</p>  </acqinfo>

    <head>Biographical and Historical Note</head>
<p>The materials are primarily the personal papers of Mary C. Rentschler (1892–1988). She was the eldest daughter of Charles Allerton Coolidge (1858–1936), a prominent Boston architect, and Julia Shepley Coolidge (1856–1935), the descendant of old New England, Missouri, and New York families. The family of her first husband, Edwin Farnsworth Atkins Jr. (1892–1923), was a leading North American sugar producer in Cuba. Her second husband, Gordon Sohn Rentschler (1885–1948), was the son of a successful Ohio industrialist. Gordon S. Rentschler became a prominent banker and Chairman of the National City Bank of New York from 1940–1948.<lb/>
<lb/>
The smaller amount of materials within the collection are the personal papers of Helen Rentschler Waldon (1890–1967), Gordon S. Rentschler's sister and the wife of Sidney Dunn Waldon (1873–1945), a pioneer in the U.S. automotive and aeronautical industries.<lb/>
<lb/>
The papers are an amalgam of the histories of the three dominant family groups within the collection: Americans of English descent (Coolidge, Shepley, Shurtleff, Clapp); New England sugar planters in Cuba (Atkins); and nineteenth-century German immigrants who became industrialists in Ohio (Rentschler, Schwab).<lb/>
<lb/>
The period in United States history that is covered by the bulk of this collection, circa 1875–1950, witnessed the transformation of America into a leading industrialized nation, and the three businesses that form the backdrop to the collection: sugar, iron and steel, and banking were at the heart of this growth.<lb/>
<lb/>
The lynchpin that connects the family to these three industries is Mary Shepley Coolidge Atkins Rentschler (Mary C. Rentschler). Mary C. Rentschler was the daughter of Julia Shepley and Charles Allerton Coolidge. Mary Rentschler's ancestors—the Shepley, Coolidge, and Shurtleff families—arrived in America in the 1630s from England, and were among the original colonizers of Watertown, Groton, and Salem, Massachusetts, as well as Livermore, Maine. For much of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they were farmers, grocers, and selectmen (town officials). However, after the Revolution—in which Benjamin Shurtleff, David Hill, and two Shepley generations fought—family members became professionals and enjoyed distinguished careers. Ether Shepley (1789–1877) became a U.S. Supreme Court Judge in Portland, Maine. His son moved to Missouri where he became a successful lawyer and married the daughter of Benjamin Clapp, a prominent merchant employed by fur trader John Jacob Astor of New York. Mary C. Rentschler's grandfather, David Hill Coolidge (1833–1907), was a prominent Boston lawyer, and his son became one of the leading architects of his day. Charles Allerton Coolidge was a design partner for Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch &amp; Abbott from 1886–1936. Among the approximately 370 buildings he designed (excluding alterations and additions) are Stanford University in California, the Public Library in Chicago and the Chicago Art Institute, Boston's South Station railroad terminal, Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum, New York Hospital, and buildings for the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research in New York, and a hospital and medical school in Beijing, China.<lb/>
<lb/>
Mary C. Rentschler's solid New England background formed the bedrock of her two marriages and subsequent connections to the sugar, iron and steel, and banking industries. The first of these marriages was to Edwin F. Atkins Jr., the son of a prominent sugar producer in Cuba. Both the Coolidge and Atkins families were based in Belmont, Massachusetts. Mary C. Rentschler married Edwin F. Atkins Jr. in 1916, beginning an association with Cuba that would last fifty years. The Atkins family's involvement with Cuba began in 1838 when Elisha Atkins started importing molasses and raw sugar from Cuba. In 1883, three years before the abolition of slavery, the family acquired Soledad. This 4,500-acre sugar estate was then modernized with new railroad track and plantings. By 1887 it produced 4,000 tons of sugar, and by 1888 Elisha Atkins had acquired the Bay State refinery in Boston. Having begun as an intermediary between Cuban planters and U.S. refiners, the firm of E. Atkins became a "vertically integrated" company owning all the means of production, from the raw material and plantations in Cuba, to the Boston refinery in the United States.<lb/>
<lb/>
During the War of Independence (1895–98) insurgents decimated the sugar industry, and subsequently the United States acquired Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. Although Cuba gained independence in 1902, it remained under the tutelage of the United States, and North American sugar refiners gained easy access and control over much of the Cuban raw sugar industry. Increasingly, sugar refiners were joined by directors and members of banking institutions in controlling the sugar industry. Two of the most prominent United States banking houses involved were the House of Morgan and the National City Bank of New York. Complex holding companies were created to facilitate this practice.<lb/>
<lb/>
During World War I, as the production of Central European beet sugar declined, Cuban cane prices skyrocketed, and a second wave of growth in the Cuban sugar industry took place. This period of prosperity, known as the Danza de Los Milliones, brought increased investment in sugar. The National City Bank of New York provided loans to construct more mills for sugarcane production, as well as to finance the new "colonos," or small farmers who cultivated cane. Twenty-two new NCB branches opened in Cuba in 1919 and one in 1920. U.S.-owned Centrales—large sugar estates—were built in the undeveloped provinces of Camaguey and Oriente in the eastern part of Cuba. However, in 1921, as European beet sugar recovered, the price of Cuban sugar plummeted, and only large U.S.-owned Centrales survived. E. Atkins's Punta Alegre Sugar Company was one of these.<lb/>
<lb/>
In 1927 Mary C. Rentschler married Gordon S. Rentschler. Her first marriage to Edwin F. Atkins Jr. had ended in 1923 when her husband, their two young sons, and nanny, died in a plane crash off the coast of Cuba. She was the only family survivor. Pregnant at the time, she gave birth to a daughter, Faith Atkins Witter, on July 2, 1923. Mary C. Rentschler maintained a strong attachment to her mother-in-law and Cuba after she was widowed and remarried.<lb/>
<lb/>
Gordon S. Rentschler was the son of George Adam Rentschler. Born in 1846 in Germany, George arrived in Newark, New Jersey, circa 1849–52. There he apprenticed as a molder and pattern maker for seven years from the age of eleven to eighteen. In 1864 he moved to Peru, Indiana, where he worked as a molder for a small plant. In 1875 he founded the firm of Sohn, Rentschler &amp; Balle. A year later Balle withdrew, and Henry Sohn &amp; George Adam Rentschler established the Ohio Iron Works and the Phoenix Caster Company. The Ohio Iron Works was the nucleus of subsequent Rentschler ventures. In 1892 he founded the Hamilton Foundry &amp; Machine Company to produce castings. Ten years earlier, in 1882, the Hooven Owens Rentschler Company was formed. This company manufactured Corliss engines, marine engines, and sugar mill equipment. By 1913 Rentschler's factory housed the largest Corliss engine works in the world, and their marine engines were used in World War I. These engines produced a large part of the power used at the St. Louis World's Fair, as well as the energy for the Ford Motor Car Company power plant.<lb/>
<lb/>
Twenty-seven "representative industries" are described in Hamilton's local newspaper, underscoring its position as a booming iron and steel town. It was home to the Beckett Paper Company, Champion Coated Paper Company, Mosler Safe Company, the Estate Stove Company, as well as factories producing farm equipment, knitting mills, and elevators. Also located in Hamilton was the Cincinnati Brewing Company, owned by George A. Rentschler's father-in-law, Peter Schwab. His beer, "Schwab's Pure Gold," was distributed nationwide.<lb/>
<lb/>
On March 25, 1913, Hamilton, Ohio suffered a record flood. The town was submerged and a relief committee was created. Gordon S. Rentschler was appointed Chairman of the Miami Conservancy District Board, dedicated to the prevention of further floods. The <emph render="italic">Daily Republican News</emph> magazine of 1913 reported that the Hooven-Owens-Rentschler factory "saved the City of Hamilton from . . . disaster. The magnificent buildings, consisting of the foundry and machine shops, stood strong, as a mighty bulwark, against the onrushing waters." Gordon Rentschler worked closely with another member of the committee of the Miami Conservancy Board, Colonel Edward A. Deeds, executive of National Cash Register. In 1917 Rentschler became managing director of the Hooven Owens Rentschler Company, and in 1918 he became involved with NCB through his work with Charles E. Mitchell, Chairman, on a bond issue for the Miami, Ohio flood control program. Through Rentschler's business contacts as a producer of heavy sugar mill machinery, he visited Soledad, the Atkin's plantation in Cuba, and he became a friend of the Atkins family. Rentschler had sugar interests of his own in Cuba, and in 1921 he sought to recover debts owed him by Cuban planters. In his capacity as specialist in Cuban sugar and sugar mill machinery, he was hired by National City Bank Chairman Charles E. Mitchell to survey the bank's sugar properties and decide if they could be successfully overhauled and made profitable. He and Colonel E. A. Deeds traveled to Cuba in July 1921. Their report supported further investment in Cuban sugar. They believed that the industry would ultimately generate revenues to repay the bank's loans and turn a profit. However, this positive assessment proved incorrect. Efforts by the Cuban government failed to resuscitate the sugar industry, and the unforeseen 1929 stock market crash further weakened the industry. In 1933 revolution swept Cuba: rural and urban workers took over mills and overthrew the dictator Gerardo Machado. A nationalist government led by Ramon Grau San Martin took power. He was overthrown in a coup in January 1934 led by Fulgencio Batista.<lb/>
<lb/>
National City Bank had a long history in Cuba. In 1837 Moses Taylor (president, 1856–1882) was heavily involved in trading Cuban sugar. In 1898, when the United States acquired Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Spanish American War, NCB president James Stillman helped underwrite a $200 million loan to finance the war. By 1931, years of investment in Cuba, coupled with the stock market crash, left the bank exposed to money advances and loans to Cuba worth $79 million, or 80 percent of the bank's capital. Government blamed the economic downturn on the banking industry's speculative practices and wide unregulated powers. In 1931 and 1933 Charles Mitchell, chairman of National City Bank, testified in front of the Senate Banking Committee in Washington, where he came under heavy fire for irresponsible banking practices. As a result, the government created the Banking Act of 1933, separating commercial and investment banking and thereby limiting the risk to which each bank was exposed. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board assumed greater power in controlling the amount and use of credit. In February 1933 Charles E. Mitchell resigned, and James H. Perkins, President of National City Bank's City Bank Farmers Trust Company succeeded him. The practical result for National City Bank was the liquidation of National City Company (securities division) and a return to a policy of "ready money." In addition, NCB closed unprofitable international branches, including twelve in Cuba. The bank now sought to lend to corporations that had excellent business prospects.<lb/>
<lb/>
Gordon S. Rentschler rose through the ranks of National City Bank. In 1923 he was the youngest member on the bank's board of directors; in 1925 he was elected a vice president and assistant to President Charles Mitchell; in 1929 he was elected president; in 1940 he succeeded Perkins as chairman of the bank. Rentschler continued Perkins' return to conservative banking policy, and with his vice-chairman W. Randolph Burgess, he helped the Treasury sell bills and bonds to finance the war. In 1941 Rentschler toured the country, reassuring corporate clients that the bank would help them once the war ended. Rentschler and Burgess succeeded in restoring the bank's reputation. National City Bank branches were rebuilt after the war as the United States enjoyed an inflationary boom, however, the memory of the boom and bust economy that followed World War I produced a sense of unease, and Rentschler worked cautiously to rebuild the bank until his death in 1948.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>Mary Coolidge Rentschler and Helen Rentschler Waldon appear to have collected personal and family papers throughout their lives (1892–1988 and 1890–1967 respectively). The bulk of the documents in this manuscript collection date from 1875–1950 (inclusive dates are 1793–2000). Approximately sixteen and a half linear feet of materials were received by Susan Rentschler Witter (Mary C. Rentschler's daughter and Helen R. Waldon's niece). These included minutes, wills, mortgages, correspondence, scrapbooks, publications, press clippings, memorabilia, blueprints, maps, photographic albums, loose photographic prints, and negatives.<lb/>
<lb/>
The paper collection is housed in twenty-four manuscript boxes comprising ten linear feet of material. Oversized (non-photographic) documents, including legal agreements, maps, certificates, architectural drawings, and a lithograph, were transferred to three oversized horizontal storage boxes and two cylinders. Materials such as publications, diaries, in memoriam tributes, and 3-D artifacts and memorabilia were removed to 58 bully boxes of varying sizes. Photographic prints were transferred to fifteen print storage boxes and oversized images were transferred to three oversize print storage boxes and one cylinder. Photographic albums and framed photographs were placed in 12 boxes / archival photo albums. Negatives were removed to nine bully boxes.<lb/>
<lb/>
The majority of the material is in good condition. However, eleven documents [Diary (1904); Diary (1912); Diary (1915); Wedding guest book (1927); Illuminated Pamphlets (1948); Corning Glass Works; Anaconda Copper Mining Co.; Citibank; Home Insurance Company; Consolidated Edison; Princeton University] suffered severe flood damage at Mary C. Rentschler's home at 770 Park Avenue and required professional cleaning and care by a paper conservator [Ms. Ursula Mitra)]. The archivist cleaned less severely damaged correspondence. A micro-particle vacuum cleaner was used to remove mold.<lb/>
<lb/>
The materials came from two main locations. From the Rentschler home in New York came two record storage boxes and two metal blanket boxes containing predominantly David Hill Coolidge, Mary C. Rentschler, and Gordon S. Rentschler materials. From the Gordon Rentschler farm in Hamilton, Ohio, came two metal suitcases containing Rentschler family materials as well as Helen R. Waldon records. Although the records came from two different physical locations they were all the collection of Mary C. Rentschler. As such they form one series of material. Within this there are five groups denoting the five individuals that form the subject matter of the collection: David Hill Coolidge, Mary C. Rentschler, Gordon S. Rentschler, Helen R. Waldon, and Susan R. Witter. Materials were found arranged by type, e.g., personal correspondence, scrapbooks, photographs. There was little chronological order.</p>  </scopecontent>

David Hill Coolidge Sr. (1833–1907) [DHC]</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_93bbdf8454cd62e2874c6eafefc416c6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>These materials include wills, mortgages, correspondence, diaries, scrapbooks, and commission certificates mostly dating from the second half of the nineteenth century. They reflect both a huge pride and love for his family and a prominent standing and involvement in the legal profession and civic life.<lb/>
<lb/>
Coolidge's papers include a large number of documents concerning his immediate and ancestral family. Numerous genealogies, obituaries, and historical letters written by distant family members attest to his interest and pride in the accomplishments of his family. The oldest documents in the entire collection are among these materials, they are a promissory note and mortgage dated 1793 and 1796, respectively. The realty document for a property on Milk Street in Boston belonged to his grandfather David Hill (Box Ovz-1). Other items of note include a copy of the will of his maternal grandfather, David Hill (1837 March 8), as well as an abstract of the will of his paternal grandfather, Jonas Coolidge (1860 March 16) (Box Man-2, Folder 5).<lb/>
<lb/>
Three scrapbooks include invitations and press clippings surrounding events involving Coolidge's immediate family. Loose correspondence contained in the scrapbooks was removed to adjacent file folders. Among the correspondence are letters concerning the betrothal of his sons David H. Coolidge, Jr. to Harriet S. Crowninshield, and Frederick S. Coolidge to Elizabeth Sprague. Elizabeth Sprague's mother writes poignantly of her anxiety over separating from her daughter (Box Man-1, Folder 6). Correspondence from his son, David H. Coolidge, Jr., in the Caribbean in 1898 provides a glimpse of life there at the time of the Spanish-American War. The young Coolidge complains of his wife's extravagance (Box Man-1, Folder 3).<lb/>
<lb/>
Civic involvement is attested to by the twenty commission certificates spanning from 1858 to 1906. These include appointments as Justice of the Peace, master of Chancery, and Commissioner of Insolvency in Massachusetts, as well as Commissioner for the States of Maine and Michigan, and membership of the Board of Trustees of the Hospital Cottages for Children in Boston (Box Ovz-1 and Ovz-2). Coolidge's three scrapbooks are filled with press clippings of local civic news, as well as domestic and foreign affairs. For example: a report of the battle of Gettysburg; an electricity exhibition conceived of by Coolidge and George S. Hale; administration of Boston's City Hospital with an item petitioning admission of female students; judicial abuses in Italy (Box Man-1, Folder 4). Finally, letters he received from Congressman W. W. Warren in 1875 and 1876 indicate firsthand knowledge of Washington politics. The letters discuss currency and the gold standard, as well as impeachment, corruption, and electioneering (Box Man-2, Folder 7).<lb/>
<lb/>
The scrapbooks contain an eclectic group of materials. Aside from those previously mentioned, other items of interest include: a tiny and beautiful notebook of his scholastic record at his alma mater, Harvard University (Box Man-2, Folder 10); programs and press clippings concerning Arlington Street Unitarian Church to which he belonged (Box Man-2, Folder 15); a silk menu (Box Man-1, Folder 3); a handwritten poem to him on his seventeenth birthday, with miniscule photographs of women attached (Box Man-2, Folder 11); innumerable printed poems (Box Man-3, Folder 2), and a bill of safe passage for himself and R. C. Billings in the Civil War south (Box Man-1, Folder 4). (Billings became a very successful Boston businessman.)<lb/>
<lb/>
His diverse interests and the papers he chose to keep reflect a civic-minded and successful Bostonian and provide a wealth of information from which to create a family genealogy.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_f59a5e2f6a7994e9f8f1f56275541a89" level="file"><did><unittitle>Promissory note and mortgage</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1793 February 20-1826 May 9</unitdate><container id="aspace_b39e1dd4c17fb305ea7541282f15b6b7" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">Ovz-1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_da4809dab7292ef2e5684e48215eceff"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Promissory note and mortgage, Milk Street property, David Hill, 1793-1796, and Indenture between Pratt &amp; Hill, 1826, Boston, Massachusetts.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_5ff1bac33159c219478ab380496bc0ca" level="file"><did><unittitle>U.S. War Dept.

The bulk of the written material falls into five main categories: early correspondence and documents, including love letters from Charles A. Coolidge to Julia S. Coolidge (1874–1900); diaries and correspondence from Mary's youth and marriage to Edwin F. Atkins, Jr. (1904–1923); general correspondence and love letters between Mary C. Rentschler and Gordon S.

<emph render="underline">Correspondence, 1874–1900</emph><lb/>
<lb/>
In October 1889 Charles A. Coolidge married the sister of George Foster Shepley, one of the original partners of the architectural firm of Shepley Rutan and Coolidge. The love letters from Charles A. Coolidge to Julia Shepley written from February to April 1889 provide insight into a passionate and creative man and a leader in the field of architectural design.<lb/>
<lb/>
His passion for art and architecture runs through the correspondence. He read Burkhardt and books about the Italian Renaissance over American literature (1889 March 20; Box Man-4, Folder 1), and describes sketching a Turner painting hanging opposite his bed (1889 March 15; Box Man-3, Folder 22). his firm was busy with many architectural commissions, including the Ames building (the first skyscraper in Boston), and Boston's Trinity Church: "I am going to take up the porch and front of Trinity Church and see if I cannot put it through as I do not know of anything that would be more of an improvement to the City" (1889 April 5; Box Man-4, Folder 1); and Stanford University in California "I spent all day with the Governor and Mrs. Stanford and I think we have finally settled the dormitory. Mrs. S. wanted to talk about you &amp; the engagement &amp; kept interrupting the business talk; you would have been amused and angry at the same time. . ." (1889 April 7; Box Man-4, Folder 1).<lb/>
<lb/>
In another letter he writes "Mr. Olmsted telegraphed me today that the Governor will be here" (1889 April 3; Box Man-4, Folder 1). This was, perhaps, Frederick Law Olmsted. The letters suggest a lack of bureaucracy surrounding the construction of so many important buildings, and reflect Coolidge's pivotal involvement in creating the urban landscape of his day.<lb/>
<lb/>
His letters are filled with yearning for Julia and a desire for a meaningful relationship (1889 February 27; Box Man-3, Folder 22; and 1889 March 19; Box Man-4, Folder 1). The letters convey an enormous respect, however their passion is not colored by sentimentality. On the contrary, it is the straightforward, almost "modern" quality of the correspondence that is most striking. Although we do not have Julia's letters, the responses in his letters suggest that she is less certain of marriage than he is. In a reply as to whether or not he would take care of her in her old age he says of course, and "as for your having always hated the idea of passing long, long years with one person, I should think that was an argument why you should now make up your mind to leave your mother" (1889 April 3; Box Man-4, Folder 1). He morbidly jokes that with all the traveling he makes to visit her she will soon have her freedom as a young widow, implying that he will die of exhaustion. In another letter he writes "cheer up dear you are not [to] be married yet never if you do not want to be and you need not be married for 'all your life' as you can kill me off very easily afterwards if you want to. Saturday Eve" (1889 circa April 5; Box Man-4, Folder 1).<lb/>
<lb/>
This candid attitude reverberates throughout his letters. He is forthright in his dismissal of frivolous socializing and heaps scorn on the temperance movement:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"I have been holding forth on the false name and position of these temperance people, in the first place no sensible person can help acknowledging that temperance means a moderate &amp; uninjurious use of whatever food or liquid that you may be discussing &amp; when a total abolitionist objects to be called that &amp; says he is simply promoting temperance I feel like telling him he is a liar" (1889 April 8; Box Man-4, Folder 1).</p></blockquote>

<emph render="underline">Correspondence, 1904–1923</emph><lb/>
<lb/>
The second group of documents amongst the Mary C. Rentschler material is the diaries and correspondence of her youth and first marriage to Edwin F. Atkins, Jr. (1904–1923). Mary C. Rentschler's diaries span from 1904–1917 (from twelve to twenty-five years of age). Covering her childhood in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, to her life in Cuba as a young bride, they provide a glimpse of Boston's youthful high society in 1915 and the life of a young bride and expatriate in Cuba two years later. In 1917 her husband joined the signal corps preparing for action in World War I France. The letters from the soldier to his parents as well as from Mary to her mother-in-law provide descriptions of army life. Finally, the death of Edwin F. Atkins, Jr. and the two sons is recorded in condolence letters to Charles A. Coolidge, Sr. in 1923.<lb/>
<lb/>
Mary Rentschler's 1915 diary indicates a life focused on theatre engagements and her fiancé, Edwin F. Atkins, Jr. (Box Man-4, Folder 4). What appears is a headstrong young woman who by 1917 is married and pregnant and is thoroughly enjoying the adventure of life in Cuba. The diaries and letters concerning Cuba provide wonderful primary source material of life as the wife of a North American sugar planter. They document the political and social upheaval of the times, as well as the domestic life of a plantation. Mary C. Rentschler describes the arson, robberies, shootings, and kidnapping of a colleague (Mr. Van Petten) that the Atkins plantations endured during various insurrections. New of visits by senior United States officials to Soledad underscore Edwin F. Atkins Sr.'s prominent position. In an entry in her diary Mar C. Rentschler notes: "Heigh-ho, it's a funny family in a funny country. But we are all so pleased that the troops are sent &amp; that it was Pa [Edwin F. Atkins, Sr.] who sent them!" (1917 March 9; Box Man-4, Folder 7). (The troops are United States forces sent to protect North American property.) The anxiety of the events is overcome by a great sense of adventure: "Grand excitement! Yesterday Pa received a letter from Bob [probably Robert Atkins] saying they had received order from rebs. to stop grinding &amp; notification that the cane would be burned &amp; mill blown up. Pa &amp; Ma planned to leave this a.m. for P.A. [Punta Alegre]" (1917 March 6). Soledad is full of conversation about Cuban politics and the blundering and corrupt presidencies of Jose Miguel Gomez and General Mario Menocal (the former was president 1909–1913, the latter, 1913–1921).<lb/>
<lb/>
Amid the chaos in 1917 she writes about the surge in sugar production: "We had a record run last week. Not one engine was stopped from the time it started till we stopped at 7 p.m. last night. It's never been done here before. The week before we stopped only once for 15 minutes. Isn't that pretty good?" (1917 February 26; Box Man-4, Folder 5). The texts corroborate this period as one of thriving industry despite the political upheavals. Her descriptions of sounds, people, and life in Soledad are beautifully evocative; she pens her letters to the noise of the sugar mill and a bustling household, which included her mother-in-law, Ma (Katherine W. Atkins), her father-in-law, Pa (E.F.A., Sr.), her sister-in-law and brother-in-law, Helen and Bill (Claflin), Mr. Hughes (plantation manager), and her sister, Julia (Coolidge Deane). When Rentschler is not writing of attacks on the batey (the village around the sugar mill) she describes the sewing classes that she and her mother-in-law give, as well as the movies and parties and horse riding expeditions. However, by 1921, the tone has altered. In a letter to Edwin F. Atkins, Sr., Mary write: "The atmosphere seems to be rather that of 'the morning after,' everyone awake again to the cold reality of life after the rosy colors of the last two years." (Saturday, 1921?; Box Man-4, Folder 13). The price of sugar has plummeted and will never fully recover.<lb/>

<lb/>
The love letters of Mary C. Rentschler and Gordon S. Rentschler are passionate and powerful. The letters offer an empathetic portrait of Gordon Rentschler providing a tender and intimate portrayal of a man at the heart of American big business. Mary gratefully acknowledges a letter from Gordon on the first anniversary of the death of her original family, January 1924: "You know, Gordon, you are the only one, except his mother, who ever speaks to me of Ted. To have him dropped out so completely is almost the hardest part of all" (1924 January 2; Box Man-4, Folder 17). His sensitivity to her personal loss and the acknowledgement of her past are very much appreciated by her. He appears to recognize the symbiotic relationship between mother and daughter and sensitively appeals to the adoration Mary has for her child: "Faith is even better than we always think she is. I wish Ted could see her, as he would be delighted with her. I can almost see his eyes dance and hear his great laugh as he would play with her" (1925 November 1; Box Man-5, Folder 4).<lb/>
<lb/>
Their letters are full of the details of daily life. Mary describes life on the plantation in Cuba and on holiday in Marion, Massachusetts, and Gordon describes the world of high finance that he moves in. On a whirlwind business tour of Europe in the summer of 1925, Gordon describes staying at the Hotel Ritz in Barcelona: "tell Faith that my room has a big Russian Bath which one gets into by walking down three steps and when it is all full of water a girl as big as xx could take a good swim in it. It is my first experience with such a luxury so I played in it like any other farmer boy would" (undated; Box Man-5, Folder 3). His letters provide a tantalizing glimpse at the world of high finance and high society in the 1920s. At a dinner at the Ritz Hotel in New York Gordon writes: "Alex Moore of Spanish Ambassador fame and Charlie Chaplin ate next door to us and bickered back and forth between courses, and nearby sat Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte—nice but the water is too deeply mixed with the wine of one-time greatness" (1927 June 8; Box Man-8, Folder 4). Indeed, his correspondence indicates a firsthand knowledge of international politics:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"Charlie Mitchell [NCB Chairman] and I had a pleasant time bickering and dining and then gossiping with Averell Harriman about his dealings with the Russian Bolsheviks in his new xx in Georgia. He seems to have his things all set well, but I question how well any of us can get on with the Bolsheviks in their present frame of mind" (1925 June 19; Box Man-5, Folder 2).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
By March 1927, four months before their marriage, Mary's letters have become familiar, tender, and humorous. Gordon writes to Mary of a dinner he attended with Kerensky and Mary replies:<lb/> 
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"There are moments when I do wish I were a man, to be in on such like meetings. There are so few people who will give a woman credit for owning any brains &amp; using them, or being interested in anything but clothes, houses, or babies! That's one of the nice things about <emph render="underline">you</emph>, you do. One of the best compliments I ever had paid me, was when one of Ted's friends heaved a sigh &amp; said 'Isn't it great to be out with just a bunch of fellows!' (Me being the only lady present.) On the other hand there are moments when I would not be a man for anything—unless you were a lady—which really stretches the imagination further than it will go" (1927 March 29; Box Man-6, Folder 6).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
Her love for "my Man," as she address him, is wholeheartedly reciprocated; Gordon writes to her in Cuba from his home at 933 Fifth Avenue, New York:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"Tonight again I've watched the moon come over the park. It's a great moon here but of course not like it is sifting through xx palm trees because some where beyond the palms is my Mary, lovely happy and gay . . . as I watch this moon night after night I see my own little Mary. And some times she seems so very close. But always she is the same wonderful girl, lovely, sensible human" (1927 March 19; Box Man-6, Folder 8).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
The reader is left with an image of a man utterly in love, who displays an almost childlike pleasure at his good fortune and who is enormously grateful for the opportunities that have been presented to him. Mary, raised in a sophisticated New England home, displays a level-headedness and personal fortitude that enable her to create a new life with the man from Ohio. "On the whole I'm glad my future doesn't seem to be about to include the spending of the rest of my life with a dyed-in-the-wool &amp; never-exported Bostonian" (Wed. eve., 1927; Box Man-6, Folder 6).<lb/>
<lb/>
<emph render="underline">Correspondence, 1927–1974</emph><lb/>
<lb/>
The majority of this correspondence is to Mary C. Rentschler, from Katherine W. Atkinks, Julia C. Deane, and Isabel Coolidge. Other significant letters were written by Llewelyn (Daddy) Hughes, Julia S. Coolidge, and Faith A. Witter. The bulk of the material was written from 1929 to 1941. The letters bear witness to the flamboyance of the 1920s and the subsequent Depression. We read about Gordon's appearance in Senate hearings in Washington, D.C., Cuba's self-imposed cane production quotas, and the approach of war. The letters, particularly those of Daddy Hughes and Katherine W. Atkins in Cuba, provide wonderful firsthand knowledge of a country suffering from poverty and the legacy of colonial domination. But above all we learn about the daily lives of Mary and her family.<lb/>
<lb/>
Faith A. Witter, Mary's third child, is a seminal character within Mary's correspondence and life. The collection contains a diary of Faith's progress from the age of nine months to four years of age, written by the child's nanny, Mary Goode McLaughlin, as well as many of her daughter's letters (Box Man-4, Folder 16). [The file containing McLaughlin's notes is contained in the 1923–1927 group of materials.] Mary frequently wrote about her children's progress, and in particular about her feelings for Faith:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"I am glad you find her sweet, for, to me, of course, she is unique. She is so much a part of me that I really cannot express myself intelligently—We frequently read each others' thoughts &amp; when she is by me there is a contentment that nothing else brings. I couldn't bear for you not to like her rather especially" (Long Island, 1929; Box Man-9, Folder 11).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
In another letter written that summer to her mother-in-law, Katherine Atkins, Mary writes again of Faith. In this letter a powerful image is drawn of a life of ease for America's affluent society:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p> "Charlie Mitchell &amp; Sloan Colt arrived off Charlie's vessel, chartered for the summer, &amp; ate us out of house &amp; home. . . I am going into town tomorrow—like Adelina Pati, for the 'last time.' Each time I swear I'll not go again &amp; then I get so bored &amp; so many things need doing, that I have to go—This time a wedding present for young Margaret Sims, and, very important but what I'd <emph render="underline">entirely</emph> forgotten, some furniture for the new infants' nursery. . . There goes Webb, exercising Mr. Cravath's horse. I expect he'll be glad to have his Miss Chatterbox back. He found it much more amusing dragging Popcorn &amp; the conversational Faith on a leading rein, than going alone—We are suffering from a most objectionable son of a most objectionable father. The son is learning to fly &amp; he flies right over our chimneys all day long. . ." (Summer 1929? Tuesday, Long Island; Box Man-9, Folder 11). [Adelina Pati might be a reference to the diva Adelina Patti, a singer from Wales who was a superstar of the second half of the 19th century.]</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
Charles Mitchell, the Chairman of National City Bank, and Gordon's mentor, arrives for dinner by boat to their Locust Valley home on Long Island; Mary is so bored she goes to town to shop; Cravath, of the law firm of Paul Cravath, lives next door, and the Rentschler's groom leads Faith around on her horse named Popcorn; in addition, a neighbor's son practices his flying lessons overhead.<lb/>
<lb/>
By the fall/winter of 1929 the situation has changed:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"C.W.A. has just laid off 40% of its workers. Much of its last appropriation has to go for back pay, I understand. It is a ghastly mess—and all the money which might have kept us going for two or three years—spent &amp; nothing but debts in its place. . . I can hardly keep my mind off it what these people who have to say 'no' all day go through makes me shiver. On the other hand you get so annoyed with people who have lived &amp; worked here 30 years &amp; never paid a tax or taken out citizenship papers even. Well—fortunately we are having a meeting of our local committee tomorrow—our <emph render="underline">private</emph> unemployment Comm.—not C.W.A." (Friday Locust Valley, NY, Fall/Winter 1929; Box Man-9, Folder 11).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
The disastrous economic condition of the country, although acknowledged and bemoaned in the letters, does not appear to affect the family materially. Details of family life continue with news of birthdays, sickness, parties, and vacations. Mary writes to Katherine from the Moisie River Fishing Club in Quebec, Canada, where the family loved to vacation. Referring to Faith, Mary writes: "She has Gordon right under her thumb—he is very weak minded. He loved her before but since Phoebe has been talking &amp; calling him "Daddy" Faith—very tentatively at first—tried it, &amp; that completely finished his subjugation" (1931 July 10; Box Man-10, Folder 7).<lb/>
<lb/>
By 1933 the banking scandals are seeping into the correspondence and provide evidence of the agony that Gordon Rentschler suffered. Mary writes to her mother-in-law in Belmont, Massacusetts, from New York's Savoy Plaza:<lb/>
<lb/>
 <blockquote><p>". . . if it only weren't for the hurt of the injustice to Charlie &amp; Hugh. It is sort of like the war—if you were there, there is no need to explain &amp; if you weren't there is no use trying to explain the feelings &amp; experiences of that kind of an investigation by a group of men—a jury maybe?—who have already said 'guilty' (February 1933; Box Man-10, Folder 9).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
The sometimes strained letters from her family in North America are in contrast to the letters from the Atkins plantation in Cuba of the same period. The correspondence reflects a life divided between a love of Cuba and her native home in North America. In March of 1933, shortly after the birth of her daughter Susan Helen, she received the following letter from "Daddy" [Llewelyn] Hughes, the plantation manager:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"My dear Mary, We were all delighted at hearing from you, it is fine that you and little Susan Helen are getting on so well. Gordon was very kind, as he always is, in sending us the cable and you may be sure we were all so glad to hear that everything was well. Mummy &amp; I are 'thinking' of returning north but so far we have not got beyond that stage, it is so lovely here, we have had a few showers and the fields are turning green once more. Spring time in Cuba and particularly in Soledad cannot be beaten, the nights &amp; early mornings are cool even if the days are a bit hot. How happy we'd be if conditions were better— Our crop came to a forced stop last Friday, we had finished our quota, 53,000 bags, only three years in the last 40 has Soledad had such a small crop, they were 1896, '97 &amp; '98. The revolution days, and even then we made over 47,000 bags and a profit! In 1893 Soledad made 56,164 and went to nearly 70,000 the next year—well, it is no use worrying over spilt milk, we must see what can be done for the future. Things certainly look brighter than a year ago and we all feel encouraged, even though we cannot step-out much this summer. Our trouble here is that we have so very little work for the people, we have not finished cutting the fields that were not cut in 1932, so cannot do much field work as, I suppose, we will have another restricted crop in 1934, for 1935 Soledad and everyone else that is still in the ring will have to prepare a crop of moderate proportions. My guess is that nobody will go wild planting for some years. I hope not anyway. I have given Bill Leonard your message about the Beef, he will attend to it and many thanks Mary on behalf of the poor people that will get one square meal that day. It surprises me that the country people are as well as they certainly look. There has been some difficulty about clothes &amp; shoes but Mrs. Atkins has done a lot and I don't believe there has been any real hunger, at least on Soledad, these early rains will allow people to get in their corn &amp; other plantings a month earlier than last year. You would be astonished to see the amount of stuff that is grown by the work? people and if they only keep it up after conditions improve the depression will have done much good, it has always been so difficult to get people to plant for themselves as you will remember. Sincerely yours, Daddy Hughes" (1933 April 11; Box Man-10, Folder 12).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
This letter beautifully evokes the arrival of spring in Cuba as well as the growing economic and political crisis that by August would become a Revolution. The figures provide useful statistics to measure sugar cane production. The restricted crop refers to the quotas on sugar manufacture, the result of government efforts to stem the falling price of sugar.<lb/>
<lb/>
Daddy Hughes and Katherine W. Atkins wrote descriptive accounts of Cuba from 1933–1941. In a letter written in April 1938 Hughes expresses his concern that family-run plantations will disappear as Government-run organizations will take over the sugar industry. In response to a request as to what Mary can do to help rural women, he suggests teaching them hygiene and childcare. He also suggests paying to transport children to the church schools in the local large town of Cienfuegos as the local government schools are unsatisfactory. We read that as Cuban law prohibited the employment of children under the age of sixteen and children finished school at about fourteen years of age, the estate might hire teachers to instruct the children for the interim. After all, the boys who were "running wild" would be their "future workmen" (1938 April 19; Box Man-10, Folder 12).<lb/>
<lb/>
The rural poverty is even more evident in the letters of Katherine W. Atkins. Her in-depth descriptions provide a dramatic, clear picture:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"I was told in fact the grandmother who is the caretaker in the school begged me for shoes for the family of her son. The men told me they were no good, had had shoes and didn't come then so I went up to the house to investigate. They live in the last house on the ridge as you go out to the crossing. There was the sickest baby there you ever saw the head looked like a skull with the skin drawn over it and one leg was swelled to double its size with what looked like a gigantic water blister. Four other children, a small girl and three older boys, the house a mess and a big plank gone from the porch. Slack beyond words of course but could you blame them, they say he is always empanado in the store and as soon as he gets out of debt there is a bill for medicine. Mr. Mackenzie spoke as if he blamed him for that but what can the poor people do. I saw at least four bottles of patent medicine and baby food in the house, I would do it myself if my baby was ill. . . .the doctor is coming to inject the whole school for typhoid this morning so Good bye lessons and I think sewing class, last week when they had the first injection they were 'fainting and writhing in coils' all over the Batey poor little things. . . . One old nig, one of the two or three very old ones had her house blown down in the cyclone. I don't know why they promised to rebuild that house (there were two living in it then) as it was in Cienfuegos but they apparently did. Before it was begun one died and the other one has been here at intervals ever since. I though she wanted a place at Rosario where she is now living with her daughter and the other day we met up with Fernando while she was talking and much to my surprise he offered to take her to the store with my vale and then told her he could see to the house. Yesterday he denied having ever told her anything when asked by Bill or Wilfrid I am not sure of many things but I know I heard him tell her he would fix it for I was greatly surprised. We may get something for her later" (1940 March 13, Wednesday; Box Man-10, Folder 12).
</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
The letters remain interspersed with news of the family. The letters reveal that Mary and Gordon assisted many members of their family when the occasion arose. Julia C. Deane enlisted her sister's help when Isabel needed medical assistance (1936 January 18; Box Man-9, Folder 12). Mary collected correspondence that was written to her by her children and the collection contains a large number of letters written from 1935 to 1947 by Faith, Phoebe, Mary (Mimi), and Susan. In 1938 Faith went on a summer vacation to the Diamond G. Ranch in Dubois, Wyoming. A wonderful glimpse of the young elite is provided by Faith's letters home from her vacation. In addition, there are interesting letters from the children's aunt and uncle, Helen and Sidney Waldon, with whom they often stayed for summer holidays. In one instance, Sidney write:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"Yesterday I saw Sue putting the dice in the box with the 1's upward. She would then shake the box sideways so as not to disturb the arrangement, and then upend the box so that she had double 6's. She varied the technique by sometimes using double 3's or 5's. Naturally she beat her sisters all to pieces. Later on she confided to me that if she used that trick with other people it would be cheating, but of course it was quite all right in playing against Mimi and Phoebe who are so much larger than she" (1939 July 14; Box Man-11, Folder 8).
</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
The arrival of war barely changes the tone or content of the letters in the collection, with the exception of Katherine Atkins, who remarks on war work and takes an interest in the news:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>". . . the Duponts came over in the morning for breakfast, they wanted to go to the Garden but a heavy shower came up right after breakfast and they concluded to go home for fear they could not get there later. . . .The Radio news that we can get is most disturbing, the only consolation is that it may not be true, peace with Finland, Turkey wavering toward Germany, the Balkans forced to throw in their lot with Russia, England torn by internal dissension, and only Sumner Welles to stem the tide" (1940 March 13; Box Man-10, Folder 12). [The Duponts were manufacturers of munitions. Edwin F. Atkins, Sr. created a garden in 1901 near the Soledad plantation to study sugarcane. The garden was donated to Harvard University in 1919 and operated by them until after the U.S. embargo was imposed in 1961. Sumner Welles (1892–1961) was an American diplomat. In 1940 Welles was the Undersecretary of State and took part in the mid-Atlantic meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt. In 1933 he was unable to mediate an agreement between the opposing groups in the revolution against Gerardo Machado in Cuba.]</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
Other correspondence of interest includes: a fascinating travel diary by Benjamin Clapp, 1811–1812 (Box Man-13, Folder 6); a letter from Dr. Josephine Kenyon, Mary's doctor, recommending thyroid medication, exercise, and painting (1938 February 4; Box Man-11, Folder 7); letters from Charles A. Coolidge, Jr. and Julia C. Deane describing a September 1938 storm that hit the northeast coast of the United States (Box Man-11, Folder 6); correspondence from Mary to Gordon from Helen Waldon's home in Michigan, upon the death of Sidney D. Waldon in January 1945 (Box Man-12, Folder 10); correspondence to and from Frederick B. Rentschler, a founder of the Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft company and Gordon Rentschler's brother (1948–1956; Box Man-12, Folder 14); a letter sent from Cuba by Helen Claflin describing the dangers of childbirth in that country in 1958 (Box Man-13, Folder 4); finally, individual letters from Winston Churchill's secretary (Box 12, Folder 16), J. C. Penney (Box Man-13, Folder 3), and Bernard Baruch (Box Man-12, Folder 15).<lb/>

<emph render="underline">Genealogical material</emph>
<lb/>
Genealogical materials related to Mary Rentschler's branch of the family, i.e., Atkins, Carleton, Coolidge, Shepley, Shurtleff, have been amassed at the end of Subseries I.B materials. Folders 2 and 8 in Box Man-14 originated with the David H. Coolidge, Sr. materials and were added to these records for ease of access.<lb/>
<lb/>
These materials provide biographical materials necessary to construct the family tree and chronological information on the family. Box Man-14, Folder 11, contains a photographic copy of an essay written by Louise Lionberger Amory (no date) about summer vacations at the turn of the 19th century in Marion, Massachusetts, at the home of Mary Augusta Clapp Shepley (also known as Ama), Mary C.

Rentschler death paper and genealogical materials that originated in New York. However, the death papers are listed separately within Series III.<lb/>
<lb/>
The materials include minutes, business records, personal correspondence, certificates, diplomas, news clippings, memorabilia, photographic prints, and maps. They are a disparate body of documents, lacking in in-depth information. There is a dearth of material produced by Rentschler himself. However, when viewed in their entirety they provide a picture of a man from a successful mid-western family who entered the world of high finance and rose to the top of his profession as a result of unyielding hard work.<lb/>
<lb/>
The business documents include minutes of the George A. Rentschler Company from 1925–1944 (Box Man-14, Folder 13–15), as well as a letter written in 1885 concerning the company's castor patent (Box Man-14, Folder 20). The growth and scope of the Rentschler foundry is visible in a draft of the Hooven Owens Rentschler Company publication on heavy-duty engines (1919; Box Man-14, Folder 17). Product specifications, pricelists, and advertising provide useful information on production and marketing within the industry from 1923–1938 (Box 14, Folder 18). Excellent background information on the history of Butler County and Hamilton, Ohio, including the Great Flood of 1913 is found in the genealogical/historical group of documents at the end of Subseries I.C (Box Man-21, Folder 13).<lb/>
<lb/>
Material from the childhood and young adulthood of the Rentschler siblings consists of letters (from George to his mother), valentines (from George to his mother and Robert to his sister and brother George), essays, school reports, and yearbooks. Gordon's Hamilton High School reports and Princeton University reports (1898–1907) are found in Box Man-15, Folder 4. A train trip by Thomas A. Dorsey, Howard See, Frederick B. Rentschler, Robert P. Rentschler, and Gordon S. Rentschler to the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair provides an interesting travelogue (Box Man-15, Folder 11). The death of Robert P. Rentschler in 1915 at the age of thirty-one is recorded in a condolence letter from Louis D. Froelick, the Princeton Class Secretary, to Phoebe S. Rentschler, and in a bound resolution from his class (Box Man-15, Folder 17). The collection also contains letters from three female friends of Gordon Rentschler's: Dorothy McKinney, Antoinette C. Hearne, and Helen Marie Brant, written from 1910 to 1912 (Box Man-15, Folder 7). Brant's letters in particular contain a vivid description of a road trip across the Southwest of the United States.<lb/>
<lb/>
Later correspondence (circa 1918–1948) is an eclectic mix of letters recording the milestones in Rentschler's life and his personal and public service. These include: Sidney Waldon's praise for Rentschler's unsung war efforts in 1918 (Box 15, Folder 18); thankyou letters for gifts and employment assistance (Box 15, Folders 20 &amp; 22); a tribute from his Princeton University Class of 1907, honoring his appointment as National City Bank President (Box 16, Folder 2); correspondence from James M. Cox, Governor of Ohio and 1920 presidential running mate to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, awarding him a "Rentschler Badge" for his role in breaking up a gang of horse thieves in Butler County, Ohio (1931; Box 16, Folder 7). An annotated note attached to another medal reads "struck in memory of the wash-room episode Aug 26 1933 on L.I. when some 'hero' socked the 'Kingfish'—Huey Long—in much needed retribution." Huey Long was a controversial Senator from Louisiana. The badge and the event that the note refer to are unknown. However, this was the period of banking Senate Committee Hearings in Washington, D.C. (Medal removed to Box Mem-38).<lb/>
<lb/>
In 1947 he was presented with the Belgian Order of the Crown, and in 1949 he was appointed Honorary Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE), both awards honored his work during World War II, the latter was awarded for his efforts in the Lend Lease program. (The correspondence suggests that he was awarded the CBE in 1947, but the medal was received posthumously by Mary C. Rentschler in 1949. The correspondence can be found in Box 16, Folders 18 &amp; 20. The medals were removed to Boxes Mem-40 and Mem-41.) Similarly, he received certificates signed by New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia (1941) and United States President Harry Truman (1946). (Removed to oversize print material Box 3). All of these letters, certificates, and medals reflect a life of public service as the leader of one of America's largest banking institutions. This is firmly underscored by the large number of condolence letters received by his wife and National City Bank at the time of his death in 1948. Correspondents include: Ralph S. Danon, Abraham Flexner, B. C. Forbes, James Forrestal, Bernard F. Gimbel, John D. Rockefeller, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., Robert M. Sohngen, and Cardinal Spellman. Gordon Rentschler's death papers also include beautiful, illuminated testimonials from companies and institutions associated with him, as well as correspondence surrounding the creation of a Gordon S. Rentschler memorial professorship at Princeton University. (The death papers are in Boxes Man-18 &amp; Man-19.)<lb/>
<lb/>
The documents demonstrate Rentschler's stature in the business world. However, this knowledge is balanced with a few other, more private artifacts in the collection. Rentschler's bible contains selected correspondence, such as the following letter from Mary C. Rentschler at the time of her first husband's death:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"If it were not for friends like you, I do not know how I could go on. But I draw strength from the love I know you bore Ted—&amp; that I feel you will always bear him—for that is the kind of friend you are, as he often told me. Ted's friendship with you was one of his most cherished possessions. I hope I may be allowed to keep it and guard it always. Most devotedly yours, Mary C. Atkins" (1923 January 30; The bible and letters are housed together in Box Mem-30).</p></blockquote></p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref58_bww" level="file"><did><unittitle>Financial: Minutes</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1925 January 20-1944 September 21</unitdate><container id="aspace_2c41b398855927dd2f6086e7fdf12632" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">Man-14</container><container parent="aspace_2c41b398855927dd2f6086e7fdf12632" type="Folder">13</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_ee7c5625e12df16e2e45443cad2ebc4a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Minutes of the George Adam Rentschler Company, Hamilton, Ohio.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_b7556ca87c4d3b75dd70c739b73e3fe6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Incorporation papers</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1904 October 11-1935 January 7</unitdate><container id="aspace_d58a86077ef96cac9c9120e2302f4b1b" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">Ovz-3</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6e5f3c92c16d469b73360e594cf4dab9"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>G.

Helen Rentschler Waldon (1890–1967) [HRW]</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_08cbc8d902664eaf8dc03301a12a36d6"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Helen Rentschler Waldon was born in 1890, the only daughter of Phoebe Schwab Rentschler and George Adam Rentschler Sr. The bulk of the correspondence in this group was written to her by her family and reflects her primary role as a dutiful daughter and loyal sibling and wife. On September 29, 1906, Phoebe wrote to Helen at the Ogontz School in Pennsylvania: "Well my dear daughter be a good child as you always have been let no one lead you astray, but be the same true simple little girl you always have been" (Box Man-22, Folder 2). Helen's formal education, away from home, indicates an egalitarian attitude toward a female child, albeit couched in traditional patronizing language. Three years later her mother counsels thriftiness in economic hard times, and we indirectly learn that her father, George Adam Rentschler Sr., enjoyed privileged information as a bank official:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"You know Papa is always much concerned about his people especially the little shop &amp; he takes it upon himself to help them keep the wolf from their doors. No doubt there will be much suffering among the working classes. In fact money is so scarce that it is wise for all classes to be watchful &amp; saving. Things are more serious than the newspapers tell, but it is wise for the papers to make light of it, for it would scare those who have their savings in the banks &amp; cause much trouble. The banks of Hamilton are solid &amp; people have no need to fear, but then it is hard to make them understand &amp; believe when they have their all placed in safe keeping. Papa is in a position to know the circumstances, as he is a director in two Hamilton banks &amp; on the inside workings of the other three. . . . So my dear child do your share of economical financing too" (circa 1908/9; Box Man-22, Folder 2).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
Helen's own letters to Gordon and Mary (in other parts of the collection) are often sentimental, and although there is a dearth of information, one senses that duty to her family superseded personal aspirations for many years; especially perhaps as she was the first female of the house after her mother died in 1916. There is a paucity of correspondence from non-family members. Extant letters include correspondence from Ohio friends Don and Cyrus Fitton and Brant Elliott, stationed in Europe during World War I (Box Man-22, Folder 3); as well as colorful letters written by Lee Olwell traveling in Singapore and China in 1926 (Box Man-22, Folder 8).<lb/>
<lb/>
In August 1922 her father wrote to her in Biddeford, Maine:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"Everything is going along nicely. I am feeling about the same as I did when you left. The house is very lonesome without you. Gordon hasn't come back yet, and Bud is away most of the time. I hope you will enjoy every minute of your stay there, in as short a time as you can. You can't come home any too son. With my sincere love to you" (Box Man-22, Folder 5).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
Her absence is keenly felt and the letter contains a barely disguised command to return home. Again, it suggests that Helen's first obligation is to her father and her home. Helen had a particularly strong relationship with her brother Gordon. In 1927, a month before his wedding to Mary, Gordon wrote the following:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"Nothing can ever take you away from me. Mama gave you to me when we started off to country school one bright May day away back in 1896 when you were a wee small girl. And ever since and always you will be my own dearest Diddy, baby sister, dearest daughter &amp; great life inspiration. God has given three great women to my life. Our dear little Mama, my own darling Diddy and my Mary. . . . You know how proud I am of you and how I adore you. . . ." (Box Man-22, Folder 9).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
It is as a mirror to others that her material is so valuable. Subseries I.D contains the only notable letters from her eldest brother, Robert P. Rentschler. In 1906 Robert wrote to his sister about a parade at Princeton University attended by United States President Theodore Roosevelt and University President Woodrow Wilson, the future President of the United States. He jokes at the "comic" seriousness of the parade (Box Man-22, Folder 2). Similarly, in the summer of 1927, Gordon wrote a letter to his sister referring to their brother Bud's (George Adam Rentschler Jr.) marriage to a stage performer. [George Adam Rentschler Jr. divorced his first wife, Joan Baker, in 1936, and subsequently married Rita Rend Mitchell, the daughter of National City Bank Chairman Charles Mitchell.] This letter is unusual as it articulates Gordon's sadness and intimate feelings—a rare occurrence within this body of materials (other than love for Mary). In addition, we indirectly learn of Gordon's sense of responsibility toward his siblings and witness a measure of self-reflection (B Box Man-22, Folder 9). The insight that this letter affords is repeated on a happier occasion aboard an ocean liner traveling from New York to Europe:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"We duly celebrated the advance beyond the dear old Goddess of Liberty by holding quite a ceremony over Marion's caviar and the things that she told me that really belonged with good caviar, and inasmuch as this was good caviar, and had a long hard trip all the way from Russia in order to attend our party, we saw to it that its good friends, Gordon Gin and Bacardy attended the party. I think Marion is really responsible for giving this whole party a good start, because it was the excuse to get the crowd down in my room and get on a basis in ten minutes, which ordinarily requires the most serious part of ten days. . . . the friends are the kind I usually find, the ones who look slick and come by it naturally" (On board the SS Majestic, 1926 September 1; Box Man-22, Folder 8).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
The polite and conventional voice that resonates in Helen's letters remains largely intact after she marries and continues with her own life. However, the treatment her brother received during the banking scandals of the 1930s enraged her:<lb/>
<lb/>
<blockquote><p>"It is all so unfair, and of course what sticks out foremost in my mind is that awful statement made by that dreadful person called Senator Cousins, and made to me by him in my house. I wish I could testify to that extent. I have Mary Crews to bear witness to his statement about what he proposed to do to make votes for 'we senators.' Cousins is about as popular as a rattlesnake in Detroit right now, since he has to xxx record, the fact that he was the sole member of the committee who refused to sanction the R.F.C. [Reconstruction Finance Committee] loan to save our banking situation. May justice be dealt him some day!" (1933 February 27; Box Man-10, Folder 8—Mary C. Rentschler materials).</p></blockquote><lb/>
<lb/>
In 1928, at the age of thirty-eight, Helen married Sidney Dunn Waldon, an expert in the aeronautical and automotive industries. [This was Sidney D. Waldon's second marriage. His first marriage was to Lois Burton of Erie, Pennsylvania. They had a daughter, Maunee (Mrs. Maunee Streit).] Born in Great Britain in 1873, Sidney D. Waldon emigrated to America in 1893. He subsequently had a long engineering career. Helen R. Waldon's papers include photocopies of letters from several of the companies that Waldon worked for, including photocopies of letters from J. M. Packard of the Packard Motor Car Company, 1900–1919 (Box Man-22, Folder 1). He joined the company in 1902 and became a vice president at Packard in 1910. In 1933 Henry B. Joy, a Packard Car Company executive, wrote the following to Sidney: "A certain manufacturing outfit would not be on the map today if it were not for you good self, chiefly, and the other good soldiers who enabled me to win the undying fame (now forgotten) of having put Packard out in front" (1933 November 24; Box Man-22, Folder 12). After the Packard Motor Car Company moved to Detroit, Michigan, from Warren, Ohio, circa 1903, Waldon became interested in the street railway system of that city and fought vigorously, but unsuccessfully, to have a subway system built.<lb/>
<lb/>
In 1915 Waldon resigned from Packard to become an executive and an engineer with the Cadillac Motor Company, where he remained for a year. In 1916 he left Cadillac to aid the Government, and during 1917 and 1918 he was one of the principal engineering aides in the nascent United States air force. He helped design the Liberty Engine in Washington, D.C. in 1916. Through his enthusiasm for aviation he became a friend of Orville Wright. [News clippings of a committee to create landing strips and airports, headed by Orville Wright in 1919, are in Box Man-24, Folder 3. Orville Wright was also a friend of Gordon S. Rentschler and Colonel E. A. Deeds. They all drove across the United States in 1919.] Helen Waldon's letters include a personal one from Katherine Wright, Orville's sister, who describes a comical boating mishap on vacation in Ontario, Canada, in August 1922 (Box Man-22, Folder 5). Throughout his life, Sidney D. Waldon was an avid "amateur" photographer. Beautiful panoramic photographs from a 1919 Packard road trip out west can be found in Box Man-5-through-9 (albums/framed photograph boxes); and extraordinary photographs from a road trip across Africa, 1924–1925, are located in Box Man-10 of the same group. Diaries from the African trip were removed to Box Mem-55 and Box Mem-56, and related correspondence is found in Box Man-22, Folder 7, of the manuscript collection.<lb/>
<lb/>
Sidney D. Waldon and Helen R. Waldon built a home they named Pine Knob in Clarkston, Michigan, in 1928, the year they were married. [A diary written by Sidney D. Waldon describing the construction of Pine Knob in 1928 can be found in Box Man-22, Folder 10. Dedication booklets for the home are in Box Man-22, Folder 21.] The main building of this 820-acre estate was in the style of an English manor. Pine Knob was the focal point of many social gatherings of their group of friends called the "Wing Lakers," as well as a summer destination for their nieces—Phoebe, Mary (Mimi), and Susan Rentschler. The Waldons lived here until 1941, when they moved to Hamilton, Ohio. In Ohio Sidney worked as a treasurer and director for the General Machinery Corporation (a Rentschler concern) until he died in 1945. Four years later, Helen sold Pine Knob to the Henry Ford Hospital [see Box Man-23, Folder 7, for the real estate brochure advertising Pine Knob] and moved into the Hamilton, Ohio farm that she leased from her sister-in-law, Mary C. Rentschler [see Box Man-22, Folder 17, for the lease]. The farm reverted back to Mary C. Rentschler in 1967, when Helen died. [An inventory of furnishings and art at Pine Knob and the Hamilton Farm can be found in Box Man-23, Folders 5 &amp; 6, and Parke-Bernet, New York auction catalogs list items sent to auction.]</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_fac0e8c362ed41df22bf7970a9e5b1b7" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence, postcard</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1900 July 3-1927 April 5</unitdate><container id="aspace_08c78bb011f0a0a7aeafb1d6794b3b81" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">Man-22</container><container parent="aspace_08c78bb011f0a0a7aeafb1d6794b3b81" type="Folder">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_6867574320998c0a5e05515016d14775"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Photocopies of correspondence and documents re: Sidney D.
