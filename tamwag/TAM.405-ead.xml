            <p>Daniel Harris (born Daniel Horwitz), 1903-1987, came to the United States illegally through Cuba after a series of stratagems to escape Russian Lithuania in 1923. He worked as a CPUSA organizer briefly in Harlem while he lived in a Lower East Side rooming house and looked for construction work. At some point he apprenticed as a pipefitter, despite an unofficial anti-ethnic bar. He was one of the few "proletarian worker-writers" in the CP's John Reed Club. With the help of Party regulars, he soon published a novella, "Going East," in the Daily Worker Sunday Supplement (August 22-September 14, 1934). He was acquainted with Mike Gold and (then leftist) Philip Rahv. Always a Trotskyist, he shaken by the Moscow Trials and the death of Leon Trotsky. He broke with the Stalinists after he became critical of Party orthodoxy. From the mid-1940s onward, he was active in the Brotherhood of Plumbers and Pipefitters, Local Union No. 2, AFL-CIO. At some point in the war years, rewarded after a stateside army stint and having changed his name to Harris, he became a naturalized citizen.</p>
