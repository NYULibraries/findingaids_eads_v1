In the fall of 1917, Claessens was elected to the New York State Assembly, as a representative of one of Manhattan's Lower East Side assembly districts, and was one of five socialist assemblymen who the Assembly refused to seat after their 1919 reelections. In 1922, Claessens was allowed to take office after being re-elected for the third time. In the mid-1930s Claessens withdrew from the Socialist Party and became the executive secretary and, later, the national chairman of the Social Democratic Federation. Claessens held the position of national chairman until his death in 1954, and also ran unsuccessfully for a number of local and state offices. Claessens taught a variety of subjects at the Rand School of Social Science from the mid-1920s until his death in 1954, including public speaking, psychology, race relations, labor-management relations, socialist theory, politics, anthropology, and sex and society. Claessens also served as an instructor in several evening schools sponsored by various New York City labor unions.

            <p>August Claessens (1885-1954) was one of the most influential leaders in the educational and political development of the Socialist Party. Shortly after becoming a socialist in 1909, Claessens helped organize support for the Socialist Party within several New York City labor unions. In the fall of 1917, Claessens was elected to the New York State Assembly. As a representative of one of the Lower Manhattan assembly districts, Claessens drafted and worked for legislation pertaining to child labor, the penal code's procedures for obtaining an admission of quilt, the abolishment of the Volstead Act, the abolishment of the death penalty, and the regulation of police powers in suppressing strikes.</p>
            <p>On April 1, 1920, Claessens was one of five socialist assemblymen who were expelled from the State Assembly on the grounds that membership in the Socialist Party constituted disloyalty to the United States. Although legally represented in the fight to retain his office by Charles Evans Hughes, a future United States Supreme Court Chief Justice, Claessens was denied his seat throughout the turbulent period of the Red Scare. In September 1920, Claessens was re-elected to the State Assembly in a special election, but again the anti-socialist forces, led by Assembly Speaker Thaddeus C. Sweet, refused to permit Claessens to take office. Finally, in 1922, Claessens was allowed to take office after being re-elected to the State Assembly for the third time.</p>
            <p>In the mid-1930s Claessens withdrew from the Socialist Party and became the executive secretary and, later, the national chairman of the Social Democratic Federation. Claessens held the position of national chairman until his death in 1954. Besides his involvement with the Social Democratic Federation, Claessens also ran unsuccessfully for a number of local and state offices.</p>
            <p>Claessens was one of the most active faculty members at the Rand School of Social Science. From the mid-1920s until his death in 1954, Claessens taught courses in such subject areas as public speaking, parliamentary procedure, psychology and social psychology, race relations, labor-management relations, socialist theory, contemporary politics, anthropology, and sex and society. Claessens also served as an instructor in several evening schools sponsored by various New York City labor unions. At these schools, Claessens primarily taught courses in public speaking and labor-management relations.</p>

            <p>The collection documents August Claessens's involvement with the Socialist Party and his work as a lecturer and New York State assemblyman, primarily from the 1920s to the 1940s. The majority of the collection consists of manuscripts and notes of Claessens's lectures, pamphlets, books, addresses, and statements, with emphasis on themes of labor, socialism, and socialist humor. Other genres of materials include correspondence, photographs, and biographical materials.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                    <p>Series III contains 26 photographs (XIV:D) that are arranged in chronological order and include portraits of August Claessens, group photographs, photographs of Claessens with other socialist figures, and photographs of Claessens teaching at the Rand School. Each photograph has been labeled with a number in the lower right-hand corner of the picture. These numbers correspond with the description of the photographs in the complete reel list. There are also approximately 20 photographs of Claessens and his family and friends which have not been microfilmed.</p>
                    <p>The printed matter in this collection (XIV:E) is organized into the following seven subject files: (1) Claessens legislative bills, New York State Assembly; (2) election campaigns; (3) lecture announcements; (4) miscellaneous; (5) pamphlets; (6) socialist legislative bills, New York State Assembly; and (7) testimonials. Each subject file has been assigned a frame number, including each item in the pamphlets file.</p>
                    <p>The legislative bills constitute the largest bulk of materials in the printed matter series. These bills are divided into two files: (1) 16 bills drafted by Claessens from 1918 to 1919 (XIV:E:1); and (2) 74 bills drafted by the five socialist assemblymen during the period, January-April 1918 (XIV:E:6). The bills drafted by the five socialist assemblymen include legislation on the regulation of municipal street railway fares, municipal ownership of public utilities, repeal of the state police department, abolishment of the death penalty, regulation of child labor, reorganization of the City College of New York, expansion of workmen's compensation, free university education, and the establishment of municipal day nurseries.</p>
                    <p>This series also includes five pamphlets which were written by Claessens (XIV:E:5). A bibliographical citation for each pamphlet in this file can be found in the complete reel list.</p>
