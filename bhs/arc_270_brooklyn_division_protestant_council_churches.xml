    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Records of the Brooklyn Division of the Protestant Council of Churches offer the history of a century of Protestant organizations originating from the Brooklyn City Tract Society, which was founded as a branch of the American Tract Society in 1829 to "promote the interests of evangelical religion, by the systematic distribution within the bounds of [Brooklyn], of religious Tracts published by the American Tract Society: and to aid that Society, with all surplus funds, in extending its operations."   Originally focusing on the dissemination of religious literature and scripture, the Society soon expanded to offer religious services, and employed missionaries to extend their work throughout the City of Brooklyn.  The Society's name was changed in 1858 to The Brooklyn City Mission and Tract Society, and in the same year its constitution was amended to reflect this change.</p><p>The Society continued to prosper under its new name, employing both men and women as missionaries, and made active efforts to reach out to the underprivileged, including mothers and children, especially recent immigrants.  Much of the Society's work focused upon the idea of "American Christianity" with the hope of turning its wards into devout Christians and "reliable and helpful citizens."   Each missionary was charged with the task of visiting every tenement in his or her district, distributing literature, and, if welcomed, establishing neighborhood prayer meetings.</p><p>In 1886, the Woman's Branch of the Brooklyn City Mission and Tract Society was formally organized.  Known as the Women's Auxiliary from 1887 on, this division coexisted alongside the Society and "was to supplement the work of The City Mission, by taking up mission work to be done in homes among women and children."   All Christian women were encouraged to join the Auxiliary, not necessarily to work as missionaries, but to lend their prayers, influence, and financial support to the cause of missionary work.</p><p>The Society sponsored many activities aimed at drawing persons away from vices such as alcohol and gambling.  Activities sponsored by the Society included lectures, prayer meetings, bible classes, and a sewing school.  The Society founded a "Floating Bethel" in 1893.  This boat/meeting house was removed from the brothels and taverns of the waterfront and provided a space where sailors could come to read, write, rest, and pray.</p><p>In addition, the Society worked to "rescue the perishing," primarily through its City Mission Night Shelter for Homeless Men, which provided food, shelter, aid in obtaining employment, and religious services.   The Society itself offered employment to many, running a broom factory and chair caning facility.  These successful business ventures helped defray the costs of the Society's charitable work.</p><p>As the Society continued to expand, it focused less on the dissemination of literature.  Missionary work had become the Society's primary function, and by 1906 it operated 16 mission stations in Brooklyn.  The Society chose to change its name accordingly in 1929 to the Brooklyn City Mission Society.  The bylaws were also amended, declaring the Society's objective as being "to promote interdenominational missionary interests in the Borough of Brooklyn and to minister to the spiritual and material needs of the unfortunate."
   
Shortly after this change in 1932, the Brooklyn City Mission Society took on the work of the Brooklyn Federation of Churches.  The Federation had been established in 1920 to bring all Protestant denominations and races together in a cooperative effort to promote Christianity through religious education, social service, court work, and other venues.  The two organizations had operated side by side for many years, sharing a Secretary, Dr. Frederick M. Gordon, from 1926 to 1932.  The Society again changed its name, this time to the Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation.  The bylaws of the Brooklyn City Mission Society were amended in accordance with the restructuring to declare a twofold object: 1) "to unite the Protestant Churches of Christ in Brooklyn for the prosecution of work that can better be done in union than in separation, and to secure a larger combined influence for the churches in all matters affecting the religious, moral and social welfare of the people, so as to promote the application of the law of Christ in every relation of human life," and 2) "to promote interdenominational missionary interests in the borough of Brooklyn, and to minister to the spiritual and material needs of the unfortunate."</p><p>The Federation continued to operate as such over the next decade, working throughout Brooklyn to reach out to a large, diverse, and changing community.  With the Great Depression, the church had to rethink its mission, focusing more on service to the community and providing aid to those in need. Outreach during this time included mothers' clubs, boys' clubs, parole and court work, civic affairs conferences, industrial relations conferences, and population surveys.  The Federation also began to focus on church unity, as it observed that cooperative efforts would "produce greater strength and a more definite program and positive results."</p><p>In June of 1946, the Federation "voted to amalgamate its program and activities with The Protestant Council of the City of New York to become the Brooklyn Division of the Council."   Although the Brooklyn Church and Mission Federation was not officially dissolved, the organization was now widely known as the Brooklyn Division of the Protestant Council of Churches.  As such, the organization further shifted its focus to church unity and the future survival of the Protestant Church.</p><p>With the demographic changes of the early and mid-20th century, the face of Brooklyn Protestantism had changed greatly.  At the turn of the century, Protestants made up more than one-half of Brooklyn's population.  By 1950, Protestant Brooklynites had dropped to 19.5 percent of the total population.   The increase in immigration of non-Protestant groups and the movement of the population to the suburbs led to a major decrease in the population of the Division's traditional Brooklyn base of white Protestants.  By the later half of the 20th century, Protestants had become a religious minority within both the Borough of Brooklyn and the City of New York, causing the church to reevaluate its position within the community.  The Division expanded its field of social services to include work with veterans, hospital and jail chaplaincies, interracial projects, peace activities, and economic justice programs.  As the Division moved its focus towards social service and away from direct mission work, it strove to identify the church as an indispensable part of the community.  It strove to promote unification especially with the growing African American Protestant community that made up nearly one-half of Brooklyn's Protestant population by 1963.   The Division continued for the remainder of the 20th century to use its influence as a united body within the community to strive for social reform to assist Brooklyn's ever changing population.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">

This series provides significant documentation of 19th-century Protestantism and missionary work. The journals of the Brooklyn City Mission and Tract Society detail the missionary work of the Society. Originally published as the Society's annual report, the journal came to be published monthly and contained poetry, fictional stories, photographs, and reports on the Society's missionary work. Each issue focused on the report of one major missionary project, whether the Floating Bethel, the City Mission Night Shelter for the Homeless, or one of the Society's missions. Included are statistics on how many had taken advantage of a given facility, the services provided there, financial breakdowns, staffing information, and the goals of the facility. Also included in the journals are lists of officers, missionaries, and the members of the Women's Auxiliary, testimonials, and brief updates on other work in the community.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref14_xmn" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 5: Subject files</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="6461" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">6461</unitid><unitdate normal="1950/1974" type="inclusive">1950-1974</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_566000491c8d3254ca12374b0e080406" label="Mixed Materials [34444506250927]" type="Box">ARC.270 9 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_a5613432477ab4dd77af7637e01afa0d" label="Mixed Materials [34444506250935]" type="Box">ARC.270 10 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_07d067bcfb1e72cead13f94457674759" label="Mixed Materials [34444506250943]" type="Box">ARC.270 11 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_79d629b4f03f302aecc4b8b998c949fe" label="Mixed Materials [34444506250950]" type="Box">ARC.270 12 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_0444a45db6a78f69be043d95c6fd28ec" label="Mixed Materials [34444506250968]" type="Box">ARC.270 13 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_6e88f04da5363c94320b42c6dfaa8071" label="Mixed Materials [34444506250976]" type="Box">ARC.270 14 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_9608e9c067ecff6078670ceb79b11c3e" label="Mixed Materials [34444506250984]" type="Box">ARC.270 15 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_49543870b4c7b6e53b9d7cac35ffc4f8" label="Mixed Materials [34444506250992]" type="Box">ARC.270 16 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_c53bde191d9b5a58c48d62f0716f4fea" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251008]" type="Box">ARC.270 17 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_e7a071c29737abc7cdf26e9ab1f28bfb" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251016]" type="Box">ARC.270 18 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_cd7a77b89a8eb9cd0eddd27583386d98" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251024]" type="Box">ARC.270 19 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_79e734534f20f5b3ca86b5445a5df7d2" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251032]" type="Box">ARC.270 20 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_51badd17b38b0690a569002bef972be4" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251040]" type="Box">ARC.270 21 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_0eecc3eda61ea098abe9a26ae748f86b" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251057]" type="Box">ARC.270 22 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_91eb9a514f28ccc30e7c83accc5b9600" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251065]" type="Box">ARC.270 23 of 36</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_22f849d3ae0a10306212170efe97604a"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>The subject files make up a significant portion of the collection. Dating from 1950 to 1974, the files cover topics the Brooklyn Division was concerned with during this period, as well as files concerning the day to day running of the Division. Files include information on different parishes, the clergy volunteer program, the education committee, the 1973 United Farm Workers' Strike, and neighborhood revitalization. Many of these files contain detailed statistical analysis of the demographics of Brooklyn, gathered by the Division to determine how Protestant churches might best serve and appeal to the community. Included in the files are newspaper clippings, correspondence, pamphlets, and committee minutes. Some of the material in these files is restricted due to issues of privacy.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref18_t6m" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series 6: Scrapbooks</unittitle><unitid audience="internal" identifier="6463" type="Archivists Toolkit Database::RESOURCE_COMPONENT">6463</unitid><unitdate>1847-1864, 1934-1964</unitdate><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_329410d791d9d7fb207d2b647973d9cd" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251065]" type="Box">ARC.270 23 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_254ffde8e09e7710225e32cd669edf37" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251073]" type="Box">ARC.270 24 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_a845441311b03ee50bd1ddd1f40efcc6" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251081]" type="Box">ARC.270 25 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_7ebea413e98c938176eed642f01175c9" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251099]" type="Box">ARC.270 26 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_7099b772e570d8894816002edeee3090" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251107]" type="Box">ARC.270 27 of 36</container><container altrender="Full Manuscript Box Legal" id="aspace_2b184822895be810322d18f4a024aa8b" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251115]" type="Box">ARC.270 28 of 36</container><container altrender="Medium Flat Box 3" id="aspace_84996429c3559f0a6f701a22a84e9b99" label="Mixed Materials [34444506251263]" type="Box">ARC.270 36 of 36</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8a79b62b685ce9b195303e49da28d0fa"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>These scrapbooks contain newspaper clippings and photographs regarding the Brooklyn Division's activities and
