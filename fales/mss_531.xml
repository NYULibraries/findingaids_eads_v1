    <abstract id="aspace_81ea9bcdf4bde0944e02dcc37897888f">Kenneth Neill Cameron was a literary scholar and professor who specialized in English Romantic poetry and, especially, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and his contemporaries. He was the editor of "Shelley and His Circle" volumes one through four, a celebrated chronological retrospective and catalogue of Percy Bysshe Shelley's (and his contemporaries') works. Kenneth Neill Cameron continued to write about Shelley and his circle of contemporaries throughout his life, but also developed an interest in and wrote about Marxist philosophy, history, and politics (which was partly inspired by Shelley-and-Circle's rebelliousness). The materials in this collection include Cameron's early academic works, correspondence, and a manuscript of a play.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Kenneth Neill Cameron was a literary scholar and professor who specialized in English Romantic poetry and, especially, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and his contemporaries. </p><p>Cameron was born in England but spent most of his life in North America, moving to Canda in 1914 and receiving a degree from McGill University in 1931 in Montreal, Canada. He also attended Pembroke College at Oxford University (Oxford, England) as a Rhodes Scholar, where he received a BA and Bachelor of Letters degree, and developed an interest in percy Bysshe Shelley. </p><p>After receiving a PhD from the University of Wisconsin in 1939, Kenneth Neill Cameron served as an English Professor at the University of Indiana until 1952. </p><p>From 1952 to 1966/67, Cameron supervised acquisitions, and performed arrangement and editorial work at Carl H. Pforzheimer Library, a private repository of late-18th and early-19th century English literature. Here, Cameron was the editor of "Shelley and His Circle" volumes one through four, a celebrated chronological retrospective and catalogue of Percy Bysshe Shelley's (and his contemporaries') works.</p><p>Kenneth Neill Cameron's other most notable works include "The Young Shelley: Genesis of a Radical," a biography of Percy Bysshe Shelley published in 1950, and 1973's "Romantic Rebels: Essays on Shelley and His Circle." Inspired by Shelley's (and the Circle's) rebellious nature and interests, Cameron became interested in Marxist philosophies, and is also known for writing "Marx and Engels Today: A Modern Dialogue on Philosophy and History" in 1976, as well as "Marxism: The Science of Society; An Introduction" in 1985.</p><p>In later life, Cameron received the Keats-Shelley Association's very first Distinguished Scholar Award (1982). </p><p>Kenneth Neil Cameron was married in 1945 to Mary Owen, with whom he had one daughter, and died of pneumonia in New York City on March 14, 1994.</p>  </bioghist>
