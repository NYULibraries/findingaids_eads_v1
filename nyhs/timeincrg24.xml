    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p><title render="italic">Time</title> is the first magazine created by Time Inc. with the first issue published on March 3, 1923. </p><p>For the majority of Time Inc.'s existence, the company maintained a strict separation of editorial from the publishing and business side of each magazine, colloquially called the separation of "church" (editorial) and "state" (publishing). Publishing and Business Management includes the publisher, general manager, business manager, advertising sales, marketing services, letters, circulation, and public relations. Cofounder Henry Luce structured Time Inc. this way so that the business side could not (in theory) influence the editorial content of the publications. For example, the advertising sales people could not interfere with a magazine's decision to run an article on the dangers of cigarette smoking, even though it might mean losing millions of dollars in tobacco ads.</p><p>According to the Ownership Statements in the General Administrative Files, the earliest publisher of <title render="italic">Time</title> was Time Inc., not an individual.</p><p>Citations:</p><p>Hooper, Bill.

It handled several events that promoted Time Inc. as a company as well as a magazine, such as: coordinating travel and accommodations for Time Inc. staff and corporate guests when Time Inc. was a sponsor of the Olympics; organizing major annual conferences and symposiums like the Housing Industry Presidents' Conference; and overseeing projects and initiatives such as the Distinguished Speakers Program and the Time-Life Academy of Transition.</p><p>Up until 1967, there is no mention in the corporate structure of <title render="italic">Time</title> magazine of a public affairs department. <title render="italic">Time</title> did have a marketing department and an advertising promotion department since the earliest saved Department Heads List in the Time Inc. Reference Files.</p><p>While Robert Sweeney is listed in the 1966 Department Heads List as an assistant to the <title render="italic">Time</title> publisher, he signs off as a member of <title render="italic">Time</title> Public Affairs in his 1966 files. It is possible public affairs was within the Publisher's Office even earlier, but not recorded as part of the structure.</p><p>Beginning in 1967, Sweeney is officially listed as the <title render="italic">Time</title> public affairs director under Management along side of the publisher, general manager, and business manager. He continues to appear with this title through 1969. In 1969 the Advertising Promotion Department drops the word "Advertising" and becomes the Promotion Department. </p><p>In 1970, Sweeney moves over to the newly established Corporate Public Affairs, and no one is listed as part of <title render="italic">Time</title> Public Affairs. No magazine lists its own public affairs department, and it is possible public affairs services were centralized.</p><p>In 1972 public affairs reappears as Promotion/Public Affairs headed by director C. Lane Fortinberry who is also an assistant publisher, and Robert Ankerson as the director of public affairs. Former promotion staff are also part of this department. </p><p>By 1974, the department is called General Promotion, still headed by assistant publisher Fortinberry and listing some of the same staff. The department now oversees special events and an art director. By 1978 Sweeney takes over as the director of General Promotion and holds this title until 1982. Also by 1978 General Promotion has added a publicity director.</p><p>By August 1983 General Promotion and Public Affairs have split into separate offices. George Berger takes over as the director of General Promotion, and Sweeney is listed as the director of Public Affairs overseeing the public affairs manager, the publicity manager, and the special events manager. GP oversees the promotion manager, creative director, and art director.</p><p>By 1985 Berger is replaced by Katherine Erskine and the position of creative director disappears.</p><p>By the end of 1987, Promotion and Public Affairs are again one office with Daniel Brewster as Promotion &amp; Public Affairs Director. The office oversees the business planning manager, art director, public affairs manager, promotion manager, and special events manager.</p><p>Citation:</p><p>Time Inc.

The newstours were arranged by Time Inc., funded by the participants, and encouraged by the U.S. government, though they played no role in the tours. </p><p>Participants were invited because of their expressed interest in world affairs and because they were known to be citizens seeking opportunities to contribute to global stability and world peace. The primary purpose was inquiry rather than commercial or economic information. Participants were heads of their fields in industry, education, community affairs, and other professions; each paid their own expenses and relied on the <title render="italic">Time</title> publisher's office and public affairs department with assistance from local <title render="italic">Time</title> news bureaus to arrange the program and meetings with international leaders in politics and culture. Newstour participants notably met with: John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Nikolai Khrushchev, Ferdinand Marcos, and Eisaku Sato.</p><p><title render="italic">Time</title> also sponsored a 1973 visit for Japanese business executives to Detroit and a 1970 trip to Tehran for an economics conference. "Update on America" and "Report on America" were opportunities for foreign business executives to travel to the United States and meet with <title render="italic">Time</title> journalists, American business leaders, and government representatives. Newstours that traveled the United States were sometimes called "reverse newstours."</p><p>For a history and background of newstours, please refer to "Newstour 1990" files in Books and Binders.</p><p>More files from the 1995 newstours are in the Corporate Public Affairs record group.
