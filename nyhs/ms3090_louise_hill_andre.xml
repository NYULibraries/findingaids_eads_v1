    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Dr. Louise Biles Hill (1891*- 1959) was a writer, teacher, and historian. Born in Tennessee, Hill received bachelor's and master's degrees from Columbia University, and a Ph.D. in American History from Vanderbilt University.  She was the author of "Joseph E. Brown and the Confederacy," a biography of the Civil War Governor of Georgia, published in 1940. The book was awarded the Mrs. Simon Baruch Prize by the Daughters of the Confederacy.
Dr. Hill taught at Huntington College in Alabama; Colorado State Teachers College; and Bennett Junior College in New York. She retired in 1948 as head of the social science department of Bergen Junior College, which is now part of Fairleigh Dickinson University.</p><p>*(Hill's obituary in the Bergen Evening Record (NJ) and her gravestone in Tennessee indicate her birthdate was 1876).</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists mainly of the research notes, drafts, and chapter outlines of Louise Biles Hill's unpublished book about Major John André (1751-1780). André was an officer in the British Army and head of its Secret Service in America during the American Revolutionary War. He was hanged as a spy by the Continental Army for assisting Benedict Arnold's treason. </p><p>The collection includes both typed and handwritten notes, as well as correspondence related to researching and publishing the book on Major André. It also contains 3 works by Hill that are unrelated to Major Andre: articles about Aaron Burr and George J.F. Clark, and a fictional story set in Florida during the 18th century.</p><p>In addition, the collection contains correspondence, notes and drafts from an unpublished manuscript about André written by Carroll Carstairs (1888-1948). Carstairs was an American art dealer who served in the Grenadier Guards of the British Army during World War I. Carstairs memoir of the conflict, "A Generation Missing," was published in 1930. It seems Hill obtained these items sometime after Carstairs'death in 1948.</p>  </scopecontent>
