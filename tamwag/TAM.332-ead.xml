            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This collection is composed primarily of transcripts and testimonies from hearings and investigations concerning the alleged Communist Party membership or associations of eight faculty members of New York City public universities. Conducted by the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, or its representatives, the hearings were held during two time periods: 1941 and 1953-1955.</p>
            <p>Hearings held in 1941 involved four members of the faculty of the City College of New York: Saul Bernstein, Biology instructor; Arthur R. Braunlich, Jr., tutor of English; Seymour A. Copstein, also an English tutor; and Philip S. Foner, History instructor. Each had previously appeared before the Joint Legislative Committee on the State Education System (Rapp-Coudert Committee) and each was charged with Party membership, committing perjury before Rapp-Coudert and failure to fully cooperate with the investigations.</p>
            <p>The second group of transcripts and testimonies (1953-1955) involve four more faculty members: Charles W. Hughes, associate professor in the Department of Music at Hunter College; V. Jerauld McGill, associate professor in the Department of Psychology and Philosophy at Hunter; Louis Weisner, associate professor of Mathematics at Hunter; and Dudley David Straus, English instructor at Queens College. McGill had previously appeared before Rapp-Coudert and was charged with giving false testimony, witholding information from the Board's Special Committee and colluding with Charles Hughes and Louis Weisner to refuse to answer certain questions; i.e., to inform on others. Hughes and Weisner were accused similarly (with the exception of the Rapp-Coudert perjury charge). Dudley David Straus was also charged with Communist Party membership.</p>
            <p>In addition to the transcripts and testimonies, there are a number of related documents including a copy of the Board's policy statement, "The Loyalty Investigation of our Municipal Colleges"; court documents from several related cases involving city secondary school teachers; an analysis and appraisal of The Report of the Rapp-Coudert Committee by the New York City Chapter of the National Lawyers Guild; and a critique of the judicial conduct of Judge Harold R. Medina in the 1949 Smith Act trial of Eugene Dennis and others.</p>

                <chronitem>
                    <date>January 20, 1941</date>
                    <event>The Board of Higher Education adopted a resolution which provided in part as follows: "Now, Therefore, Be It Resolved, that this Board direct all members of the staffs and all other employees under their jurisdiction to promptly obey all subpoenas issued by the Joint Legislative Committee, and to give such testimony and such other information as may be required by the Committee or any subcommittee thereof, and to otherwise cooperate with said Committee to the best of their ability..."</event>

                    <event>A Special Committee of the Board of Higher Education was appointed on "Section 903 of the City Charter, the Feinberg Law and Related Matters." The purpose of the Special Committee was to undertake an investigative program designed to obtain all of the facts and available information relating to the membership and activities of any college staff members in or connected with subsersive organizations and particularly of the Communist Party, and to take or recommend such actions as the facts warrant.</event>

                    <event>The Board of Higher Education adopted a resolution authorizing the Board's Special Committee..., or a duly credited representative of the Special Committee, to call in for questioning such members of the staffs as the Special Committee or its representatives deemed necessary with respect to possible past or present membership or association with any organization that advocates or teaches the doctrine of the forceful overthrow of the Government of the United States or with respect to past or present participation in activities of any such organization by any staff members. And further, that failure to cooperate fully and to answer all proper questions would subject staff members to disciplinary action.</event>
