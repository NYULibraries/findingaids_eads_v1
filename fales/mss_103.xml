            <abstract id="ref3" label="Abstract">Harold Hart Crane was born in 1899 and became a significant voice within modernist American poetry of the first half of the twentieth century. Crane moved to New York City and mixed with other prominent writers of the time and was influenced by both contemporary currents in poetry, and his early affinity for nineteenth-century French poets. In 1930, Crane received some acclaim from the publication of "The Bridge," his book-length poem that depicts New York City and his outlook on America in general. In 1932, upon completing a Guggenheim fellowship in Mexico, he set off by ship back to New York, but committed suicide by jumping from the deck during his passage.</abstract>

            <p>Harold Hart Crane was born in 1899 in Garrettsville, Ohio and became a significant voice within modernist American poetry of the first half of the twentieth century. Though without a college education and dissuaded from a career in poetry, Crane moved to New York City to write, where he met other prominent writers of the time, such as E. E. Cummings, Jean Toomer and Katherine Anne Porter. He was influenced by both the contemporary currents in poetry, such as T.S. Elliot, and his early affinity for nineteenth-century French poets, like Rimbaud. Most of his published material was written between 1924 and 1926, due in some part to his bouts with drinking and problems that arose from being gay in a culture that rejected homosexuality. In 1930, Crane received acclaim and distinction from the publication of "The Bridge," his book-length poem that depicts New York City and his outlook on America in general. Crane had struggled to complete "The Bridge," and when he found himself particularly at a loss, he sought inspiration by traveling to an island near Cuba and Europe. Once awarded a Guggenheim fellowship in 1931, he temporarily settled in Mexico. In 1932, upon completing the fellowship, he set off to New York from Mexico; at the age of thirty-three, Crane committed suicide by jumping into the Gulf of Mexico from the deck of the S. S. Orizaba during his passage.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Papers consist of letters, postcards, photographs, drawings, tearsheets, and clippings about Crane. Most of the items are typed letters signed by Crane to Charlotte and/or Richard Rychtarik. (Richard Rychtarik was an American set and costume designer of major productions at the Metropolitan Opera and other companies.) There are two letters from Waldo Frank to Crane, a handful of letters from Grace Hart Crane, and correspondence with Philip Horton. Among the photos are images of Crane in Brooklyn with the Bridge in the background, images of his rooms, of his visit to Woodstock, NY, and signed portraits, including one signed portrait by Walker Evans.</p>
            <p>The collection had been kept in a very acidic scrapbook which was disbound when the Fales Library received the materials. Many of the letters had been stapled to the acidic backing. These have been removed. When the backings contained information about the letters, they were retained. The scrapbook had its own numbering system, which is preserved on the folders and, often written on the letters themselves.</p>
            <p>SERIES DESCRIPTION</p>
            <p>The Papers are in one series, which corresponds to the arrangement of the scrapbook in which they had been housed. It is roughly chronological, though there are some photos and materials not in that order and other materials that were not a part of the original scrapbook. These follow the scrapbook order. Printed materials and related correspondence are listed at the end of the collection.</p>
