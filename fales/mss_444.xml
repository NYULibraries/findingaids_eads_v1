    <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
<p>Felice Picano (1944-) is an American author, editor, playwright, and activist, was a key figure of the Greenwich Village literary community from the mid-1970s through the 1990s. Author of the novels <emph render="italic">Smart as the Devil</emph> (1975), <emph render="italic">The Mesmerist</emph> (1977), and <emph render="italic">The Lure</emph> (1979), Picano became a principal member of the short-lived and influential literary salon the Violet Quill. In 1977, Picano founded Sea Horse Press, the country's first expressly gay-oriented publishing house, producing works by Dennis Cooper, Doric Wilson, Martin Duberman and Robert Gluck, among others. In 1981, Picano became editor-in-chief of The Gay Presses of New York, and, in 1982, Books Editor of the <emph render="italic">New York Native</emph>. His 1985 memoir, <emph render="italic">Ambidextrous: The Secret Lives of Children</emph>, was banned in England for its rumored depiction of childhood sexuality. Picano is the recipient of several prizes, including the Ferro-Grumley Award, the Gay Times of England Award for best gay novel, and the Syndicated Fiction/PEN Award for best short story. He received the Lambda Literary Foundation's Pioneer Award in 2010, and the City of West Hollywood's Rainbow Award and Citation in 2013.</p>  </bioghist>
