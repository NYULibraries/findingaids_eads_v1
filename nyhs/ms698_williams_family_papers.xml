Mehuman's father, Samuel (1643-1675), was killed in the Indian raid known as the Bloody Brook Massacre (1675), and Mehuman was captured by Indians twice. Ebenezer was ordained as a missionary but had more success in military and business enterprises. He founded Hinsdale, New Hampshire, and build Fort Hinsdale. He served in the French and Indian Wars. His marriage to Abigail Williams, daughter of Rev. John Williams, formed the connection between the Hinsdales and the Williams family.</event>

          <event>Birth of Thomas Williams, son of Ephraim Williams, Sr. (1691-1754) and Elizabeth Jackson (d. 1718). Much of the correspondence and many of the other papers included in this collection involve <title render="bold">Dr. Thomas Williams</title> (1718-1775) and his immediate family. A physician, Dr. Williams also participated in several military campaigns. In addition, he served in a number of local government positions. George Sheldon, in his 1895 book <title render="italic">A History of Deerfield Massachusetts</title>, writes that Williams "came to Deerfield in 1789; became a prominent figure as a man of affairs, as well as in his profession; was surgeon in the abortive Canadian expedition 1746 and for the line of forts; he left Fort Mass. only two days before its capture in 1746; was surgeon in the regt. of his brother Ephraim, at the battle of Lake George, Sept. 8, 1755 and dressed the wounds of Baron Dieskau, the captured commander of the Fr. army; in the campaign of 1756 he was lieut.-col.; rep 2 yrs; selectman 2; town clerk 17; judge of probate and justice of the court of common pleas; and had an extensive professional practice." Dr. Williams married Anna Childs in 1740 and three children were born before her death in 1746. He then married <title render="bold">Esther Williams</title>, the daughter of his cousin, <title render="bold">Rev. William Williams</title> (1688-1760).

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The descendants of Robert Williams (1607-1693) and Elizabeth Stalham (1597-1674) were a prestigious group whose members were social, economic, political, military and intellectual leaders. A great number were physicians, clergymen, or lawyers and many held positions of civic responsibility. Several had distinguished military careers. The founding of Williamstown, Massachusetts, and establishment of Williams College are among their accomplishments. William Williams (1731-1811), great great grandson of Robert Williams, was among the signers of the Declaration of Independence. </p><p>Members of the Williams family were among the earliest settlers of Deerfield, Massachusetts. Much has been written about Deerfield's Indian raids - the Bloody Brook Massacre in 1675 and the Deerfield Massacre, 1704 -- including several narratives concerning the capture of Reverend John Williams and his immediate family. The Redeemed Captive Returning to Zion (1707) was written by Rev. Williams describing his experiences in captivity. The Unredeemed Captive: A Family Story from Early America, written by John Demos in 1994, tells the story of Eunice Williams, John Williams' daughter, who chose to remain with her Indian captors.</p><p>The bulk of this collection falls during the time of the wars between the British and the French. Much of the correspondence and many of the papers involve military activity, some during King George's War (1745-1748) but most during the French and Indian War (1754-1763), especially the campaigns at Lake George and Crown Point. </p><p>There are 143 letters within the collection, the majority either written or received by Dr. Thomas Williams (1718-1775). Other materials include military papers; wills and other estate papers; inventories; surveys; receipts, notes and bills; deeds and other legal documents; medical papers; poetry and miscellaneous personal items.</p><p>Condition of the various items is mixed. Some are sturdy and legible while others are very fragile, torn, missing pieces or difficult to read. The collection has been microfilmed.</p>  </scopecontent>

In many of the letters he is referred to as Col. Williams, as they were written during his service as a military surgeon. Box 1, Folders 1 through 3 contain letters written to Dr. Williams from a variety of family members, military associates, physicians and others. Box 1, Folder 4 contains a series of letters written to Dr. Williams and his wife, Esther, by her father Rev. William Williams (1688-1760) who was Thomas's father-in-law and his cousin. In Box 1, Folder 5 are letters written to Esther Williams. The first sixteen are from her husband, written mostly while he was serving in the military. Letters written to Col. Ephraim Williams are contained in Box 1, Folder 7. Dr. Thomas Williams' son, Solomon, is the recipient of letters in Box 1, Folder 8. The final folder in this series contains letters to and from other Williams family members and associates. It is difficult to ascertain the recipient of some of the items.</p><p>Among the many letters of interest in this series are those that provide first-hand accounts of military activity during the French and Indian War. Two items in Box 1, Folder 8, written in March of 1842 by Dr. Stephen W. Williams (grandson of Dr. Thomas Williams), contain copies of a number of letters that fall into this category. In one, Dr. Williams tells his wife about the September 8, 1755, ambush (Early Morning Scout) and the death of his brother Ephraim, as well as the continuing battle at Lake George and capture of the French Baron Dieskau. Given his responsibilities as surgeon, he is able to describe the wounds sustained by many individual soldiers. Most of the other letters written in 1755 and 1756 also contain accounts of military action. A letter in Box 1, Folder 6, written by William Williams to Col. Ephraim Williams on September 2 (six days before Ephraim's death), includes a discussion of Ephraim's will along with comments about the state of the ongoing war.</p><p>A letter in Box 1, Folder 8, written August 22, 1755, to Monsieur St. Luke Lacorn by John Hawks, asks for help in locating captives in Canada. Several of the items mention smallpox and smallpox inoculation (Box 1, Folder 3, January 1765, #95 and Box 1, Folder 5, December 1776, #104). There is a letter in Box 1, Folder 8 written on July 11, 1750 to "the Gentlemen assembled at Deerfield" regarding a complaint against Ebenezer Hinsdale who was accused of intemperance. </p><p>Other letters focus on family, financial and personal affairs, health and illness issues, and local news. Many are filled with religious reflections, particularly those sent by Rev. William Williams.</p><p>Within each folder, the letters are arranged chronologically. The condition of the items is mixed.

The Hinsdale and Williams families were joined through the marriage of Ebenezer to Abigail Williams, daughter of Rev. John Williams (1664-1729). Another family member whose estate is included in this series is Abigail Norton (1745-1806), daughter of John Hinsdale and a favorite niece of Abigail Williams Hinsdale.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref36_xp6" level="file"><did><unittitle>Will of Col.
