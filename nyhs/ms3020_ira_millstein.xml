    <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
<p>Ira M. Millstein was born in New York City on 8 November 1926. He earned his law degree in 1949 from Columbia Law School. By the 1970s, he was a partner at the law firm of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges. The firm, including Millstein, served as counsel on bankruptcy matters to New York City during its fiscal crisis of the mid-late 1970s. At the peak of the crisis, in October 1975, New York was approaching due payments but with insufficient funds to pay them. Millstein wrote the filing that was submitted to the state Supreme Court to start the default process. Though the filing was approved and signed by Judge Irving Seybold, it was returned to the lawyers as unneeded as last minute debt relief came from union pension funds. Millstein and his firm continued to provide counsel, including in connection with an investigation launched by the Securities and Exchange Commission in early 1976. This investigation focused on concerns with New York's bond offerings, specifically with regard to misrepresentations and inadequate risk disclosure. The SEC's critical report was released in 1977, shortly before the Democratic Party primary, which incumbent Mayor Abraham Beame lost.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The collection includes documents related primarily to certain legal aspects of New York City's near-default on its obligations in 1975 and to the subsequent investigation of the city by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The collection includes the petition of 17 October 1975 submitted by the city to the state Supreme Court, the resulting court order that positioned New York to declare it was defaulting that day (an action that was narrowly averted), and the text of Mayor Beame's prepared, but never used, announcement of the default. The collection includes legal analyses, memoranda and other documents from 1975-1976 related to the possibility and implications of a default by New York. The collection includes memoranda concerning some aspects of the SEC's investigation, such as jurisdictional matters. The collection also holds copies of proposed legislation from 1975 relating to the state's financial emergency act and of various published articles, primarily from law journals, concerning the crisis from a legal perspective.</p>  </scopecontent>
