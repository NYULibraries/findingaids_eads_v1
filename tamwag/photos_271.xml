    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>Camp Higley Hill, a left-wing summer camp for children in Wilmington, Vermont, owned and operated by Max and Grace Granich.  Max Granich joined the Communist Party sometime in the late 1920s; he also served as chauffeur and bodyguard for Earl Browder, the Communist Party's General Secretary, and as Managing Editor of China Today. Grace Granich was a key administrative figure in the national office of the Communist Party (CPUSA), USA from 1930 to 1945, serving as secretary to Browder and as a member of its Organization Department.  Following the postwar expulsion of Browder from the CPUSA, the Graniches distanced themselves from the Communist Party and in 1946 opened Camp Higley Hill, which they ran until 1964.</p><p>Peter Hall, a Camp Higley Hill alumnus, is a sociologist who has taught at the University of California at Santa Barbara, York University, the University of Missouri, and Colorado State University; he has also worked toward educational reform, with an emphasis on diversity, at the local, state, and national level.</p>  </bioghist>
