    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Otto Dreschmeyer Brooklyn slides date from 1965 to 1968 and contain 157 items. The collection is composed entirely of color slides taken by Dreschmeyer in Brooklyn, likely using a Hasselblad camera. Slides dated 1965 document the annual Brooklyn Memorial Day parade. Parade images center around Grand Army Plaza, showing the crowds near the Brooklyn Public Library main branch and Soldiers' and Sailors' Memorial Arch, along with parade marchers on Eastern Parkway. Several slides show the John F. Kennedy Memorial at Grand Army Plaza around the time of its unveiling. Slides of the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens are also included.</p><p>Later images in the collection feature docks and beach scenes from Sheepshead Bay and Coney Island in Brooklyn, and Rockaway Point in Queens. Coney Island scenes document the boardwalk and associated attractions such as the Cyclone, Wonder Wheel, and Parachute Jump. Views of Coney Island from the ocean, as well as night views and fireworks displays are also included. Lastly, the collection contains views of Lower Manhattan and New York Harbor from Brooklyn, including the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, South Ferry in Manhattan and the Staten Island Ferry.</p>  </scopecontent>

    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Otto Dreschmeyer (1896-1983) was a resident of the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens.</p><p>Otto C. Dreschmeyer (1896-1983) was a lifetime resident at 2014 Stanhope Street in the Ridgewood neighborhood of Queens (1)(2); Ridgewood was formerly part of Brooklyn until 1977. Otto C.Dreschmeyer was never married, and had a sister named Ella (1899-1980)whom also lived at the family's residence. Ella was briefly married to Arthur Piens, who died in 1942, thus her name was changed to Ella
Piens (3). Dreschmeyer's father's name was Otto as well, his mother was Theresa (nee Schrader), and they were both immigrants from Germany (4). There is very little known about Otto C. Dreschmeyer's life other than a tragic car accident that he caused in 1936, reported on in the
New York Times (5). There is also a draft card registration for Dreschmeyer from 1942 (6). Dreschmeyer took these photographs in his later years, and it is unknown as to why he photographed.</p>    <list numeration="arabic" type="ordered">
