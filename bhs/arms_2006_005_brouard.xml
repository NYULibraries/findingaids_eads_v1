    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Royal W. Brouard was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. about 1891.  At the age of 18, in November of 1909, he enlisted with the 12th Company of the New York Coast Artillery of the National Guard (13th Coast Defense Command).  On August 5, 1917, he was drafted into federal service. The 13th Coast Defense Command became the 59th Artillery, Coastal Artillery Corps, and Brouard served with Battery F of the 59th Artillery.  The <emph render="italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</emph> of October 20, 1918 notes that "The 59th, with its 1,100 members of the old 13th as its nucleus, is, of course, essentially a Brooklyn regiment, with a Brooklynite, Col. Sydney Grant, its commander."  The 59th Artillery was the first Brooklyn organization sent to the line of battle in France and participated in the St. Mihiel drive, the Verdun offensive, and the battles of Argonne Forest and Romagne.  Battery F in particular was recognized for its work at the Argonne.</p><p>The 59th Artillery returned home to New York on January 24, 1919, and Brouard returned unwounded on the battleship USS <emph render="italic">New Hampshire</emph>.  He remained a member of the National Guard, achieving the rank of 2nd  Lieutenant on December 24, 1920.  In April of 1921, he resigned and received an honorable discharge from the National Guard.</p>  </bioghist>
