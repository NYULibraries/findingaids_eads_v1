<p>VietnameseBoatPeople.org is comprised of a team of volunteers, contributors, and students, who dedicate their labor and time to recording the narratives of refugees of the Vietnam War. The recordings in this collection take the form of a podcast, Vietnamese Boat People, which is accessible both through the organization's website and on various podcasting platforms.

According to their website, "The Vietnamese Boat People podcast project is to preserve and carry forward the stories of this generation so that younger Vietnamese-Americans can understand and be inspired by their heritage. And if these stories evoke  others outside of this community to have more empathy towards the millions of refugees around the  world today, then this project has accomplished more than we had hoped for." </p><p>Source:</p><p>Vietnamese Boat People.

For most second generation Vietnamese children, their childhood looked nothing like that of their parents. They did not grow up during the Vietnam War era, nor do they have memories of the life threatening escapes from the country. Even so, this generation still internalizes the experiences, some through stories told by their parents, while others can feel the effects of the trauma, even if those stories were never told. The episode explores how this generation manages to understand their families' histories and trauma while also grappling with their own identities as Asian-Americans. Interviews include actress An Phan, podcast host Randy Kim, and visual storyteller Vi Son Trinh.</p></scopecontent></c></dsc>
