    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Equitable Building was the corporate headquarters of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, which was founded in 1859 by Henry Baldwin Hyde. Hyde started the company at age 25 as a small operation in a tiny office, but Equitable Life grew quickly in the decades after the Civil War, and by 1886 was the largest life insurance company in the world.  </p><p>In 1870, the company opened its new home office at 120 Broadway on the corner of Cedar Street. 
Designed by the firm of Gilman &amp; Kendall with consulting architect George B. Post, the Equitable Building was built on a larger scale than previous office buildings, and was among the first to use passenger elevators. Today the building is considered a major milestone in the development of the skyscraper. </p><p>On 9 January 1912, the building was destroyed by a fire that couldn't be properly contained due in part to the freezing weather. Water from the fire hoses froze quickly, and the ice impeded the efforts of the firefighters on the scene. Six people died in the fire, including FDNY Battalion Chief William Walsh. Although the building was destroyed, Equitable Life remained a viable company because their records were stored off-site, and because their vaults, holding several billion dollars in securities, stocks, bonds and cash, survived the blaze.</p><p>A new Equitable Building, designed by the architectural firm of E.R. Graham, was completed in 1915. The 38-story steel-frame building rose straight up from the street lot-line without any setbacks. It was the largest office building in the world at the time, and the last skyscraper to be constructed before building regulations were instituted in the city. The construction of the Equitable Building was an important catalyst for New York City's 1916 Zoning Resolution, the first in the country, which aimed to restrict the height and bulk of buildings and assure the penetration of light and air to the streets below. The Equitable Building was designated a New York City landmark in 1996.</p>  </bioghist>
