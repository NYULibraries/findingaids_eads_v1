    <abstract id="aspace_c2299b1dadb1511ad2b1fce2d3e2d4fa">The Morgan family papers, dated 1882 to 1929, contain ephemera and photographs from Thomas Morgan and members of his family. Items include two merit rewards from P.S. 56 to Thomas C. Morgan, as well as a merit reward from an unidentified school; an admission ticket to the St. George Swimming Club, located at the Hotel St. George; a map of sewers on Bushwick Avenue between Vigelius Street (now known as Jefferson Avenue) and Woodbine Street, denoting the home of Thomas and Charlotte Morgan; an 1882-1884 account book of Mrs. Thomas Morgan; and a court order to Charlotte E. Morgan regarding the estate of George Morgan, presumably Thomas C. and Charlotte E. Morgan's grandfather. Photographs in the collection include four images of the Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods in Brooklyn: two prints of the Morgan home at 1173 Bushwick Avenue; one print of the Bushwick Avenue Congregational Church; and a group portrait of students at P.S. 26, located at the time in Bedford-Stuyvesant near Quincy Street.</abstract>
