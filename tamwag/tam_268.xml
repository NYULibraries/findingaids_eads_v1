Yurick was a Brooklyn based writer whose novels shone a light on the poverty and violence in New York City in the 1960s and 1970s. The collection consists primarily drafts and manuscripts of Yurick's published works, but it also contains several manuscripts that were intended for but never reached publication. The collection also contains other materials related to the publication of his novels and stories, such as correspondence with publishers, contracts, and royalty statements.

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Sol Yurick (1925-2013) was an American author based in New York City, who was best known for novels portraying the grim realities of poverty and urban life in the 1960s and 1970s. Born in Manhattan on January 18, 1925, Yurick grew up in the Bronx where he attended the Bronx High School of Science. After high school he enlisted in the United States Army where he trained as a surgical technician during World War II. Yurick left the military in 1945 with a medical discharge due to an illness. Following his military service he enrolled in New York University on the GI Bill. At NYU pursued his interest in literature and graduated with a BA in English in 1951. He later received an MA in English from Brooklyn College.</p>
            <p>Yurick worked for several years as an investigator for the New York City Department of Welfare. This experience left Yurick critical of the city's welfare bureaucracy, which he believed was designed to control rather than aid the city’s poor. Yurick’s first book, 
                <emph render="italic">The Warriors</emph>, drew on his experience with the department of welfare and attempted to demonstrate that gang violence resulted from poverty rather than social dysfunction. Loosely based on the classical Greek story 
                <emph render="italic">Anabasis</emph>, Yurick hoped the novel would provide a more accurate portrayal of gangs as a corrective to glamorized images in pop culture such as 
                <emph render="italic">West Side Story</emph>. 
                <emph render="italic">The Warriors</emph> was later turned into a motion picture in 1979, which garnered a strong cult following.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>In the 1960s Yurick also became involved in the student protest movement and in the protests against the Vietnam War. Through his involvement he worked with Students for a Democratic Society and contributed the SDS tract, “Who Runs Columbia?”</p>
            <p>After the 1960s Yurick became less involved in political activism, but continued to write. His other works include a collection of short stories titled 
                <emph render="italic">Someone Just Like You</emph> (1972); an anthology titled 
                <emph render="italic">Voices of Brooklyn</emph> (1973); and several novels including, 
                <emph render="italic">An Island Death</emph> (1976), 
                <emph render="italic">Richard A</emph> (1981), and 
                <emph render="italic">Behold Metatron: The Recording Angel</emph> (1985). He also wrote several essays and short stories for the academic journal 
                <emph render="italic">Social Text</emph>, which is published through Duke University Press.</p>
            <p>Yurck lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn with his wife Adrienne. He died in January of 2013.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>This collection principally consists of typed manuscripts of novelist Sol Yurick’s published and unpublished works. Yurick's writings include numerous drafts of his novels, essays, short stories, and plays. These manuscripts cover much of Yurick's career from his early writings in the mid-1940s to the early 2000s. This collection contains several versions of Yurick's drafts, which show the various stages of Yurick's writing process, and contain the author's edits and revisions. Many of the manuscripts in this collection eventually resulted in published versions, but the collection also contains a number of unpublished manuscripts.</p>
            <p>The collection also contains a small number of materials related to Yurick's publications including correspondence with publishers, materials related to royalties, contracts, reviews, and documents related to film adaptations of Yurick's work. The collection also contains a small amount of personal items including correspondence with family and friends, journals, and materials related to Yurick's political activism.</p>
            <p>Titles for the drafts and manuscripts in this collection have been maintained as best as possible. Many of these titles appear in abbreviated or alternate forms, which Yurick used throughout his editing process. The folder titles in the file list reflect these changes and abbreviations. Additionally, there are many cases in which the pages within Yurick's drafts appear out of order. Throughout the editing process, Yurick often included additional pages to his drafts or renumbered certain sections. Consequently, there are a number of instances where pages will appear to be repetitive, missing, or out of order. While this is partially reflective of Yurick's editing methodology, there are also a number of instances where loose drafts and fragments became out of order prior to being archived, the original order of which is difficult to discern.</p>
