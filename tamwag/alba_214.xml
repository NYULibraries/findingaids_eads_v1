      <abstract id="aspace_c7f45487c00c7673f76ef59f5c5ec8a8">Harry Wilkes (1902-1938) served as a
        pharmacist for the American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy. Wilkes was a member of
        the first American medical unit to depart for Spain on January 16, 1937. After returning
        briefly to the U.S. in the fall 1937, Wilkes returned to Spain where he died in June 1938.
        Wilkes' death was reported to his family as a "heroic death" on the Lavatine Front; however,
        later evidence points to the official execution of Wilkes by Spanish Republican officials.
        Wilkes allegedly participated in the black market, trafficking in drugs, currency, and fine
        arts. This collection includes newspaper clippings that mention Wilkes. The bulk of the
        collection consists of correspondence, both letters written by Harry Wilkes to his family
        and letters addressed to Harry's father from the American Consulate in Spain and the U.S.
        Department of State on the discovery of Harry's death.</abstract>

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Harry Wilkes (1902-1938) served as a pharmacist for the American Medical Bureau to Aid
        Spanish Democracy. Prior to participating in the Spanish Civil War, Wilkes was on staff at
        Metropolitan Hospital in New York. Wilkes was a member of the first American unit that
        disembarked for Spain on January 16, 1937 aboard the liner "Paris." He helped set up the
        first American hospital in Romeral in February 1937. In October 1937, Wilkes returned to the
        U.S for six weeks on personal business. Upon his return he also bought supplies for the
        American Medical Bureau, and he engaged in a speaking tour to report conditions in Spain.
        Wilkes spent November and December of 1937 at a station on the Mediterranean coast. In
        January 1938, he served as chief pharmacist on a front just north of Madrid in the
        Guadarrama Mountains. Though Wilkes had reported to his family in April that he would return
        to the U.S. around July 4, 1938, Wilkes never made it home. After inquiring about the
        whereabouts of their son with the American Consulate in Spain and the U.S. Department of
        State, the Wilkes family learned that Harry Wilkes was killed on the Lavantine Front near
        Valencia on June 20. He was with the 14th Brigade of the International Brigades. Dr. Sidney
        Vogel in Barcelona sent the news in July 1938 to the American Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish
        Democracy that "Wilkes died a heroic death on the front while fulfilling his duties in
        defense of liberty and the Republic of Spain." It was many more months before the Wilkes
        family received specific information on the death of their son, finally learning that a
        sniper killed Harry as he was setting up an outpost on the front lines. This information was
        later discounted, as records provided evidence that Wilkes was actually executed by Spanish
        authorities after he supposedly participated in black market schemes, including transactions
        involving drugs, currency, and fine art.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p><emph render="bold">Series I, Subject Files (1937-1938)</emph>contains two 1937 newspaper
        clippings that mention Harry Wilkes' participation as a pharmacist with the American Medical
        Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy. The bulk of the series contains letters written from Harry
        Wilkes to his parents, sister, and other family members. In the many letters to his family,
        Wilkes describes the conditions of his work, though much less specifically to his parents.
        To his mother and father, Wilkes sends constant words of reassurance such as: "no regrets,"
        "no worry," and "food is plentiful." To his sister "Gus" and other family members, Wilkes
        describes more thoroughly daily conditions, such as the long working hours and his wish that
        more Americans would support Spain. He also discloses, however cautiously, his political
        beliefs. In one letter to his sister, Wilkes even explains the necessity of his ambiguity on
        political questions, writing that there are certain ideas that "we don't dare write about"
        in order to avoid incrimination. Wilkes frequent letters provide a good idea of his time in
        Spain. In the last letter, dated February 1938, Wilkes informs his father that he will be
        leaving Spain in June. This series includes replies from the American Consulate in Spain as
        well as the U.S. Department of State to Harry's father Samuel Wilkes as he attempted to
        learn the details of his son's death. The American Consulate provided Samuel Wilkes with a
        timeline of Harry's service in Spain and subsequent death.</p>
