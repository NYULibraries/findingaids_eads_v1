    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Women Poets of New York was formed in 1924. It was disbanded in 1987 because of declining membership. No records were maintained by the organization until the 1960s and 1970s when a member, Frances Higginson Savage, compiled this scrapbook. Consequently, the scrapbook holds no documents earlier than the 1950s and no later than the 1970s. With the termination of the group, a small balance of remaining funds was given to the Poetry Society of America and member Rhina Espaillat arranged for the scrapbook to be donated to N-YHS.</p><p>(The above note is based on documents in the scrapbook.)</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes one scrapbook holding poems composed by members of the Women Poets of New York from the 1950s to the 1970s. The poems are primarily published pieces clipped from publications such as "The Lyric," "Bronxville Villager," "Imprints Quarterly," "Voices," "Caravan," "University Review," "Educational Forum," "American Weave," "Point West," and others, as well as mainstream newspapers and other print sources. Some poems are in typescript, rather than published, form.</p><p>The poets are represented in the album with at least one, but often many, of their writings, with some brief biographical sketches and articles. The album holds two notes from 1987 providing context for the scrapbook and the termination of the group. A copy of the February 1988 newsletter of the Poetry Society of America includes a cover article about the Women Poets disbanding, with a few of the members' poems. </p><p>Poets represented in the album are:</p><p>* Sara Van Alstyne Allen</p><p>* Evelyn Ames</p><p>* Helen Bryant</p><p>* Isabel Harriss Barr</p><p>* Gertrude Ryder Bennett</p><p>* Laura Benét</p><p>* Elizabeth Bohm</p><p>* Joan Stanford Bishop</p><p>* Henrietta Cholmeley-Jones</p><p>* Jeannette Chappell</p><p>* Sara King Carleton</p><p>* Mary Ballard Duryee</p><p>* Mariana B.
