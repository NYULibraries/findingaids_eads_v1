<p>The collection was processed to only a minimal extent in 2020-21 by archivists Elise Winks and Larry Weimer. Consequently many documents remain roughly organized in original folders, and even loose in boxes in many cases. Nonetheless, given the size of the collection, some emphasis was placed on describing the collection, so the finding aid and container list is a fairly complete representation of the content.</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The firm Robert Ensko Inc. was a New York City-based purveyor, or retailer, of antique and reproduction British and American silver. The firm was incorporated in 1929 by its namesake and founder, Robert Ensko (1855-1934), and the present collection includes the records of the firm from that date of incorporation. But the firm pointed to 1878 as its founding year and Robert likely operated in a sole proprietorship capacity until 1929. Robert was well-known in the trade as the author of an important reference work, "Makers of American Silver," published in 1915. The firm was located at 682 Lexington Avenue in Manhattan.</p><p>At the time of incorporation in 1929, Robert continued as president of the firm, with his son Stephen G.C. (Guernsey Cook) Ensko as treasurer and a nephew, Charles Ensko, as secretary. Charles would retire and Robert would die soon after the firm's incorporation. Stephen (1896-1969), along with his brother, Lamont, remained as principal of the firm until his death. Stephen established himself as an authority on silver, authoring the first edition of "American Silversmiths and Their Marks" in 1927 and "English Silver 1675–1825" in 8 volumes, with Edward Wenham.</p><p>Stephen married Dorothea J. Winterloff (1892–1977) in 1918. They had three children, including Dorothea Charlotte (1920–2014), the donor of the collection to New-York Historical. Dorothea Charlotte married Vernon C. Wyle in 1944; Wyle was active in the family business for at least a time. After Stephen's death in December 1969, the firm continued business for a few months, but closed in 1970. The inventory was distributed to an extent among the family, with the rest auctioned.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes the records of the Robert Ensko Inc. company from around the time of its incorporation in 1929 to the close of the business in 1970. The records are particularly strong in documenting the firm's transactions with its clients/customers. The related records include correspondence, order tickets, invoices, shipping and contact lists, index cards of client transaction data, client "has and wants" lists, and ledgers. An especially notable client represented extensively in the records is the New York Racing Association, for which Ensko was the provider of trophies and other awards for races at Aqueduct, Belmont, and Saratoga from at least the late 1950s through 1970. The New York Yacht Club and Yale University are among the many other organizations that purchased silver presentation objects from Ensko.</p><p>Also well-represented in the collection are records relating to Ensko's transactions with its providers of antique and reproduction silver and engraving, and Ensko's inventory of objects. These records include invoices (bills paid) from the suppliers to Ensko, stock purchase journals, index cards of object-level data, correspondence with dealers, inventory catalogues, and the like. </p><p>Other records include correspondence concerning inquiries from museum curators, researchers and others about historical silversmiths; correspondence concerning appraisals of holdings by estates and others of silver objects, with some related inventories;  photographs (prints and negatives) of silver objects; research and reference notes on silversmiths; tax filings; general business expenses; and other material.</p>  </scopecontent>

The correspondents include individual collectors/purchasers, museum curators, historical researchers, appraisers, engravers, silversmiths, dealers and other suppliers, and university, association, and other institutional purchasers of silver objects. Among the more frequent institutional clients appearing in these files are various units of Yale University and the New York Racing Association, which purchased trophies from Ensko beginning in the late 1950s (and perhaps earlier) for races at Aqueduct, Belmont, and Saratoga. </p><p>The subject matter of the correspondence perhaps mostly concerns clients or potential clients seeking particular antique silver objects or reproductions of such objects. Requests for engraving are also common. Drawings and some photographs are found in the files as patrons described their objectives to Ensko. Ensko maintained relationships over the years with their individual clients and with their supply chain of dealers, engravers and silversmiths to satisfy client wishes, and so the correspondence reflects the ongoing development of silver collections through Ensko. The correspondence appears to be largely complete, running from 1936 (with a few letters back to 1934) through to the firm's close in 1970.</p><p>In addition to documentation of purchases and other business transactions, the correspondence includes other matters that Ensko assisted with, including answering historical research questions from independent historians, such as Helen Burr Smith, and curators at Albany Institute of History and Art, Detroit Institute of Arts, Yale University Art Gallery of Fine Art, and elsewhere. Ensko also was called on to offer both informal appraisals of objects and more formal appraisals of silver holdings in collections and estates; the appraised inventories are found at various points throughout the files. Ensko also occasionally loaned objects for exhibition at museums and elsewhere and that is documented in these files.</p><p>The files also include some personal correspondence at points, and correspondence with the firm's attorneys and accountants that run on the border of personal and professional. The set of correspondence for January-June 1936 includes letters from the Smithsonian concerning British assay office receipts; six receipts dated 1796-98 were enclosed for Stephen Ensko to keep and these are in the files as reflected in the series' date range.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f26c2dda7df4e7e79d61cca01e80ce97"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series retains its original order, which includes multiple sets of letters arranged alphabetically by correspondent. The sets advance in rough chronological order from the 1930s to 1970. There is a fair amount of inconsistency though in the files. In terms of chronology, some sets consist entirely of letters from one particular year, while others include letters from a wider range of time. More uneven is how correspondents, especially those from institutions, were filed in the alphabetical sequence. For example, correspondence with Yale University representatives can be found under Y, or under the letter of the individual correspondent, such as P for John M. Phillips or S for Theodore Sizer. Dealers with personal names in their firm name, such as I. Freeman and Son, will typically be found under the surname (F), not the lead letter of the company. These too might be found under a personal name, for example, the dealer Polly's Shop is found under P and under E for the proprietor, Polly Edwards. There are likely other idiosyncrasies not observed during processing; accordingly, patrons should be sure not to tailor their search in the files too narrowly.</p></arrangement><userestrict id="aspace_9c41df189b053f6602ac9e61f952b486"><head>Conditions Governing Use</head><p>The files hold the carbon copies of the firm's outgoing letters. These were typed mostly on highly acidic paper, which is crumbling and breaks apart easily when handled. Accordingly, patrons should be careful when handling these documents to minimize damage to them.</p></userestrict><c id="aspace_6c41b5979cc596c0c1988953431d92f1" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1796-1798, 1934-1939</unitdate><container id="aspace_1a58fb089c37fdceed09ba0a9f80d994" label="Mixed Materials" type="Offsite-Box">59</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9e8ec76837eaf3b5720de17df1f4d48f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Includes the sets of general correspondence for January-June 1936 and July-December 1936, and the set of correspondence (1936-1939) related to orders of "American Silversmiths and Their Marks II," with acknowledgements from libraries and others of donated copies from Ensko.

Several albums include photos of trophies, with information about them, supplied by Robert Ensko Inc. to the New York Racing Association (NYRA) for "Run of the Mill" and "Stake" races at Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga in 1960-1966. There is also a set of three albums with photos (and a small box of negatives) of the Firestone Collection, which according to a note in the albums was appraised by Stephen G.C. Ensko. </p><p>Beyond these albums, there are many other photographs, though their particular context is not clear. A large set of organized photograph files, originally in filing cabinets when received at N-YHS, seem likely to be mostly of objects that were in Ensko's inventory or of at least specific relevance to their business. These files include both photographic prints and negatives. They include both antiques and reproductions of styles designated on some folder labels as "English silver," "Sheffield," "antique English," "early American" (often abbreviated as E.A.), and "modern." The photos remain in their original folders with Ensko's labeling. Objects include trays, creamers, bowls, candlesticks, cups, coffee and tea sets, dishes, urns, strainers, porringers, tankards, shakers, sauce boats, flatware, Apostle spoons, etc. A separate set of several small boxes of negatives seem likely to relate to images of Ensko's inventory as well. </p><p>Retained in their original flat letter boxes as received at N-YHS are various photographs and other image formats that appear to be more research or reference-oriented, such as for Ensko's books, appraisals, client inquiries, etc. The content of these letter boxes were not closely examined by the processing archivist in 2021 and were left largely as found in the boxes. While much is simply loosely piled in the boxes, there are discernable relationships among some of the grouped photographs, such as maker, style, marks, collection, etc. These materials include annotations, brief notes, and other documentation. A few unrelated items, such as personal notes, a 1918 wedding invitation, and a 1787 newspaper, are found randomly among these documents.</p><p>Finally, there are three boxes of pictorial works, including bound copies of tearsheets of advertisements and articles about silver, a few museum exhibition and auction catalogues, booklets, postcards, and the like. Specific to Ensko are two copies of a small booklet published in 1934 by the firm that seems to be a primer on antique American silver for its clients or potential clients.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_fd4c01b8376fe3683d96c14d79e3be1a"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is arranged with photographs followed by pictorial material.

The cards were not reviewed sufficiently during processing to say definitively what their interrelationship is or what the notations all mean. But generally the cards appear to indicate date(s) of acquisition and dates of sale. Some cards have more detail than others. There appear to have been at least 4 numerical sequences/sets of cards over time: one initiated in the early 1930s, a second starting in the mid-1930s and extending to 1954, a third ranging from 1955 to 1967, and a fourth from 1968-1970. But there are other sets of cards related to inventory that are unclear as to how they relate to the others. Also, cards initiated in one year/period may have notations of a different year/period on them.</p><p>This first box holds what appears to be an early set of cards, dating from the early 1930s. The box also holds the beginning of a much larger set of cards that were initiated in the mid-1930s and eventually ended in the mid-1950s; this set continues in the following boxes.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8f74ab71074fe4ef3e5acf7c71400f73" level="file"><did><unittitle>Index cards: Objects in inventory (Box 2 of 7)</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1940s-1950s</unitdate><container id="aspace_7ba3c4b0f1e4af3277e58423b35165b0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Offsite-Box">115</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_9cae4d485078afded5abdf39365fe05f"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This box continues the set of cards begun in the 1930s and that extends to 1955.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_fba8e86285ebe91453d38fa556a48050" level="file"><did><unittitle>Index cards: Objects in inventory (Box 3 of 7)</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1950s</unitdate><container id="aspace_86347b63881d00b43a63ef153bc82504" label="Mixed Materials" type="Offsite-Box">116</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_8c721a0562002950a20e5dbebefc3e53"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This box continues the set of cards begun in the 1930s and extending to the mid 1950s.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_8d62d8302a115ef43e7f9b0945e57815" level="file"><did><unittitle>Index cards: Objects in inventory (Box 4 of 7)</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1950s-1960s</unitdate><container id="aspace_c5c4525162b261787f2d53abd0f45524" label="Mixed Materials" type="Offsite-Box">117</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_52a27556016cb9b76f61c192bcd2cbf2"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This box concludes the set of cards begun in the 1930s and ending in 1954.

Transaction tickets record client/customer object sales, repairs, engravings, and other client-related matters such as returns and credit memos. Data on the tickets include client name and address, object or service purchased, stock number, price, transaction and shipment date, shipping address, and other pertinent details.</p><p>There is a high degree of redundancy in the series because there are as many as three copies of the tickets: one arranged and bound in alphabetical order by client, one arranged by ticket number (very roughly chronological), and for some, a third (pink color) copy. Nonetheless, for the earliest records in the series, from the early 1940s, there is only one copy of the ticket.</p><p>The invoices are carbon copies of the originals sent to customers. The invoices include much of the same information found on the tickets, but in much more polished form. The tickets are handwritten, often with detailed working notes and customer specifications. The invoices are typed lists or straightforward notes of the item or service purchased.</p><p>Taken together, the documents appear to be a comprehensive, detailed view of Ensko's client transactions. </p><p>A detailed understanding of the interrelationship of these documents and others from the business can be gleaned from a 1954 "Client order procedure" found in Series IV (Box 75). This was a procedural document apparently written for a new typist. The essentials of it seem to be relevant for tickets from the 1940s on through 1970.</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_ab001f65639cfdc9d5848099e6d9cf94"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The series is organized by the three overall sales transaction-related sets of documents in the collection:</p><p>Series V.A.

These are the same tickets as those in Subseries V.A., except that 1) the tickets in this subseries extend back to 1941-1945, which those in subseries V.A. do not and 2) these tickets are arranged in ticket number order, not by client/customer. It is also unknown if perhaps certain details are on one set of the tickets and not the other. For tickets dating from 1957-1970, the subseries includes a duplicate set (pink color form).</p></scopecontent><arrangement id="aspace_f1a133b632290666a6d337c4dcc8466f"><head>Arrangement</head><p>The subseries is arranged in very rough chronological order. It retains the documents' original order, which is by pre-stamped sequential ticket number. These sequence numbers do not strictly correspond to transaction chronology. It appears that, at least in the mid-1940s and later, multiple ticket books were in use at any one time and that within an order book, transactions were recorded on pages more or less at random. So transactions for a particular period of time can be found at various points in the order ticket sequence. Except for the earliest tickets, which are in booklets, the used tickets were secured together in thick stacks of a 1000 or more in two-pronged binders. The container list records the sequence numbers of each of these stacks and the approximate date range of each stack. The date range was determined by quick skims by the processing archivist and its precision is uncertain. </p><p>The documents make it apparent that Ensko used one run of sequence numbers from 1941 to 1958, and then restarted the numbering in 1958. This second run was used until the business closed in 1970. The container list distinguishes between this "1st run" and "2nd run." </p><p>The bulk of the duplicate (pink) copies of the tickets in the subseries pertain to the 2nd run and are presented in the container list after the primary copy. The few pink copies that pertain to the 1st run are listed after that.</p></arrangement><c id="aspace_020fe6a44801349cb43d3ed454546cb9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Sales tickets. 1st run, 1941-1958.
