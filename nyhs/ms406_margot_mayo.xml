    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Margot Mayo was a teacher of music and dance in the New York City school system, and perhaps best known for her connections with American folk music and square dancing. (Margot is not to be confused with the actress Margaret Mayo.) She was born in Texas in 1910, moving in the 1930s to New York where she lived the rest of her life. She was a founder of the American Square Dance Group in 1934, editor of the magazine Promenade, and author of "The American Square Dance" in 1943. Mayo died in New York in 1974.</p><p>(This note was based on Mayo's entry in Wikipedia.)</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The collection has been only minimally processed. The documents for the most part remain in the original index card boxes, letterbox, and folders as received by N-YHS. The collection was first cataloged in 1985. This finding aid was prepared by archivist Larry Weimer in September 2021</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes research notes compiled by Margot Mayo, mostly concerning the history of dance, dancers, and dancing instruction in New York City and the nation from 1730-1900. The bulk of the collection consists of index cards with notes, often very brief, on individual dancers or topics. These may have been compiled in connection with an unrealized book project by Mayo as there are also fragmentary manuscript writings for chapters on the history of dancing/dancers in New York City.</p>  </scopecontent>
