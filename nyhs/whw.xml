            <p>The collection contains correspondence, architectural drawings, photographs, clippings, and other material related to the personal and professional life of William Halsey Wood. A primary focus is his design for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Additionally, there are drawings and clippings related to approximately two dozen additional projects, the majority of which are churches. The design for his home "Winmarleigh" in Newark, NJ is also prominent. Correspondence and other personal materials describe the architect's youth and wedding, followed later by his illness and death.</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>William Halsey Wood (1855-1897) was born on April 24, 1855 in Danville, NY to Daniel Halsey Wood and Hannah Bell Lippincott. The family moved to Newark, NJ, where Halsey Wood was educated at the Episcopal House of Prayer parish school. In 1870 he began an apprenticeship with the architect John F. Miller in Newark. After leaving the unsuccessful firm Taylor, Roberts and Wood, he opened his own office in 1879. The same year, he completed the William Clark House, which was followed by a number of other notable domestic projects, including his own home, “Winmarleigh”.</p>
            <p>His ecclesiastical designs, meanwhile, reached a height in 1888, when he entered his drawings for “Jerusalem, the Golden” into the design competition for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. While his design was not ultimately accepted, he continued to work on a number of other prominent religious buildings, primarily Episcopal churches in New Jersey and New York. Like other noteworthy architects of the period, he tended to embrace a version of eclecticism that combined historic European styles with modern American sensibilities.</p>
            <p>In 1889 he married Florence Hemsley in Tannersville, NY. They had three children. Halsey Wood died in 1897 in Philadelphia, PA at age 41.</p>

                        <p>The correspondence consists primarily of letters written by William Halsey Wood to his fiancé Florence Hemsley in the months leading up their marriage in 1889. Wedding preparations are the focus of this correspondence, but there is also mention of the work being done on Peddie Memorial Church, the plans for the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, and a meeting with Andrew Carnegie. There are also letters to WHW from Florence Hemsley (Florence H. Wood) and her mother, Emily Hemsley, as well as correspondence regarding the illness and death of WHW. The correspondence is partially catalogued at item level in the onsite manuscript card catalog.</p>
