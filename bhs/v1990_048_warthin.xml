    <head>Biographical note</head>
<p>Virginia W. Warthin (nee Whittier; 1912-1995) was the great granddaughter of James Eaton, a Brooklyn resident who owned land on Schermerhorn Street in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. Her grandmother and great aunt were Virginia and Sarah Eaton who grew up in Brooklyn and attended public schools, including P.S. 6. In 1918, the family's land on Schermerhorn Street was taken by eminent domain on which the city built the Children's Court. The family then moved to Sidney Place, also in Brooklyn Heights. Virginia W. Warthin attended Brooklyn Friends School. She later married Thomas A. Warthin, a physician, and they had three sons. After retirement, the Warthins lived in Walpole, MA.</p>  </bioghist>
