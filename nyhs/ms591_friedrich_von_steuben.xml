<p> The physical collection consists of 15 boxes of correspondence and writings (1 oversize) from 1778 to 1851 and 6 volumes. Many documents are in French.</p><p>The bulk of the correspondence (1779-1781) concerns Steuben's efforts to reorganize the Continental Army and to make Virginia a base of General Nathaniel Greene's army during Steuben's command of forces there. They relate to matters including the preparation and distribution of his Regulations, reactions to and questions about his work, appointment of inspectors, supply needs, organization and administration of army and militia units, enemy movements and strength, and British forces in Virgina, among other topics.</p><p>Steuben's correspondents include Col. Jean Baptiste Ternant, Col. William Davies, the Board of War, M. de Franey, Chevalier de la Luzerne, Gen. Nathanael Greene, Gov. Thomas Jefferson, Col. Edward Carrington, Col. George Gibson, Gen.
