    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>The third son of John and Francis (Frye) Duer, William Duer was born in Devonshire, England, on March 18, 1747. After a brief stint as aide-de-camp to Lord Clive in India and a few years of work on the family plantations in the Caribbean, Duer moved to the colony of New York in 1773. Duer had, on a previous trip to the area, purchased tracts of land on the North (Hudson) River near Albany. The area, known as Fort Miller, served both as Duer's first residence and as the site of his early financial ventures. Duer set up sawmills, warehouses, and a store, and, by 1776, had built a moderately successful mercantile business based primarily on lumber production.</p><p>A supporter of independence, Duer was an active member of the New York State Convention and went on to serve in the Continental Congress. Duer's public career ended in 1790 when he resigned from the Treasury Department where he had served as assistant secretary under his friend Alexander Hamilton.</p><p>Duer, however, gained much more notoriety from his financial dealings than from his contributions as a public servant. One of his first large-scale projects was to supply Continental troops with food during the Revolutionary War. Duer gained real economic stature, however, in the 1780s with his large land and stock speculations. Prominent among them was the Scioto speculation, through which Duer and his associates secured the right to purchase from the United States a large tract of western lands, which they in turn decided to sell chiefly to capitalists abroad, particularly in France and Holland.</p><p>Duer found himself severely overextended in the 1790s and he faced financial ruin when a suit was brought against him by the government regarding two unbalanced charges while he was with the treasury board. Unable to satisfy his creditors, Duer was arrested on March 23, 1792, and sent to debtors' prison. Duer's economic ties were so wide in the area that his financial collapse set off the first financial panic in New York City.</p><p>Duer remained in prison until his death on May 7, 1799.</p><p>He was married to the former Catherine Alexander, daughter of William Alexander, Lord Stirling, a general in the Revolutionary War. They had one son, William Alexander Duer (1780-1858), who later served as president of Columbia College.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The William Duer Papers consist largely of correspondence (in English, with a few letters in French), accounts, contracts, financial documents and legal manuscripts. They are the products of William Duer, his family, and his associates. The bulk relate to financial activities, with far smaller amounts related to Duer's government work, his Revolutionary correspondence, and his personal life.</p><p>Parts of the collection have been microfilmed onto four reels; those portions of the collection will be brought to the researcher in microfilm format. In the container list below, folders that have been microfilmed are identified by a three-digit number separated by a hypen (e.g., 1-21), which denotes the reel and folder number where the material can be found. Because the physical collection has been rehoused since it was microfilmed, the physical folder and microfilm folder numbers do not always correspond.</p>  </scopecontent>

They are numbered in pencil from 1-138 (volume 1) and 139-257 (volume 2). The timber contracts pertain to agreements with the governments of Spain and France to supply timber for ship masts and spars. Silas Deane, James Wilson, and Mark Bird were also associated with this enterprise. The remainder of this volume appears to have been used for penmanship practice and casual use.</p><p> Volumes 1 and 2 are available on reel 3 of the microfilm.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref169_7qv" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence (reel 3)</unittitle><unitdate>1776-1783</unitdate><container id="aspace_dcebdd5ac1e99cd67da0f7909957375c" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">1</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref170_6ct" level="file"><did><unittitle>Correspondence (reel 3)</unittitle><unitdate>1784-1802</unitdate><container id="aspace_ea6e76dc4b6fecd8710513a617832f9b" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">2</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref171_dod" level="file"><did><unittitle>Timber contracts</unittitle><unitdate>1774-1779</unitdate><container id="aspace_da383ba999cf7eeea3a1bf91b675d241" label="Mixed Materials" type="Volume">3</container></did></c></c></dsc>
