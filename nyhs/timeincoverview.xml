    <abstract id="aspace_a39211b7ff63548d25cbd8f93952c840">The Time Inc. Records document the history of the company from its incorporation in 1922 through the early twenty-first century. The record groups Subject Files, Bio Files, Reference Files, and Annex Files are collections assembled by the Time Inc. Archives that document the history of Time Inc., its departments, and its staff. Other record groups contain files directly from corporate offices and the offices of the editorial and publishing sides of the various publications and other departments at Time Inc. along with smaller collections assembled by the Time Inc. Archives and Library. Because departments frequently collaborated on projects and events or received the same updates via group memoranda or reports, records on the same topic may be found in several record groups or series. These records will generally reflect different viewpoints on the same topic. This Guide is an overview of the portion of the archive that is processed and open to researchers. More detailed description of the content is included in the Guides for the individual record groups that constitute the archive.</abstract>

<emph render="bold">HISTORY OF TIME INC.</emph><lb/>

<p>For a comprehensive history of Time Inc. and its founders, see the authorized histories of Time Inc. listed in the citations at the end.</p>

<p>Henry Robinson Luce and Briton Hadden met while classmates at the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. They became friends while working on rival school publications. Both went on to Yale University and joined the Yale <title render="italic">Daily News</title> as freshmen. After graduation in 1920, Luce and Hadden went their separate ways. Luce traveled, briefly studied at Oxford, and worked at <title render="italic">The Chicago Daily News</title>. Hadden also traveled and worked at <title render="italic">The New York World</title>. Ultimately both ended up working at <title render="italic">The Baltimore News</title> in 1922.</p>

<p>There they conceived of the magazine that became <title render="italic">Time</title>, with the working title <title render="italic">Facts</title>, before forming Time, Incorporated on November 28, 1922 in New York. They published the first issue on March 3, 1923 with a circulation of around 9,000. Luce and Hadden alternated as the president of the company, but shared the masthead as managing editors. Hadden died suddenly in 1929. Luce died in 1967.</p>

<p>Besides the flagship magazine, Time Inc. also launched <title render="italic">Fortune</title>, <title render="italic">Life</title>, <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title>, and <title render="italic">People</title>, along with the radio news program <title render="italic">March of Time</title>. Time Inc. created divisions for wider entertainment offerings such as Time-Life Books and the cable television channel Home Box Office, later known as HBO, and subsidiaries to handle the technical side of printing such as Printing Developments, Inc. Time Inc. also acquired companies such as publisher Little, Brown and Company, and lumber company Temple Industries; and publications such as <title render="italic">Architectural Forum</title> and the Washington <title render="italic">Star</title>. In 1990, Time Inc. merged with Warner Communications Inc. resulting in Time Warner. Time Inc., the magazine publishing branch, separated from Time Warner in 2014.</p>

<lb/>
<emph render="bold">ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CORPORATE ARCHIVES</emph>
<lb/>

<p>The earliest documentation regarding the establishment of the Time Inc. Archives dates from 1941, when a proposal was sent to one of the company's top executives, stating, "We are in favor of starting a confidential file of Archives, which can be kept up to date and which, as time goes on, should prove invaluable for...a comprehensive history of the company...Things we'd like to save:  original dummies, prospectuses, and first copies of all the magazines, complete sets of annual reports, complete and up to date material on H.R.L. and his writings, a complete set of all company bulletins, pictures, diaries and personal accounts of all early employees, etc...But there is at present, so far as I know, no systematic effort to keep track of all documents which have long range value to the company...Main thing I am anxious to establish is the habit of saving valuable material.  If you approve the project, we can start delving almost at once." </p>

<p>In 1950, after passing through the hands of several long time employees, the Archives Department was formally established, reporting up to the company's Central Services division.</p>
 
<lb/>
<emph render="bold">REASON FOR ESTABLISHING ARCHIVES</emph><lb/>

<p>One of the guiding reasons for establishing the Archive was, as noted above, that as early as 1941, Time Inc. was considering a "comprehensive history of the company."  A memo in an Archives folder in the Reference Files, from April 1950, expresses the desire for a "definitive, scholarly history of Time Inc."  Three authorized histories have been published so far:</p>


<p>Elson, Robert T. 1968. <title render="italic">Time, Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1923-1941</title>. New York: Atheneum.</p>

<p>Elson, Robert T., and Duncan Norton-Taylor. 1973. <title render="italic">The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1941-1960</title>. New York: Atheneum.</p>

<p>Prendergast, Curtis, and Geoffrey Colvin. 1986. <title render="italic">The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise, 1960-1980</title>. New York: Atheneum.</p>

<p>According to Robert T. Elson, "Luce had a very strong sense of history, and a feeling that Time Inc. was a unique institution.  What he wanted was a record of the men and women who worked there."</p>    <chronlist>

    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
<p>The Time Inc. Records document the history of the company from its incorporation in 1922 through the early twenty-first century. Because departments frequently collaborated on projects and events or received the same updates via group memoranda or reports, records on the same topic may be found in several record groups or series. These records will generally reflect different viewpoints on the same topic. Records throughout the collection frequently use the shorthand "34th" to refer to the corporate level offices whcih were on the 34th floor of the Manhattan Time &amp; Life Building, and "541" to refer to the Chicago Time &amp; Life Building.</p>
<p>The four major record groups that document the history of the company as a whole include the Subject Files, created as a reference tool for the writers of authorized histories of Time Inc., focusing on the areas of corporate, editorial, and publishing; the Bio Files documenting the careers of Time Inc. staff, non-staff closely associated with the company, and notable figures; the Reference Files, originally Time Inc.'s central file, documenting the history of various Time Inc. divisions, franchises, and staff organizations, along with runs of staff newsletters; and the Annex Files, an extension of the types of records kept in the Subject Files, but not part of that record group.</p>
<p>
Additional record groups that relate to the entire company include the Corporate Administration Records containing files from the corporate-level offices and executives of Time Inc. as well as stock certificates, five-year plans, notary seals, patents, printing agreements, and organizational records from affiliates and subsidiaries; the New Building Department Records documenting the design, construction, and furnishing of the Time &amp; Life Building at Rockefeller Center; the Administration, Human Resources and Personnel Records documenting employee relations, benefits, and personnel policies; Staff Organizations documenting membership organizations involving only Time Inc. staff; the Real Estate Division Records on building and land purchases, construction, and alternations for offices and other facilities of Time Inc. and its subsidiaries; Corporate Public Affairs Department Records documenting the promotion of Time Inc. through newstours, radio and television appearances, community projects, and speeches to groups in the publishing arena; the Time Inc. Annual Reports documenting the creation of new departments and new ventures; transcripts and recordings of staff interviews from an oral history project undertaken by the Time Inc. Archives; files from the Production Department about the supply of paper products and the subsidiary the East Texas Pulp and Paper Company (Eastex); files on the creation of a new corporate logo and trademark; the Corporate Circulation Records documenting the marketing of subscriptions for all of the company's magazines; the Travel Services Records regarding business travel arrangements for Time Inc. employees; the Company Services Records containing flight logs of an aircraft owned by Time Inc. and invoices for purchase of various items of office furniture and equipment; the records of the Comptroller documenting the accounting and financial reporting for the whole company; the realia collected by the Time Inc. Archives documenting branded material created by Time Inc. or awards received by Time Inc.; Time Inc.'s corporate identity rebranding; and Time Inc. International records documenting Time Inc.'s publishing efforts outside of the United States.</p>
<p>Records groups from the editorial side of Time Inc. may include files from a magazine's managing editors, executive editors, and art departments. Of note are the Corporate Editorial Records, a department overseeing all publications at Time Inc. and containing files from Editors-in-Chief Donovan Hedley, Henry Grunwald, and Jason McManus; and the Magazine Development Group's work on designing and launching new magazines.</p>
<p>Other editorial record groups include <title render="italic">Time</title> Editorial Records; <title render="italic">Fortune</title> Editorial Records; <title render="italic">Life</title> Editorial Records; <title render="italic">People</title> Editorial Records; <title render="italic">Money</title> Editorial Records; <title render="italic">Architectural Forum</title> and <title render="italic">House &amp; Home</title> Editorial Records; <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title> Editorial Records; and <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated for Kids</title> Records.

<p>Reference materials used by editorial staff include the Index Cards containing groups of index cards used for searching and cross referencing subject terms in Time Inc.'s major magazines; and files on people, presidents, and subjects from the <title render="italic">Time</title> Research Center.</p>
<p>Records groups from the business and publishing side of Time Inc. may include files from a magazine's publishers, business managers, general managers, and advertising, promotion, and circulation departments. Of note are the Advertising Promotion and Circulation Promotion Files assembled by the Time Inc. Archives and containing records and mailings from the advertising promotion and circulation promotion departments of many Time Inc. publications.</p>

The Time Inc. Invitational Records document an annual invitation-only sporting event organized by the magazines' Advertising Sales Departments and held to foster relationships with advertisers. The Time Inc. Postal Rates Records document Time Inc. advocating for its position on postal rates for mailing publications.</p>

Records regarding the subsidiary that published the Canadian edition of <title render="italic">Time</title>; and Selling Areas-Marketing, Inc. (SAMI) which produced reports on the sale of consumer goods and offered them for sale by subscription.

The Time Inc. Archives originally assembled and arranged the Subject Files for use by writers and researchers working on three authorized volumes of Time Inc. history.

Corporate covers the acquisition and sale of entities as well as contracts and agreements between organizations, negotiations, board meetings, and other similar business relations. Editorial or Edit relates to the work being done by correspondents, reporters, and researchers. Publishing includes everything from advertising and promotion to production and circulation.</p><p>Additional records on the divisions, departments and offices at Time Inc. are in the Time Inc.
