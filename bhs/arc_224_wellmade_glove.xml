    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>Wellmade Glove (later Wellmade Gloves) was a glove shop and manufacturer specializing in fine gloves produced from fabric and goat skin.  The company was located at 480 Seventh Avenue in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Park Slope, and was owned and operated by Louis Lebman (1880-1969), a Polish immigrant who served his glovemaking apprenticeship in Gloversville, N.Y.  Lebman lived with his wife, Rose, and their daughter, Maria, in the same building that housed Wellmade Glove.</p>  </bioghist>
