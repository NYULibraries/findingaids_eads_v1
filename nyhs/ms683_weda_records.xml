          <event>After a complaint about the high price of dinners at the Union Club, a recently founded New York City men's social club, Alexander R. Wyckoff states that he could cater a dinner that was filling, yet inexpensive. Seventeen other Union Club members attend his dinner. The same group decides to throw a similar dinner catered by a different member. The men begin to meet on a regular basis and take the name "the Benedictines." The name is soon changed to "WEDA" to represent the "Wyckoff Economical Dining Association."</event>

          <event>WEDA Secretary William D. Robinson writes a report that includes a history of the club. He states that the members of WEDA have continually met once a month from October through May for 33 years at various clubhouses for dinner. Men who attend the dinners pay a fee for the meal, and men who cannot attend the dinners are charged a small fine. It is unclear if the men in WEDA must also be Union Club members.</event>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The WEDA (Wyckoff Economical Dining Association) Collection contains documentation of a New York City men's club whose purpose was to meet for dinner once a month. It is arranged according to type of material and includes menus, photographs, correspondence, reports of the secretary, bills, and receipts.</p><p>The bulk of the material is scrapbooks that contain menus for each dinner meeting documented and lists of members in attendance. Although the organization was formed in 1838, the scrapbooks and minutes of the meetings do not begin until 1886. It is unclear how often the club met between 1838-1886. But, the scrapbooks contain a comprehensive collection of menus for almost every WEDA meeting from 1886-1955 and provide a look into food consumed by upper class men during that time. For example, the menus from the nineteenth century report a large amount of seafood for dinner including green turtle soup and a wide variety of oysters. The menus in the twentieth century have other dishes, such as caviar, and dinners that include more meat and less seafood. The menus also list other items named after the club such as "Weda Club Chowder" and "Weda Punch." A 1901 Report of the Secretary also includes a complete listing of minutes and menus from April 1886 until May 1901.</p><p>The material supports research on the history of men's clubs. Prominent New York men were members, and they met at existing clubs such as the Knickerbocker Club, the Union League Club, and the Metropolitan Club. The records list members' names and does not include much personal information about them. There are also few indications of current events or any political or economic discussions that might have taken place at the meetings. Events such as the Great Depression and the First and Second World Wars are almost completely absent from reports of the meetings. The only reflection of current affairs in the scrapbooks is a mention that the 1943 April meeting was the first one to be held with war rationing. </p>  </scopecontent>
