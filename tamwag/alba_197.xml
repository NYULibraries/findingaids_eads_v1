        in Philadelphia in 1915. A trained nurse, Bell went to Spain in 1937 where she worked in
        several hospitals and a mobile unit. She returned to the States in December 1938. The
        collection consists of (a portion of?) a scrapbook compiled in a Murcia hospital and a short

      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Hilda Bell Roberts was born Hilda Bell in Philadelphia in 1915, graduating from the Jewish
        Hospital School of Nursing in 1937. She went to Spain in May of 1937 as a volunteer nurse
        with the Medical Bureau to Aid Spanish Democracy, sailing on the S.S. Normandie. In Spain
        she worked as a staff nurse in the operating room at the Universidad Hospital and the Cruz
        Roja Hospital in Murcia before transferring to the Aragon front. There she traveled with the
        autochir, a mobile hospital that set up surgical units in a variety of temporary locations,
        including an unused railway tunnel, a nut factory, and a mansion. Bell was evacuated from
        Spain in December 1938 along with other International Brigade volunteers.</p>
      <p>Bell served in World War II as a U.S. Army nurse in Australia and New Guinea. A nurse
        throughout her life, Bell also taught psychiatric nursing in San Francisco. She remained
        active in a range of social causes, including the anti-nuclear and ecology movements. She
        traveled to Nicaragua in 1986 with the Elders for Survival and participated in a weekly
        vigil to oppose Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Bell returned to Spain with
        other International Brigades veterans in 1996.</p>
      <p>Bell married in 1945, changing her name to Hilda Bell Kirk, and remarried in 1965, becoming
        Hilda Bell Roberts. She had one son by her first marriage, and two stepsons.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The collection consists of two items:the short story, which Bell wrote for an English class
        in 1952, is a work of fiction based upon an incident that she witnessed in a Murcia
        hospital; the scrapbook, containing a child's drawing, handwritten tributes and pages of a
        printed brochure, was compiled in a Murcia hospital on a ward where Bell was floor
        nurse.</p>
